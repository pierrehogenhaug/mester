**Banff Merger Sub Inc.**
to be merged with and into
**Boxer Parent Company Inc.**
$1,475,000,000 Senior Notes due 2026
€301,500,000 Senior Notes due 2026

Banff Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”) is offering $1,475.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9.750% senior notes due 2026 (the “Dollar Notes”) and
€301.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.375% senior notes due 2026 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes,” and each a
separate “series” of Notes). The Dollar Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 9.750%, which will be paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and
September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2019. The Dollar Notes will mature on September 1, 2026. The Euro Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of
8.375%, which will be paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2019. The Euro Notes will mature
on September 1, 2026.
This offering is being made in connection with the proposed acquisition of Boxer Parent Company Inc. (the “Company”) by entities affiliated with KKR & Co.
Inc. (“KKR”) (the “Merger”). Merger Sub has been formed for the sole purpose of completing the Merger and, at the closing of the Merger, will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will
execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement (as defined herein) and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross proceeds from this offering of each series of
Notes into segregated escrow accounts for the benefit of the holders of each series of Notes pending the consummation of the Merger (collectively, the “Escrow
Accounts”). The release of escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of
the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval.
If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to February 26, 2019 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), and upon the occurrence of certain other events, the escrow
proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the
purpose of redeeming each series of the Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The special
mandatory redemption price of each series of Notes will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
from the issue date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on each series
of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and its affiliates
will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in
each Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the special
mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Notes will be solely obligations of Merger Sub and will not be guaranteed and will not otherwise be the beneficiary of
any credit support from the Company or any of its subsidiaries. From and after the consummation of the Merger, each of the Company’s existing and future wholly-owned
domestic restricted subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes on a senior unsecured basis to the extent such subsidiary guarantees our new Credit Facilities (as defined herein) or
certain of our other indebtedness, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, each series of Notes will be secured by a first priority security interest in the applicable Escrow Account and
Escrowed Property (as defined herein). From and after the consummation of the Merger, the Notes and the note guarantees will be our and the guarantors’ senior
unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and the guarantors, rank pari
passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company and the guarantors, be effectively subordinated to all existing and future
secured indebtedness of the Company and the guarantors, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness, and be structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee
the Notes. To the extent lenders under our new Credit Facilities release any guarantor from its obligations, such guarantor will also be released from its obligations
under its note guarantees. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”
At any time prior to September 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of each series of Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering circular. On
or after September 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of each series of Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering circular applicable to
each series, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time prior to September 1, 2021, we may also redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes using the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” The Notes of
either series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part before the Notes of the other series are optionally redeemed in full (or at all).
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein), we may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes then outstanding at a
price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. See “Description of Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

_Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 40 of this offering circular._

**Offering Price of the Dollar Notes: 9.750%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from August 23, 2018**
**Offering Price of the Euro Notes: 8.375%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from August 23, 2018**
The Notes and note guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes will not have the benefit of any registration rights. Unless they are registered, the Notes may be offered only in
transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we are offering the Notes only to
persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in
compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may
be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For further details about eligible offerees and resale
restrictions, see “Notice to Investors.”
Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or
determined if this offering circular is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
There is currently no public market for the Notes. The Dollar Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. The Issuer
intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). The listing application will be subject to approval by The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”), which is licensed to operate an investment exchange by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission
under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, as amended. The Exchange is not a regulated market for the purposes of EU Directive
2004/39/EC (as amended), or the “Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.” There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trade on the
Official List of the Exchange. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application for or obtaining such listing or
admission to trading.
**The initial purchasers expect to deliver the Dollar Notes to investors only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company and**
**the Euro Notes only in book-entry form through Euroclear and Clearstream (each as defined herein), in each case, on or about August 23, 2018. See “Book Entry;**
**Delivery and Form.”**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

We are furnishing this offering circular on a confidential basis in connection with an offering that is
exempt from registration under the Securities Act solely to allow prospective investors to consider the
purchase of the Notes. Delivery of this offering circular to any other person or any reproduction of this
offering circular, in whole or in part, without our or the initial purchasers’ prior consent is prohibited. The
information contained in this offering circular has been provided by us and other sources identified in
this offering circular. We accept responsibility for the information contained in this offering circular. We,
and not the initial purchasers, have ultimate authority over such information, including its content and
whether and how to communicate such information. No representation or warranty, express or implied,
is made by the initial purchasers or the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering circular, and nothing contained
in this offering circular is, or should be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the initial
purchasers or the trustee.

The Notes and note guarantees described in this offering circular have not been registered with,
recommended by or approved by the SEC or any other federal, state or provincial securities
commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such federal, state or provincial securities
commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering circular. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange within a
reasonable period of time after the issue date of such Notes. The listing application will be subject to
approval by the Authority. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on
the Issuer making an application for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. The Exchange is
not a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Neither the
admission of the Euro Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, nor the approval of this
offering circular pursuant to the listing requirements of the Authority shall constitute a warranty or
representation by the Authority as to the competence of the service providers to, or any other party
connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy of information contained in this offering circular or the
suitability of the Issuer for investment or any other purposes.

Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited is acting as listing agent for the Issuer and for no one
else in connection with the listing of the Euro Notes or trading on the Exchange and will not be
responsible to anyone other than the Issuer.

The Dollar Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.

You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the distribution of this
offering circular and the offer or sale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” You are not to construe
the contents of this offering circular as investment, legal or tax advice. You should consult your own
counsel, accountant and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a
purchase of the Notes.

We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making any representation to you regarding the
legality of an investment in the Notes by you under appropriate legal investment or similar laws.

This offering circular is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to “qualified institutional buyers”
as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) for informational use solely in
connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) in offshore transactions
complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Its use

for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering circular may not be copied or reproduced in whole
or in part, nor may it be distributed or any of its contents be disclosed to anyone other than the
prospective investors to whom it is being provided. By accepting delivery, you also acknowledge that
this document contains confidential information and you agree that the use of this information for any
purpose other than considering a purchase of the Notes is strictly prohibited.

In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as indicated in this offering circular under the caption “Transfer
Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be

pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. You should be aware that you may be required to bear
the financial risks of investing in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

This offering circular contains summaries, believed to be accurate, of some of the terms of certain
documents, but reference is made to the actual documents, copies of which will be made available
upon request following their execution and delivery. We do not have any obligation to update or
supplement any information contained in this offering circular or otherwise provide similar information
in the future.

For the complete information contained in those documents, see “Where You Can Find More
Information.” In making an investment decision regarding the Notes offered by this offering circular, you
must rely on your own examination of our company and the terms of the offering, including the merits
and risks involved. The offering is being made on the basis of this offering circular. Any decision to
purchase Notes in the offering must be based on the information contained in this offering circular.

We reserve the right to withdraw the offering of the Notes at any time, and we and the initial
purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part,
and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of the Notes subscribed for by such
investor. We are making this offering subject to the terms described in this offering circular and the
indenture related to the Notes.

The Dollar Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Dollar Notes sold
pursuant to this offering circular will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which
will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and registered in its
name or in the name of Cede & Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be
shown on, and transfers of the global certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by
DTC and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Dollar
Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the
indenture governing the Dollar Notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form.”

The Euro Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Euro Notes sold
pursuant to this offering circular will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which
will be deposited and held by, or on behalf of, and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, or “Euroclear,” and for Clearstream
Banking, société anonyme, or “Clearstream.” Beneficial interests in the global certificates relating to the
Euro Notes will be shown on, and transfers of such global certificates will be effected only through,
records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream and their participants. After the initial issuance of the
global certificates, Euro Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates
only as set forth in the indenture that will govern the Euro Notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form.”

This offering circular does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the
Notes to any person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. For a

iii

further description of certain restrictions on the offer and sale of the Notes, see “Plan of Distribution”
and “Transfer Restrictions.”

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations,
warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” in this offering circular. We are not,
and the initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an
offer or sale is permitted. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of
your investment for an indefinite period of time.

By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you acknowledge that (i) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to
verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering circular, (ii) you have
not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with
the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (iii) this offering
circular relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (iv) no
person has been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this
offering or the Notes described in this offering circular, other than as contained in this offering circular
and information given by our duly authorized officers and employees in connection with an investor’s
examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about
August 23, 2018, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such
settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the
date of pricing or the next succeeding seven (7) business days will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during the period
described above should consult their own advisor.

We make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. You should not
consider any information in this offering circular to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult
your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an
investment in the Notes. You should not assume that the information contained in this offering circular
is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering circular. Neither the
delivery of the offering circular nor any sale made pursuant to this offering circular implies that any
information set forth in this offering circular is correct as of any date after the date of this offering
circular.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect
transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes at a higher level than the Notes
might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at
any time. For a description of these activities, see the section “Plan of Distribution” in this offering
circular.

be measures of cash flow in accordance with GAAP or a reflection of a comprehensive system of
accounting, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax
payments and debt service requirements.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful
supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude certain material
non-cash items and certain other adjustments for items that management and the Board of Directors
do not consider part of core operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, and
for consistency with the manner in which our operating subsidiary, BMC Software Finance Inc., reports
its operating results in its periodic reporting to its lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement.
Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for
greater transparency of supplemental information used by management and the Board of Directors.

We also refer to certain bookings information. Bookings represent the total contract value of
customer transactions closed and recorded by us during the periods presented. Bookings in a given
period are either recognized as revenue in that period or are deferred and recognized as revenue in
future periods. Additionally, we evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and constant

vi

currency basis. Accordingly, we have included certain constant currency metrics that exclude the
effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by applying constant foreign currency
exchange rates to both the current and prior periods. Such exchange rates are primarily USD:EUR of
1.25, USD:GBP of 1.41, INR:USD of 64, BRL:USD of 3.2 and USD:AUD of 0.79. This calculation may
differ from similarly titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency
presentation is not meant to be a substitution for reported amounts presented in conformity with GAAP.

For the definitions of, and additional information about, non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA,
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, a
description of how these non-GAAP financial measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these
non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures or to other
non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable, see the relevant footnotes under “Summary— Summary
Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Data” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this
offering circular.

Our method of calculating non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow on both an as-reported and
constant currency basis may vary from the method used by other companies. In addition, in calculating
these non-GAAP financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and
estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. Our presentation of non-GAAP revenue,
Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free
Cash Flow, which adjust for unusual or nonrecurring items, should not be construed as an inference
that our future results will not be affected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We believe many issuers
of non-investment grade securities also present these or similar non-GAAP financial measures and the
related ratio data because investors, analysts and rating agencies consider them useful in measuring
the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations.

Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider
these items in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of
these limitations are: (i) these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of our cash expenditures,
future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect the
significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt; (iii) they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;
(iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash
requirements for such replacements; (v) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our
working capital needs; (vi) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are
reflected in our statements of cash flows; and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these
measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these
limitations, non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or invest in our business. We
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results, using these non-GAAP
financial measures only for supplemental purposes and by reconciling such non-GAAP financial
measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures or to other non-GAAP financial
measures, as applicable.

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as
non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in
accordance with GAAP. These rules require, among other things:

‰ a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or
measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP;

‰ a quantitative reconciliation for historical non-GAAP measures presented and qualitative
differences between non-GAAP financial measures disclosed with the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP;

‰ a statement disclosing the purposes for which the issuer’s management uses the non-GAAP
financial measure; and

‰ a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation
of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding the
registrant’s financial condition and results of operations.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

‰ exclusion of non-cash charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required
cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity
measures;

‰ adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as
nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is
reasonably likely to recur;

‰ presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or
notes thereto) or any pro forma financial information; and

‰ pro forma adjustments that are not directly attributable to the specific transactions to which pro
forma effect is being given or that are not factually supported or that are not expected to have a
continuing impact.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering circular may not comply with these
rules. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP
financial measures or to other non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable, see “Summary—
Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational
Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INVESTORS**

This offering circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Directive 2003/71/EC (as
amended by Directive 2010/73/EU) (the “Prospectus Directive”).

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the
“EEA”). For the purposes of this provision:

I. a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

a. a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or

b. a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

c. not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive; and

x


-----

II. the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable
an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

Furthermore, this offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the
EEA will only be made to a legal entity which is a qualified investor under the Prospectus Directive.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the EEA of the Notes may only do so
with respect to qualified investors. Neither we nor the initial purchasers have authorized the making of
any offer of Notes other than to qualified investors.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Our Industry**

The ITOM industry is seeing continued growth driven by the challenges facing large enterprises
(cost containment, compliance and evolving business demands / need for continuous optimization) and
several technology trends. These trends include the growing strategic importance of IT, the increasing
complexity of enterprise IT architectures, the increasing challenges enterprises face in managing IT
operations and the persistence of mainframe as a core computing platform. Taken together, these
trends underpin the technology tailwinds driving the growth of integrated ITOM software platforms.

‰ Market Opportunity. We believe that the global ITOM market represented over $25 billion of
spend in 2017 and is expected to grow to over $38 billion of spend in 2022, representing a
compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 7% to 8%. This projected market
growth represents an opportunity for us to expand our services and revenues within the ITOM
market. For additional information, see “Market, Ranking and Other Industry Data.”

‰ Growing Strategic Importance of IT. The global digitization of business has evolved IT from
a supporting function to a core capability for many of today’s leading enterprises. How well a
business can build, deliver and manage IT drives its ability to offer differentiated services and
compete effectively in the global and online business environment. This evolution has elevated
the strategic importance of IT resources in many enterprises and increased the scope of the
digital services such enterprises are expected to deliver and manage.

‰ Increasing Complexity of Enterprise IT Architectures. From mainframe to client-server
architecture to mobile and multi-cloud to Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices, the evolution of new
technologies over the past several decades has expanded the scope of IT. These new
technologies often are being deployed alongside existing infrastructure, necessitating the
inclusion of operations management in almost all IT disciplines to run a secure and performing
business. The compounding complexity of modern IT architectures — coupled with the
proliferation of data and increasing transaction volumes — strains IT resources and requires new
solutions that enable businesses to manage their IT infrastructures securely and efficiently.

‰ Enterprises **_Face_** **_Increasing_** **_Challenges_** **_in_** **_Managing_** **_IT_** **_Operations._** Modern IT
organizations often need to manage disparate types of computing architectures and
deployment models including multi-cloud, hybrid and on-premises. They also must maintain
performance and availability of technology infrastructure to run mission-critical workloads and
dynamically scale IT services to growing business demands. The resulting heterogeneity of
modern IT environments has made managing IT operations a complex task for IT
professionals. Key challenges include:

   - managing increasing complexity of business services running across heterogeneous,
multi-cloud infrastructure;

   - securing the IT infrastructure by tracking compliance to identify, prioritize and remediate
vulnerabilities;

   - containing the total cost of ownership of IT infrastructure;

   - identifying, locating and monitoring all IT assets within complex, multi-cloud
environments;

   - enabling agile software development and IT operations so that organizations can build,
deploy and scale applications at faster speeds; and

   - increasing efficiency, including limiting downtime, accelerating speed of delivering new
services and providing faster incident resolution.

‰ Persistence of Mainframe as a Core Computing Platform. Mainframes are powerful
servers, capable of processing large numbers of transactions simultaneously, while supporting
thousands of applications, users and devices and operating with near perfect uptime. Superior
speed, security and reliability constitute the core value proposition of the mainframe and
differentiate the platform from other IT infrastructures such as distributed networks or cloud.
Transaction processing, data retrieval and records management are among the most missioncritical mainframe workloads.

For many of the world’s largest companies, the mainframe is and will continue to be a critical
part of their IT infrastructure. Data-sensitive industries such as financial services and
governments require the mainframe’s superior security features, and large companies with very
high transaction volumes, such as commercial banks, retailers and airlines, rely on the speed
and reliability of the mainframe. The central role mainframe servers play in modern IT
infrastructure, the risk involved in moving mission critical workloads off the mainframe and the
lack of viable alternatives for key use cases create significant barriers to migrating from the
platform.

Secular trends such as the growth of mobile transactions, proliferation of digital data and
increased connectivity between IT infrastructure and endpoints are creating growth in
mainframe usage. Organizations are expanding their mainframe computing capacity, measured
in millions of instructions per second (“MIPS”) to effectively manage these additional demands.
The global installed base of MIPS has more than doubled over the last 10 years. A third-party
survey found that the majority of mainframe users expect mainframe spend to increase
annually over the next five years.

(2) We present non-GAAP revenue as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define
non-GAAP revenue as revenue, adjusted to exclude the impact of purchase accounting
adjustments to the fair value of deferred revenue as a result of the 2013 Acquisition (as defined
herein) that we do not consider indicative of our operating performance.

We also present Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental
measures of our performance. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as net income (loss) before
(i) other expense (net), (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iii) depreciation and
amortization expenses, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items (including the
removal of certain purchase accounting adjustments) that we do not consider indicative of our
ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP EBITDA
to add back interest income on financed receivables and non-income tax expense. Our
presentation of Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and
analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by
excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our
core operating results when assessing the performance of the Company. In addition, we use
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA because the Existing Credit Facilities and existing indentures
governing our Existing Notes use measures, and the new Credit Facilities and the indenture
governing the Notes will use measures, similar to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to measure
compliance with certain covenants.

While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental
information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a
comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between
companies. Items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material
impact on net income (loss). Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow
from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For
further detail, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and footnote (5) under “—Summary Historical
Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Data.”

Our total bookings increased to approximately $284.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018
from $257.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. In addition, each of the Enterprise Solutions
Organization (“ESO”) bookings and ZSolutions bookings increased by double-digits for the quarter
ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

(2) Represents adjustment to apply constant foreign currency exchange rates to current and prior
periods.

(3) Represents estimated cost savings anticipated to be achieved during the fiscal year 2019 from
reductions in headcount employee-related costs that have already been implemented or initiated
on or before May 2018 and which had been planned independent of the Merger. These cost
savings are part of and not separate from our estimated $45.0 million of actioned cost savings.
See footnote (5)(m) under “—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Financial and Operational Data.”

The calculation of estimated benefits from these cost savings initiatives is an estimation of
benefits expected to be achieved in the future and based on assumptions and estimates
regarding our future results and therefore is necessarily speculative. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to attain these costs savings. Also, the pro forma adjustment to reflect these cost
savings may not be permitted in an SEC filing because it is not permitted by Article 11 of
Regulation S-X or otherwise. Additionally, we may be unable to realize all of these costs savings
within the timeframe expected, or at all, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in
order to realize them. See “Risk Factors—We may not achieve all of the expected cost savings
included in Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”

(4) Represents Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA presented in constant currency, further adjusted to give
effect to actioned cost savings indicated above.

**_Cautionary Statement Regarding Preliminary Results_**

Our estimated preliminary non-GAAP results presented above for the quarter and twelve months
ended June 30, 2018 are unaudited, unreviewed and subject to completion. Such estimated results
reflect management’s current views and may change as a result of management’s review of results
and other factors, including a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and
uncertainties. Such preliminary results are subject to the closing of the quarter and finalization of
accounting procedures, and should not be viewed as a substitute for full quarterly financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance upon these
preliminary financial results. We further caution you that these estimates are forward-looking
statements and are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual results may
differ materially from the estimates described above. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
from those described above are set forth in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement about Forward
Looking Statements.”

In addition, the preliminary financial results presented above have not been audited or reviewed
by our independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP. Accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto and assumes no responsibility for, and
disclaims any association with, this information.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Merger**

Effective May 25, 2018, Boxer Parent Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Merger Agreement”) with Parent, Merger Sub and the Representative, pursuant to which, at the
closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, Parent, via Merger Sub, will acquire Boxer Parent
Company and Merger Sub will be merged with and into Boxer Parent Company with Boxer Parent
Company surviving the merger (the “Merger”).

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Boxer Parent Company’s common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain shares of common stock subject
to customary exceptions), and all vested and outstanding options to acquire Boxer Parent Company’s
common stock, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive cash consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Certain
members of Boxer Parent Company’s management may agree to “roll over” a percentage of their
ownership of Boxer Parent Company’s common stock into Parent’s common stock. The aggregate
purchase price for the Company’s outstanding equity will be based on a base merger consideration of
$8,300.0 million in cash, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the Company,
customary representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub and customary covenants and
other agreements among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. The closing of the Merger is subject
to (i) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, (ii) the expiration of all applicable waiting periods or receipt of required approvals
under the foreign competition laws (or other laws) identified by the parties in certain specified
jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any law or order by any governmental body prohibiting the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iv) other customary closing
conditions.

Either Boxer Parent Company or Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the
closing:

‰ by mutual written consent;

‰ if any government authority issues a law or any final and non-appealable order enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(provided no termination may be made by a party whose breach of the Merger Agreement has
primarily resulted in or caused such law or order);

‰ if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have not been consummated on or
before November 26, 2018; provided that the party seeking termination has not been a primary
cause thereof and; provided further that this initial end date shall be extended to February 26,
2019 at the election of either Boxer Parent Company or Parent if, as of November 26, 2018, (A)
all of the closing conditions have been met (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the closing) but the marketing period has not been completed (or the second
business day following the completion of the marketing period has not occurred) or (B) all of the
closing conditions have been met, other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing and other than the closing conditions described in clauses (i) or (ii) in the immediately
preceding paragraph or the closing condition described in clause (iii) in the immediately
preceding paragraph as it relates to the conditions described in clauses (i) or (ii) in the
immediately preceding paragraph); or

‰ upon the uncured breach or failure to perform of the other party in certain circumstances.


14


-----

In addition, Boxer Parent Company may terminate the Merger Agreement in certain
circumstances if all closing conditions (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing provided such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the closing) have been satisfied or
waived and Parent fails to consummate the Merger within three business days of the date the closing
is required to occur under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances, Parent may be required to pay a termination fee to Boxer Parent Company.

Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will be a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Parent. All of Parent’s outstanding capital stock will be owned by entities affiliated with KKR, other than
(i) any capital stock or options issued to management in connection with their “rollover” of equity of
Boxer Parent Company or otherwise granted in connection with Parent’s management equity plans
and (ii) any PIK Preferred Equity held by investors unaffiliated with KKR. Parent will use the cash
contributed by entities affiliated with KKR and the Rollover Offer Participants (collectively, the “Sponsor
Equity Contribution”), cash on hand, the net proceeds of the PIK Preferred Equity contribution,
borrowings under the Credit Facilities and the net proceeds from this offering of Notes to pay the
Merger consideration under the Merger Agreement, repay certain existing indebtedness, pay related
fees and expenses and fund cash to the balance sheet.

For a more complete description of the Merger, see “The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

**The Financing Transactions**

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we anticipate the following will occur (the “Financing
Transactions”):

‰ the entry into the Credit Facilities, including: (i) the $400.0 million Revolving Credit Facility;
(ii) the USD Term Loan Facility (all $3,300.0 million of which will be borrowed to finance the
Merger); and (iii) the €930.0 million Euro Term Loan Facility (all €930.0 million of which will be
borrowed to finance the Merger);

‰ the release from escrow of the gross proceeds of the $1,475.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Dollar Notes and €301.5 million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes offered
hereby;

‰ the contribution by Parent to Merger Sub of the net proceeds received by it from the issuance
by Parent of PIK Preferred Equity in an aggregate amount of $300.0 million to affiliates of the
Sponsor and/or other investors that commit to purchase a portion of PIK Preferred Equity; and

‰ the Sponsor Equity Contribution committed to be made to Parent by the Sponsor and the
Rollover Offer Participants of $2,100.0 million, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger.

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will
execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross
proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes into the applicable Escrow Account. The release of
escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the
Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, and upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the
purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance


15


-----

with the procedures set forth herein. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue
date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in
respect of interest that would accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes
will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and
its affiliates will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a
special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that
are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory
redemption and the special mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” We will repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing
Credit Facilities and discharge or defease the Existing Notes on the date we consummate the Merger.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

The consummation of the Merger and related transactions, the repayment of the Existing Credit
Facilities, the discharge or defeasance of the Existing Notes, the payment of related fees and
expenses and the Financing Transactions are referred to collectively in this offering circular as the
“Transactions.” For a more detailed description of the Transactions, see “The Transactions.”

For a more detailed description of the Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness,” and for a more detailed description of the Notes offered hereby, see “Description of
Notes.”

closing date to fund the Merger. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to
$400 million from time to time and includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit. The Credit
Facilities will permit us to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility an amount up to $50 million to
finance the Merger plus additional amounts to fund original issue discount (“OID”) or upfront fees.
See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” We do not currently intend to draw any of the
$50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so
as a result of a decline in cash on the balance sheet on or after the closing date, to fund
additional fees or expenses or for other reasons. Euro proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility
will be swapped for U.S. dollars on the closing date of the Merger, pursuant to certain foreign
currency forward contracts.
(2) Represents the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered
hereby, consisting of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes, excluding any discounts and
commissions.
(3) Represents cash equity contributions associated with the issuance by Parent of $300 million of
PIK Preferred Equity, excluding issuance costs, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—PIK
Preferred Equity.”
(4) Represents cash equity contributions committed to be made by the Sponsor and the Rollover
Offer Participants to Parent, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in connection with the
Merger. See “The Transactions—The Merger.”
(5) Reflects (i) the estimate of the total consideration to be paid for the purchase of the Company’s
issued and outstanding common shares (other than the rollover equity of the Rollover Offer
Participants), (ii) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions of
approximately $170 million, not including the fees and expenses described in footnote (7) below,
and (iii) the repayment of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, including the third-party
indebtedness and all premiums, fees and expenses therewith. The actual purchase price of the
Company’s equity will depend on the adjustments to the Merger consideration immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger. See “The Transactions—The Merger.”

In connection with the Transactions, we intend to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under
the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain stock repurchase promissory notes. As
of March 31, 2018, we had the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3,603 million aggregate
principal amount in outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities, approximately
$1,840 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes outstanding and approximately
$7 million of stock repurchase promissory notes outstanding. In connection with our repayment of
outstanding indebtedness, we intend to pay a premium for the redemption of and accrued interest
on the Existing Notes and such stock repurchase promissory notes, which totals approximately
$89 million as of March 31, 2018. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Transactions, the
borrowings and accrued interest associated with the existing indebtedness may vary. Affiliates of
certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes are lenders and/or agents under the Existing Credit
Facilities and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering through the
repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities if such funds are
released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger. See “Plan of Distribution.”

As of March 31, 2018, we also had the following indebtedness outstanding: (i) $304 million
aggregate principal amount of 9.000% / 9.750% senior contingent cash pay notes due
October 14, 2019 (the “Existing PIK Notes”), which were fully redeemed during the quarter ended
June 30, 2018, and (ii) derivative instruments, (x) certain of which were terminated during the
quarter ended June 30, 2018 and (y) the remainder of which will mature prior to the
consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, such indebtedness will not be repaid in connection

with the Transactions, but will impact our cash and cash equivalents on a pro forma basis. See
“Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”
(6) Reflects (i) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Financing Transactions of
$222 million, including placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other
financing fees, our estimate of OID, and other transaction costs for advisory and professional
fees, and (ii) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the remainder of the Transactions
of $68 million, including PIK Preferred Equity issuance costs, fees paid to the Sponsor and other
transaction costs for advisory and professional fees. All fees, expenses and other costs are
estimates and actual amounts may differ from those set forth in this offering circular.

transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately
$483.8 million, or 49.0%, of our total revenue, and approximately $451.2 million, or 55.4%, of our
Non-GAAP EBITDA, in each case, for the year ended March 31, 2018. Excluding the effect of
intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for
approximately $3,778.1 million, or 35.8%, of our consolidated total assets, and approximately
$1,125.1 million, or 13.6%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case, as of March 31, 2018.

for such taxes is required by law with respect to a payment to
holders of the Euro Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the
Issuer will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net
amount received after the withholding or deductions is not less
than the amount that would have been received in the absence
of such withholding or deductions. See “Description of Notes—
Payment of Additional Amounts on the Euro Notes.”

additional amounts with respect to the Euro Notes as a result of
certain changes in tax laws, it may redeem the Euro Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to but
excluding the date of such redemption. See “Description of
Notes—Redemption of Euro Notes for Tax Reasons.”

Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . . If a Change of Control (as defined in “Description of Notes”)
occurs, we must offer to repurchase the Notes then outstanding
at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture that will govern the Notes will contain covenants
that, among other things, will limit our ability and the ability of
our restricted subsidiaries to:

‰ incur additional indebtedness;

‰ pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or
repurchase or redeem our capital stock;

‰ prepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness;

‰ create certain liens;

‰ sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

‰ create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting
subsidiaries;

‰ engage in transactions with affiliates;

‰ create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

‰ consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our
assets or the assets of our subsidiaries.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications as described under “Description of Notes—
Certain Covenants.” In addition, many of these covenants will
cease to apply with respect to a series of the Notes during any
time that such series of Notes have investment grade ratings
from any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”),
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Fitch Inc.
(“Fitch”) and no default with respect to the Notes has occurred
and is continuing. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Effectiveness of Covenants.”

Transfer Restrictions; No
Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the note guarantees have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws,
and we are under no obligation to so register the Notes. The
Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, except that holders will not be permitted to
transfer the Notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the
applicable holding period has been satisfied. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

We do not intend to issue registered Notes and note
guarantees in exchange for the Notes and the note guarantees
to be placed in this offering, and the absence of registration
rights may adversely impact the transferability of the Notes.
See “Notice to Investors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
the Notes and our Indebtedness—We do not intend to offer to
register the Notes or to exchange the Notes in a registered
exchange offer.”

Use of Proceeds. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the
contribution to us by Parent of the net proceeds of Parent’s
offering of PIK Preferred Equity, together with borrowings under

on hand to fund the Merger consideration, to retire certain
existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related fees
and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Each series of Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although certain of the initial purchasers
have informed us that they intend to make a market in each
series of Notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may
discontinue market making activities at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
Notes will develop or, if such a market develops, that it will be
maintained. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes
and Our Indebtedness—Your ability to transfer the Notes may
be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an
active trading market for the Notes may not develop.”

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED**
**FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA**

The following tables set forth our summary historical consolidated and pro forma condensed
consolidated financial and operational data for the periods and as of the dates indicated. The summary
historical consolidated and pro forma condensed consolidated financial data presented below for each
of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2018, and as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 have
been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
circular. The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2016 has been
derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included in this offering circular. The
summary historical consolidated financial data as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015 has been
derived from our unaudited consolidated financial information not included in this offering circular. Such
2015 financial information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. Our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular do not reflect the impact
of the Transactions.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the
year ended March 31, 2018 have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give pro forma effect to the
consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2017 and the unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data have been derived from our unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give effect
to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2018. The pro forma adjustments are based
upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The actual
adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend
on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing
date of the Transactions. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax
structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the
pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our
financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates
noted above or to project the results for any future date or period.

The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma
adjustments reflected in our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering circular (and from which the summary unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial data set forth in the tables below have been derived) reflect
adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and are based upon, among other
things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair
market value may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities
and stockholders’ equity, revenue, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income
taxes and other items of income and expense. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial
statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional
information available and our actual assets and liabilities on the closing date. Therefore, the actual
adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data do not reflect any
non-recurring charges or gains that we may record in connection with the Merger. However, these
estimated non-recurring items will be reflected in our statement of operations for the period during
which the Merger will take place.

2016, 2017 and 2018, increased perpetual license revenue by $47.8 million, $22.1 million,
$9.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively; perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue by
$165.8 million, $72.8 million, $27.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively; term license and
maintenance revenue by $216.7 million, $137.4 million, $86.3 million and $44.2 million, respectively;
professional services revenue by $7.6 million, $1.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively;
and total revenue by $437.9 million, $233.5 million, $124.4 million and $66.6 million, respectively.
The pro forma amounts for the year ended March 31, 2018 also exclude the effects of estimated
purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the Merger, which further increase pro forma
perpetual license revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $98.7 million, pro forma perpetual maintenance and
SaaS revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $422.2 million, pro forma term license and maintenance
revenue by $323.7 million and pro forma professional services revenue by $17.7 million. Such pro
forma adjustments for purchase accounting are estimates and such estimates may prove to be
inaccurate. Therefore, the actual adjustments may differ from the estimated pro forma adjustments,
and the differences may be material. For additional information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

We also present Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA
as net income (loss) before (i) other expense (net), (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes and
(iii) depreciation and amortization expenses, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain
items (including the removal of certain purchase accounting adjustments) that we do not consider
indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts
Non-GAAP EBITDA to add back interest income on financed receivables, non-income tax
expense and, for the fiscal years 2016 and prior, to normalize the effects of capitalized software
development costs to a constant capitalization of $28.9 million per year. Pro Forma Non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to actioned cost
savings, as described in the footnotes below. These further adjustments are itemized below. You
are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for
supplemental analysis. In evaluating Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur
expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our
presentation of Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be
affected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and
analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by
excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our
core operating results when assessing the performance of the Company. In addition, we use
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA because the Existing Credit Facilities and existing indentures
governing our Existing Notes use measures, and the new Credit Facilities and the indenture
governing the Notes will use measures, similar to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants.

While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental
information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a
comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between
companies. Items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material
impact on net income (loss). In addition, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA reflects

Company’s adoption of new accounting standards, professional fees associated with a potential
transaction and non-cash adjustments to estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition.
(d) Represents amounts paid to the affiliates of Bain Capital Private Equity, LP, Golden Gate Private
Equity, Inc., Insight Venture Management, LLC and a company affiliated with GIC (Ventures) Pte. Ltd.
(the “Existing Sponsors”) pursuant to the terms of an advisory and payment agreement (the “Existing
Sponsor Advisory Agreement”) that will be terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger.
Accordingly, following the termination fee payable in connection with the Merger, no additional sponsor
management fee will be payable under the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. However, we will be
required to pay certain sponsor management fees to KKR in the future, which may be greater than the
sponsor management fees pursuant to the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. For additional
information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
(e) Represents third-party legal fees and other costs incurred to protect the Company’s intellectual property.
(f) Represents proceeds received as a result of the confidential settlement agreement entered into during
the year ended March 31, 2017 with ServiceNow, Inc. to resolve the patent infringement litigation, net
of contingent third-party legal fees incurred.
(g) Represents legal, settlement and related costs associated with specific matters that the Company
does not consider part of its core operations or operating results.
(h) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense
associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the
Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the
2013 Acquisition. This adjustment related to deferred costs and other expenses for fiscal years 2015,
2016, 2017 and 2018 excludes $91.3 million, $61.6 million, $30.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively,
of non-GAAP amortization expense related to the pre-2013 Acquisition capitalization of software
development costs for internally developed products that would have been recognized in these
periods, which has no impact on EBITDA.
(i) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense
associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the
Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the
Merger.
(j) Represents excluded operating expense associated with certain executive severance costs.
(k) Represents an adjustment to normalize the impact of capitalized software development costs in fiscal
years 2016 and 2015 to a constant capitalization amount of $28.9 million annually.
(l) Represents adjustment to apply constant foreign currency exchange rates to current and prior periods.
(m) Represents estimated cost savings anticipated to be achieved during the fiscal year 2019 from
reductions in headcount and employee-related costs that have already been implemented or initiated
on or before May 2018 and which had been planned independent of the Merger, and include
estimated cost savings of approximately (i) $3.0 million associated with the continued reduction in
costs in non-strategic products; (ii) $9.0 million related to reduced investment in mature products,
improved span of control and continued transition to lower-cost development locations; (iii)
$20.0 million associated with ESO, including reductions in both support functions spend and direct
investment in underperforming geographies, as well as improvement in span of control; (iv)
$3.0 million in ESO customer success organization and actions within smaller ESO organizations; (v)
$1.0 million related to moving more headcount to lower-cost offshore locations; (vi) $4.0 million related
to transitioning North America and Latin America headcount to lower-cost locations; and (vii)
$5.0 million related to the reduction in G&A headcount primarily within human resources and IT, with
some IT headcount moving to India.

We have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $17 million through March 31, 2018, and expect
to incur approximately $6 million in additional costs in fiscal year 2019, to achieve these cost savings.
None of these $23 million in restructuring costs are netted from our actioned cost savings adjustment
or otherwise have reduced our Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein.

The calculation of estimated benefits from these cost savings initiatives is an estimation of benefits
expected to be achieved in the future and based on assumptions and estimates regarding our future
results and therefore is necessarily speculative. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attain
these costs savings. Also, the pro forma adjustment to reflect these cost savings may not be permitted
in an SEC filing because it is not permitted by Article 11 of Regulation S-X or otherwise. Additionally,
we may be unable to realize all of these costs savings within the timeframe expected, or at all, and we
may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them. See “Risk Factors—We may
not achieve all of the expected cost savings included in Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”

(6) The ratio of Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest expense is determined by dividing
Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA by pro forma interest expense. In calculating interest expense for
purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering

-----

circular, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest rates that would apply to each series
of Notes and the Credit Facilities and other obligations we will incur at the closing of the Merger. These
adjustments are set forth in “Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.” The actual
interest rates on the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions may differ materially. Actual interest
expense may be higher than pro forma interest expense shown in this offering circular.
(7) The ratio of pro forma total net secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by
dividing pro forma total net secured debt of $3,818.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of
$869.4 million. Our pro forma total net secured debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million,
the Euro Term Loan Facility of €930.0 million and $17.2 million of other secured debt. Pro forma total net
secured debt is defined as pro forma total secured debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to “Capitalization,” we anticipate that our actual cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected in
“Capitalization” on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million, not the
amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018. If we
calculated our pro forma total net secured debt as our pro forma total secured debt less such estimated
$62.0 million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in “Capitalization,” our pro forma total net
secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 5.0x.
(8) The ratio of pro forma total net debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing
pro forma total net debt of $5,643.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $869.4 million.
Our pro forma total net debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million, Euro Term Loan
Facility of €930.0 million, $1,825.0 million equivalent of the Notes offered hereby and $17.2 million of other
debt. Pro forma total net debt is defined as pro forma total debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to “Capitalization,” we anticipate that our actual cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount
reflected in “Capitalization” on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0
million, not the amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31,
2018. If we calculated our pro forma total net debt as our pro forma total debt less such estimated $62.0
million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in “Capitalization,” our pro forma total net debt
to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 7.1x.
(9) We define Free Cash Flow as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted for the items included below, which is
also derivable from cash flows from operating activities, less cash paid for purchases of property, equipment and
capitalized software development costs, as well as the proceeds from patent litigation settlement, plus payments
for interest, income taxes, share-based awards, certain merger-related costs, hurricane relief contributions and
sponsor management fees. See below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow.

We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it assists investors and analysts in
comparing our liquidity across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management
and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our core operating cash flow results when
assessing the performance of the Company.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors, together with all of the information_
_set forth in this offering circular, before deciding to invest in the Notes. The risks and uncertainties_
_described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware_
_of, or those we currently deem immaterial, may also become important and material factors that affect_
_us. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial_
_condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you could lose_
_all or part of your original investment._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_Competition from large, powerful multi-line and small, agile single-line competitors could_**
**_have a negative impact on our business and financial results._**

Some of our largest competitors, including IBM, CA and HPE/MicroFocus, have significant scale
advantages. With scale comes a large installed base of customers in particular market niches, as well
as the ability to develop and market software that is competitive with ours. Some of these competitors
can also bundle hardware, software and services together, which is a disadvantage for us, because we
are not a hardware provider and have fewer services offerings. Competitive products are also offered
by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly
fragmented software industry. Some, like Microsoft, Oracle and VMWare, are the leading developers
and vendors in their specialized markets and others, like ServiceNow and Compuware, have recently
gained significant market share in some areas in which we have product offerings. In addition, new
companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis, offering products that compete with some
individual products offered by us. Market entrants utilizing alternative business models such as SaaS,
cloud computing or open source software also compete against us. As the use of open source software
becomes more widespread, certain open source technology could become competitive with our
proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the
fees we charge for our products. Other data center vendors may expand into systems management to
complement their existing offerings. Additionally, many customers historically have developed their
own products that compete with those offered by us. Competition from any of these sources can result
in price reductions or displacement of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Our cloud and SaaS offerings bring business and operational risks._**

We have introduced multiple new products and technology initiatives to provide systems
management solutions in the emerging area of cloud computing. We include in this category our SaaS
offerings. Our SaaS offerings provide our customers with existing and new software management
through a hosted service as opposed to traditional software deployments. There can be no assurance
that SaaS revenue will be significant in the future despite our levels of investment. There is a risk that
our SaaS offerings may reduce demand for licenses and maintenance of our traditional software
products, which could impact our revenue. Additionally, margins associated with our SaaS offerings
are generally lower than margins associated with our on-premises solutions. A large portion of our
revenue is generated from the renewal of existing customer contracts, the rate of which is uncertain
and may decline or fluctuate in the future. Our SaaS contracts typically contain non-cancelable
subscription terms of one to several years, after which the contracts are generally renewable at a
customer’s option, and there are generally no obligations to license additional software or subscribe for
additional services. This inherent uncertainty surrounding the renewal of our customer contracts, and
the date of any such renewals, impacts when the combination of revenue and changes in deferred

40


-----

revenue in a given period are recorded and creates volatility in our quarterly results. Our customers
may not renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription agreements and in fact,
some customers elect not to do so. In addition, our customers may opt for a lower-priced edition of our
offerings or for fewer subscriptions. We have limited data with respect to rates of customer subscription
renewals, in particular for our newer offerings, so we may not be able to accurately predict customer
renewal rates. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of
factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services and their ability to continue their operations
and spending levels. If we experience a decline in the renewal rates for our customers or they opt for
lower-priced editions of our offerings or fewer subscriptions, our operating results may be adversely
impacted. There is also a risk that our internal development and customer support teams could find it
difficult or costly to support both traditional software installed by customers and SaaS. To the extent
that our new SaaS offerings are defective or there are disruptions to our services, demand for our
SaaS offerings could diminish and we could be subject to substantial liability. In addition, interruptions
or delays in service from our third-party service delivery hosting vendors could impair the delivery of
our services and harm our business. Further, if we or our third-party service delivery hosting vendors
experience security breaches and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data,
our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services
and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.

Our success in the emerging area of cloud computing depends on organizations and customers
perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with the increasing
adoption of virtual infrastructure solutions for on-premises data centers as well as for cloud computing
and end-user computing. Concerns about security, privacy, availability, data integrity, retention and
ownership may negatively impact the rate of adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing
environments are complex and the deployment of our systems management solutions in the cloud may
require additional professional services and implementation services which we may not have the ability
to provide at an appropriate margin. In the cloud, our products are dependent upon third-party
hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, all of which must interoperate for end users to achieve
their computing goals. As the cloud computing market continues to develop, we expect other
companies to enter this market and to introduce their own initiatives that may compete with, or not be
compatible with, our cloud solutions. Additionally, operating margins on our new initiatives may be
lower than those we have achieved in our more mature product markets, and our new initiatives may
not generate sufficient revenue to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to
occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may not attract new customers and meet our growth and productivity objectives under_**
**_our new business opportunities in the cloud and SaaS space._**

On an ongoing basis, we strive for greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost efficiency by
transforming and globally integrating our own business processes, functions and technologies to
remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more
established markets. These various initiatives, including those taken in connection with our cloud and
SaaS offerings, might not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of
rapid scaling. New client adoption rates, and the renewal and adoption by our existing customers of
additional services and products, and viable economic models are also less certain in these high-value,
highly competitive and growing verticals, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand
and profitability for our other products or services. These challenges may impact our competitiveness
and our ability to meet growth and productivity objectives.

41


-----

**_If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving_**
**_technological and market developments, our competitive position and business prospects_**
**_may be harmed._**

The markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly, and the pace of innovation will continue
to accelerate, as cloud, mobile, workflow, consumer product-like user experiences, social,
collaboration, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet connected devices, robotic automation,
security, cryptography, development tools and other digital technologies increasingly become the basis
for customer purchases. At the same time, our customers and prospective customers are facing their
own competitive imperatives to adopt digital technologies, resulting in the ongoing disruption of almost
every sector of the global economy. Accordingly, to compete effectively in our rapidly changing
markets, we must: identify and invest in the right emerging technologies and select them from the
many technologies in which we could make investments; accurately predict our customers’ changing
business needs; successfully deliver new platform technologies and products that meet these business
needs; efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments; profitably
market and sell new products in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience;
and effectively deliver, either directly or through our ecosystem of partners, the business process
planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers
require to be successful. If we fail to meet any of these requirements, our competitive position and
business prospects may be harmed.

**_Our revenues, operating results and quarterly cash flow are likely to fluctuate, which could_**
**_materially impact our business._**

We experience significant fluctuations in revenues, operating results and quarterly cash flow
caused by many factors, including:

‰ changes in the demand for our software products and services and for the products and
services of our competitors;

‰ reliance on bookings information, or the total value of customer transactions closed and
recorded;

‰ market acceptance of our software products, enhancements and/or services;

‰ lengthening sales cycles and timing of renewals;

‰ delays in the introduction of software products, enhancements and/or services;

‰ a reduction in the size of transactions;

‰ a significant shift from multi-year committed contracts to short-term contracts;

‰ a reduced ability to transfer finance receivables to third parties;

‰ reduced yields on investments and cash equivalents.

A general weakening of the global economy or a continued weakening of the economy in a
particular region or economic or business uncertainty could harm the financial viability of our customers
and resellers, and could result in the cancellation of or delay in customer purchases. A cancellation or
deferral of even a small number of license sales or services or delays in the implementation of our
software products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. As a result of the timing of software product and service introductions and the rapid evolution
of our business, as well as of the markets we serve, we cannot predict whether patterns or trends
experienced in the past will continue. For these reasons, you should not rely upon period-to-period
comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance. Our revenues, operating results
and quarterly cash flow may vary significantly.

**_Our sales cycles can be unpredictable, our revenue depends on customer renewal rates and_**
**_our sales efforts require substantial resources._**

The timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the
unpredictability of the sales cycle, particularly with respect to large organizations. Also, our revenue is
cyclical and is dependent on our customer renewal cycles and renewal rates, which may decline or
fluctuate in the future. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important
that our customers renew their licenses, subscriptions or maintenance when existing contract terms
expire. Our customers have no obligation to renew their contracts after the expiration of their
contractual period and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew.
Our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and
value proposition of the systems and applications that our products support. Customers often view
these commitments as significant strategic decisions and, as a result, may require time to evaluate,
test and qualify our solutions prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us.

Our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, focusing on account
penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. We spend substantial time
and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. Platform
purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated
administrative, processing and other delays. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a
sale will be completed and when revenue from a sale will be recognized.

A significant portion of our sales is to large enterprises. Sales to larger customers involve risks
that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller customers, which
can act as a disincentive to our sales team to pursue these larger customers. These risks include:

‰ competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises and that may have
pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers;

43


-----

‰ increased purchasing power and leverage held by larger customers in negotiating contractual
arrangements with us;

‰ more stringent requirements in our support obligations; and

‰ the risk that substantial resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to
purchase our solutions.

The failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a sales process could
materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.

**_Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability._**

Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no
comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:

‰ general economic and business conditions;

‰ the overall demand for software and services;

‰ governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and

‰ general political developments.

Macroeconomic developments such as recessions in the U.S. and Europe and debt crises in
certain countries in the European Union (the “EU”) or trade wars could negatively affect our business,
operating results or financial condition. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate
confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause
current or potential customers to reduce their IT budgets or be unable to fund software and services
purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and
services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and
services.

In addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, terrorist attacks around the globe and
the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural
disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.

**_Maintenance revenue could decline, and our success depends on customers renewing or_**
**_increasing the scope of their maintenance agreements with us._**

Maintenance revenue is an important source of recurring revenue, and we invest significant
resources to provide maintenance and support services to our customers. A large portion of our
maintenance revenue is generated by our customers’ renewal of their existing maintenance
agreements. Additionally, we try to sell additional services to our customers at the time of renewal.
Maintenance agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option and/or subject to cancellation
rights, and there are generally no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to increase the scope
of one’s maintenance agreement or subscribe for additional services. This inherent uncertainty
surrounding the renewal of contracts and ability to grow maintenance revenue by increasing the scope
of these agreements at the time of renewal impacts the volatility in our operating results. Maintenance
fees generally increase as the licensed capacity increases. Consequently, we generally receive higher
overall maintenance fees with new license and maintenance agreements and as existing customers
license our products for additional processing capacity. Price competition on enterprise transactions
can lead to increased discounting for higher levels of supplemental processing capacity. The

44


-----

maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license
agreements. In addition, customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance fees for
entering into long-term maintenance contracts. Declines in our license bookings, increases in the
proportion of long-term maintenance contracts and/or increased discounting could lead to declines in
our maintenance revenue and corresponding growth rates.

Should customers migrate from systems and applications that our products support, utilize
alternatives to our products, including maintenance-free solutions such as on-demand, or become
dissatisfied with our maintenance services, such customers may cancel their agreements or be less
likely to invest in additional solutions from us in the future, which could lead to declines in our
maintenance revenue. We may not be able to adjust our expense levels quickly enough to account for
any such revenue losses. As maintenance revenue makes up a substantial portion of our total
revenue, any failure of our customers to renew or increase the scope of their new maintenance
agreements might result in a decline in our maintenance revenue, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Risks associated with our professional services business could impact our business results._**

There are a number of risks associated with our professional services business, which could
impact our ability to deliver high quality services and which could impact our business results. These
include the availability of and our ability to engage quality labor resources, both as employees and as
third-party contractors, incremental costs associated with third-party contractors, the complexity of
services engagements, contractual risks, pricing and bidding risks and potential cost overruns. If we
are not able to effectively manage our professional services business, it could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation and our operating results, including our profit margin.

**_Industry consolidation could affect prices or demand for our products._**

The IT industry and the market for our systems management products are very competitive due
to a variety of factors. As the enterprise systems software market matures, it is consolidating. This
trend could create opportunities for larger companies, such as IBM, HPE/MicroFocus, Microsoft,
Oracle and other large enterprise software and hardware companies, to increase their market share
through the acquisition of companies that are strong in certain lucrative market niches or that have
loyal installed customer bases. In doing so, these competitors may be able to reduce prices on
software that competes with our solutions, in part by leveraging their larger economies of scale.
Consolidation also may permit competitors to offer a broader suite of products and more
comprehensive bundled solutions, including hardware, software and services. We expect this trend
towards consolidation to continue as companies attempt to maintain or extend their market and
competitive positions in the rapidly changing software industry and as companies are acquired or are
unable to continue operations. This industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are
better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our
operating results due to lengthening of the customer evaluation process, increased pricing pressure
and/or loss of business to these larger competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_We are subject to risks related to our business combinations and restructuring actions._**

As part of our overall strategy, we have acquired or invested in, and intend to continue to acquire
or invest in, complementary companies, products and technologies. Our ability to realize the benefits
we anticipate from our mergers and acquisitions activities, including anticipated cost savings, may be
adversely impacted by the following:

‰ we may not retain and integrate key technical, sales and managerial personnel;

45


-----

‰ we may not assimilate the personnel, culture and operations of the combined companies,
including back-office functions and systems, such as accounting, human resources and others,
into our own back-office functions and systems;

‰ we may suffer unanticipated expenses or not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or
products with our current products and technologies;

‰ our ongoing business could be disrupted, including management being distracted from other
objectives, opportunities and risks;

‰ we may not achieve the expected benefits or maximize our financial and strategic position
through the successful integration of acquired businesses;

‰ our policies, procedures and controls may not be applied to the acquired entity in a timely
manner following the acquisition;

‰ relationships with the acquired entity’s customers, partners or vendors might degrade, creating
challenges for us to meet the objectives of the acquisition;

‰ potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired entity’s customers;

‰ our pre-acquisition due diligence may fail to identify technology issues, such as problems with
software code, architecture or functionality, intellectual property ownership issues, employment
or management issues, customer or partner issues, errors or irregularities in the accounting or
financial reporting of the target, unknown liabilities of the target, legal contingencies,
compliance failures or other issues;

‰ revenue from acquired companies, products and technologies may not meet our expectations;

‰ our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash;

‰ potential adverse tax consequences;

‰ in the case of foreign acquisitions, we may encounter challenges associated with lingering
operations across different cultures and languages and may experience currency and
regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and

‰ our chosen strategy leading to the acquisition may not be the appropriate strategy or our
resources may be better utilized developing technology via internal product development.

In order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, the products of
these entities must be integrated with our existing products and strategies. These integrations can be
difficult and unpredictable, especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is
typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our products. The
difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well-established because compatibility with
the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires
coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and
unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and
product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration
efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits and cost savings of our mergers and acquisitions
activities.

In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically
realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses. Any
decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of
special charges, such as technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs or charges relating to
consolidation of excess facilities. We may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result
of various factors, including integration and collaboration challenges, such as personnel and

46


-----

technology. Restructuring actions may also give rise to reputational risk, or such actions may not
achieve anticipated cost savings and may result in lower margin rates. Challenges related to our ability
to successfully undertake any future restructuring actions could result in a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Our products must remain compatible with ever-changing operating and database_**
**_environments._**

IBM, HPE/MicroFocus, Microsoft and Oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems
management and database software and, in some cases, are the manufacturers of the computer
hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, operating and database system
developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, database systems, systems software
and computer hardware. Such new products could incorporate features that perform functions currently
performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain
compatibility with these companies’ hardware or software. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and
operating and database system software developers. Operating and database system software
developers have in the past provided us with early access to versions of their software, before making
such software generally available, to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt
our software to exploit new functionality in these systems. Some companies, however, may adopt more
restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These
restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the
enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Failure
to adapt our products in a timely manner to changes in operating and database systems, or any
product quality and performance issues with the underlying databases or operating systems resulting
in degradation of our products’ quality and performance, could influence customer decisions to forego
the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality offered by competitors, which
could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash
flows.

**_Disruption, discovery of errors in or risks related to our software solutions could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

The software solutions we offer are inherently complex and are designed to manage, monitor,
automate and secure mission-critical IT workloads across multi-cloud, hybrid and mainframe
environments. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in
current versions, new versions or enhancements of our software solutions after commencement of
commercial delivery. If new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require
significant amounts of customer support, our operating margins could be harmed. In addition, any
disruptions, discovery of errors, risks related to our software solutions or other performance problems
could significantly harm their and our reputations and businesses. With our current solutions strategy,
these risks increase because we are combining already complex products to create solutions that are
even more complicated than the aggregation of their product components. Significant technical
challenges could also arise with our software solutions, because our customers purchase and deploy
our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party
software applications and databases. These combinations increase our risk, with respect to our
customers, because, in the event of a system-wide failure, it may be difficult for the customer to
determine which product is at fault; thus, we may be blamed for the failure of another supplier’s
products.

As a result of the foregoing, we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market
share; loss of customers; damage to our reputation; an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts;

47


-----

an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable; higher development and testing and support
costs; failure to achieve market acceptance; diversion of development and support resources;
increased service and warranty costs; risks and expense of legal actions by customers against us,
which could, whether or not successful, increase costs and distract our management; and increased
insurance costs.

**_Future product development is dependent upon access to and reliability of third-party_**
**_software products and open source software._**

Certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third-party
software vendors. We expect that we may have to incorporate software from third-party vendors in our
future products. We also incorporate open source software in certain of our software products. We may
not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third-party or open source software currently
offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete, defective, non-compliant with third-party
patent restrictions or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained
or updated, or if our relationship with the third-party vendor terminates.

In addition, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of, and compliance with the licensing
requirements of, open source software. Any significant interruption in the availability of these third-party
software products on commercially acceptable terms, defects in these products, non-compliance with
third-party patent restrictions or our inability to comply with the licensing terms of either third-party
commercial software or open source software could delay development of future products or
enhancement of existing products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Future product development is dependent on adequate research and development resources._**

Both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in the market in which we operate and
competing for customers. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new products
and enhancements to our existing products in order to maintain or expand our market position. This is
particularly true as we further expand our cloud and SaaS offerings and capabilities. We expect to
continue to incur significant expenditures for development of our solutions which may not ultimately
grow our business or cause long-term profitability. Maintaining adequate research and development
resources to meet the demands of the market is essential, and our failure to do so could present an
advantage to our competitors. If we are unable to develop products due to certain constraints, such as
high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other development resources,
including through third-party outsourcing firms, our competitiveness could be harmed.

**_If the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our target market are_**
**_inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted and our business would be harmed._**

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are
based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts
in this offering circular relating to the size and expected growth of the market for our products and
services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates
and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.

The principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include the size and expected
growth rate of the global ITOM market, as well as a variety of adjacent enterprise and infrastructure
software markets. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that the strategic approach
that our software solutions enable for our potential customers will be more attractive to our customers
than that offered by our competitors.

48


-----

Historically, our investment in new products has expanded our market opportunity into areas of
growing strategic importance, and we continue to introduce new products to increase our addressable
market. However, if these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be adversely affected. For more information regarding our estimates of market
opportunity and the forecasts of market growth included in this offering circular, see “Business—Our
Industry.”

**_We are subject to risks associated with our indirect distribution channels._**

A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products and services through indirect
distribution channels such as resellers, systems integrators and strategic partners. In addition, we
maintain strategic agreements with hardware vendors permitting them to sell our software solutions as
part of their hardware systems. Conducting business through indirect distribution channels presents a
number of risks, including:

‰ our indirect channel partners typically can cease marketing our products and services with
limited or no notice and with little or no penalty;

‰ we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional indirect channel partners if we lose
any of our existing ones;

‰ our existing indirect channel partners may not be able to effectively sell new products and
services that we may introduce;

‰ we do not have direct control over the business practices, compliance programs and processes
or risk management policies adopted by our indirect channel partners and they may engage in
inappropriate practices without our knowledge, which could result in penalties and/or
reputational damage to us;

‰ our indirect channel partners may not be able to deliver the same quality or standard of
services that we do, which may require us to engage with their customers at a direct cost to us
to protect our product and services standards and reputation;

‰ our indirect channel partners may also offer competitive products and services through
acquisition or internal development and as such, may not give priority to the marketing of our
products and services as compared to our competitors’ products;

‰ we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and
marketing activities;

‰ our indirect channel partners may experience financial difficulties that may impact their ability to
market our products and may lead to delays, or even default, in their payment obligations to us;
and

‰ we also depend on our indirect channel partners for accurate and timely reporting of our
channel sales; any disruption, delay or under-reporting by our indirect channel partners could
have an adverse effect on our bookings, revenues and cash flows.

**_Changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our results of_**
**_operations._**

From time to time, we make significant changes in the organizational structure and compensation
plans of our sales organizations, which may increase the risk of sales personnel turnover. To the
extent that we experience turnover within our direct sales force or sales management, there is a risk
that the productivity of our sales force would be negatively impacted, which could lead to revenue
declines. Turnover within our sales force can cause disruption in sales cycles leading to delay or loss

49


-----

of business. In addition, it can take time to implement new sales management plans and to effectively
recruit and train new sales personnel. We review and modify our compensation plans for the sales
organization periodically. Changes to our sales compensation plans could make it difficult for us to
attract and retain top sales talent.

**_Changes in tax law, changes in our effective tax rate or exposure to additional income tax_**
**_liabilities could affect our profitability and financial condition._**

The taxing jurisdictions we are subject to or operate under may be subject to significant change.
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect
our financial position and results of operations. Many countries in Europe and Israel, as well as a
number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to
existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many
countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.

We carry out our business operations through entities in the U.S. and multiple foreign
jurisdictions. As such, we are required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S.
federal, state and foreign tax laws. Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax liabilities are determined, in
part, by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax
rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating
profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates as well as by the positioning of our cash
balances globally. Similarly, if statutory tax rates or tax bases were to increase or if changes in tax
laws, regulations or interpretations were made that impact us directly, our effective tax rate, earnings
and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted. We are also required to evaluate the
realizability of our deferred tax assets. This evaluation requires that our management assess the
positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income. If management’s
assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets changes, we will be required to
increase our valuation allowance, which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and earnings. We
are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions. Our provision for
income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the
examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts
ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts
included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense and operating cash
outflows.

Further, the U.S. federal income tax legislation recently enacted as Public Law No. 115-97 (the
“Tax Act”) is highly complex, subject to interpretation, and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law,
including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, significant additional limitations on the
deductibility of interest, substantial revisions to the taxation of international operations and limitations
on the use of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The
presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation
of the provisions contained in the Tax Act. In the future, the Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) are expected to release regulations and interpretive guidance relating to
the legislation contained in the Tax Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such
legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the
presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our
business.

**_Economic conditions and regulatory changes that may result from the United Kingdom’s_**
**_likely exit from the EU could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an
exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The announcement of Brexit caused significant
volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The
announcement of Brexit and likely withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may also create further global
economic uncertainty, which may cause our current and future customers to closely monitor their costs
and reduce their spending on our products and services.

Brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU,
which could result in the U.K. losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global
trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. gave formal
notice of its intention to leave the EU. This notice triggers the process of negotiating the U.K.’s exit,
which will occur in two years, unless the deadline is extended or a withdrawal agreement is negotiated
sooner. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear how Brexit may negatively impact the
economies of the U.K., the EU countries and other nations. Brexit and the perceptions as to the impact
of the withdrawal of the U.K. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic
conditions in the U.K., the EU and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We must protect our intellectual property rights._**

We rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality
procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to
protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to
misappropriate, copy or pirate certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use
technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Furthermore, our intellectual property
protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar
to or duplicative of our products and services. Unauthorized third parties may also infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights and there can be no assurance that
our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge as to their validity or enforceability or
provide significant protection for us, and any such legal actions could become costly. In addition, the
laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the
U.S. Furthermore, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions can be difficult to enforce and,
even if successfully enforced, may not be entirely effective. Additionally, certain of our license
arrangements have required us to place the source code for our software products into escrow for the
protection of another party. Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could also be impacted
by proposed changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing the protection of
patents and other intellectual property. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could
adversely affect our competitive position and revenue.

Litigation has been necessary, and may be necessary in the future, to enforce or protect our
intellectual property rights. That litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources
away from our business operations, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Further, attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights against
third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other
rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in
part. The inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary
rights could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

51


-----

**_Third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe their intellectual_**
**_property rights, exposing us to litigation that, regardless of merit, may be costly to defend._**

Our success and ability to compete are also dependent upon our ability to operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of others. Claims of patent and copyright infringement are common in
the software industry. Third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe
their intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim that our current or future products or services
infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Any such claim, with or without merit, could have a
significant effect on our business and financial results. Defending against any future third-party claim
could be time consuming, divert management’s attention from our business operations and result in
adverse judgments, settlements on unfavorable terms or substantial litigation costs, including any
monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations that may result from such claims. In
addition, parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting
our ability to market and license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property. In
addition, former employers of our employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly
disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Future litigation
may also involve non-practicing entities or other intellectual property owners who have no relevant
product offerings and against whom our own intellectual property may therefore provide little or no
deterrence. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract
management from our business operations. As a result of such claims, we may be required to obtain
licenses from third parties, or develop alternative technology or redesign our products. We cannot be
sure that any such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If a successful claim
is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology (or must spend
significant amounts to do so), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be materially adversely affected.

**_Certain software we use is derived from open source software, which, under certain_**
**_circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows._**

Some of our products contain open source software. The use of such open source software in
products made available to others may subject us to certain requirements, including the obligation to
offer, distribute, license, or make available our proprietary source code or license our patents to third
parties. Further, although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is
common for many such vendors to make their open source software available “as is” with no warranty,
indemnity or support. We monitor our use of such open source software to avoid subjecting our
products to requirements we do not intend. Any use of such open source software may ultimately
subject some of our products to unintended conditions, which could require us to take remedial action
that may divert resources away from our development efforts and which could have an adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for_**
**_intellectual property infringement and other losses._**

Our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include provisions under which
we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result
of claims of intellectual property infringement or other liabilities relating to or arising from our services
or platform or other acts or omissions. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual
breaches could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally
contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability
related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse
effects on our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce

52


-----

demand for our services and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_Cyber-attacks on our networks and actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our_**
**_products and services could have an adverse impact on our business and results of_**
**_operations._**

Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of cyber-attacks on their systems and
networks on an ongoing basis. In the course of our regular business operations and providing SaaS
maintenance support services to our customers, we process and transmit proprietary information and
sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others.
Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and
misappropriate, copy or pirate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system
disruptions or cause interruptions or shutdowns of our internal systems and services. A number of
websites have been subject to denial of service attacks, where a website is bombarded with
information requests eventually causing the website to overload, resulting in a delay or disruption of
service. Also, there is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and
coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach their security for malicious purposes. These
attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography,
including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or
ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. If successful, any of these
events could damage our computer systems and equipment or those of our third-party hosting vendors
or customers. Furthermore, these attacks could disrupt or prevent us from providing timely
maintenance, support and services to our customers and result in the theft or misappropriation of
proprietary, personally identifiable, confidential and sensitive information of ours, our employees, our
customers and our business partners and materially disrupt business for us, our customers and our
business partners.

Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and
other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security
vulnerabilities of our products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs,
viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the
efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of
existing or potential customers and may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution and other critical
functions. Security risks for us will also increase as we continue to grow our cloud-based offerings and
services, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data.

We have outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party vendors, and our business
operations also depend, in part, on the success of these third parties’ own cyber security measures.
Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our
IT resources in a safe and secure manner that does not expose our network systems to security
breaches and the loss of data. Our efforts to protect our data, that of our customers or the information
we receive from other third parties may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical
malfunctions, employee, contractor or vendor error or malfeasance, government surveillance or other
threats that evolve. Because the techniques used by such individuals or entities to access, disrupt or
sabotage devices, systems and networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched
against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, and we may not become aware in a
timely manner of such a security breach, which could exacerbate any damage we experience.

Affected users (including customers or third parties) or government authorities could initiate legal
or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosures of
data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent

53


-----

decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. A successful cyber-attack could also negatively
impact the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and harm our ability to keep existing
customers and to attract new customers. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect
on our business, reputation or financial results.

Recent legislation has increased the responsibilities of software companies and their clients
regarding financial security, identity theft and privacy. Our customers may not effectively implement all
of the updated security features that we introduce or make all necessary changes to their operating
procedures, or they may fail to implement other required security measures. Subsequent changes to
applicable privacy or data security laws could also impact how we process personal information, and
therefore limit the effectiveness of our products, services or features, or our ability to develop new
products, services or features.

**_Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our_**
**_reputation._**

We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation
claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if
possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish
reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These
assessments and estimates are based on the information available to us at the time and involve a
significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from
those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. In addition, we have business operations
in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict
compliance with all U.S. and international laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our
business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials.
Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always ensure full compliance
with all applicable legal requirements. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation,
regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.

**_We are subject to risks related to global operations._**

We are a global company that conducts sales, sales support, professional services, product
development and support, marketing and product distribution services from numerous offices
throughout the world. International non-GAAP revenue has historically represented approximately 50%
of our total non-GAAP revenue and also represented approximately 50% of our total non-GAAP
revenue in fiscal year 2018. Success in selling and developing our products throughout the world
depends on a variety of factors, risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various
countries, including:

‰ developing and executing an effective go-to-market strategy in various locations;

‰ difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including compliance with local
labor and employment laws and regulations;

‰ non-compliance with our code of conduct or other corporate policies;

‰ longer payment cycles;

‰ increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;

‰ adverse tax consequences;

‰ adverse impact of inflation;

‰ changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

54


-----

‰ restrictive local laws regarding the transfer of funds from, or the conversion of currencies in,
certain countries;

‰ restrictions on our ability to access cash in foreign jurisdictions;

‰ changes in global, economic and political landscapes;

‰ impact from volatile or sluggish local economies or global macroeconomic conditions;

‰ loss of proprietary information, including intellectual property, due to piracy, misappropriation or
weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection;

‰ the need to successfully localize our products;

‰ lack of appropriate local infrastructure to carry out operations;

‰ workforce reorganizations in various locations, including global reorganizations of sales,
research and development, technical services, finance, human resources and facilities
functions;

‰ political unrest, war or terrorism, particularly in areas in which we have employees and
facilities;

‰ potential vulnerability to computer system, internet or other systemic attacks, such as denial of
service, viruses or other malware, any of which may be caused by criminals, terrorists or other
sophisticated organizations;

‰ compliance by us and our services providers (including unaffiliated third-party service
providers) with a wide variety of complex and differing local laws, regulations and treaties,
including unexpected changes in (or new) legislative or regulatory requirements, such as
anti-corruption, competition, anti-money laundering, export control and data privacy laws and
regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the
“FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”), the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, as well as the new EU GDPR, which becomes effective in May
2018, the Network and Information Security Directive in the EU, trade controls and sanctions
administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in
other jurisdictions, early termination of contracts with government agencies, audits,
investigations, sanctions or penalties;

‰ licenses, tariffs, export controls, economic sanctions and other trade barriers;

‰ potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the Trump
administration, which has been critical of existing and proposed trade agreements; and

‰ natural disaster, disease or other extraordinary events impacting business continuity.

U.S. and international laws and regulations that apply to our global operations are complex and
increase our cost of doing business. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our international
operations include the FCPA, economic sanctions laws and export control laws. International laws and
regulations include local laws that also prohibit bribery, including commercial bribery (including the UK
Bribery Act), and corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as labor relations laws, tax laws,
anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Any change in
export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, increased export and import
controls stemming from Trump administration policies, retaliatory measures or change in the countries,
governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of
our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential
end-customers with international operations.

Additionally, our operations are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations relating to the
collection, storage, transmission, use, protection and disposal of data, and new laws in this area have

55


-----

been passed by several jurisdictions, while other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional
restrictions. Complying with emerging and changing requirements, both domestic and international,
may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. We have
adopted and implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with U.S. laws
and the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of these laws, rules and regulations
could result in criminal or civil fines against us, our officers or our employees; restrictions on the
conduct of our business; harm to our brand or reputation; and delays in potential acquisitions. Such
violations could result in penalties and other restrictions that may, under certain circumstances,
materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.

The unique risks of operating in a particular country may require us to adopt a different business
approach or strategy in that particular country, which could increase our cost of doing business or limit
the type of business activities we can perform in such country. In addition, if we suffer a business
disruption due to any of the risks listed above and do not have in place or are not able to implement
adequate response plans, our ability to support customers and maintain normal business operations
for a significant length of time could be hindered such that our competitive position could be
significantly impacted. Furthermore, our financial condition could be adversely impacted if our costs to
recover escalate due to such recovery occurring over a protracted period.

We maintain a significant presence in India, Israel and other emerging market countries,
conducting substantial software development and support, marketing operations, IT operations and
certain financial operations in those locations. Accordingly, we are directly affected by economic,
political, physical and electrical infrastructure and military conditions in these countries. Any major
hostilities or the interruption or curtailment of trade between these countries and their present trading
partners could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash
flows. We maintain contingency and business continuity plans for all significant locations, and to date,
various regional conflicts or other local economic or political issues have not caused any major adverse
impact on our operations in these countries. Should we be unable to conduct operations in these
regions in the future, and our contingency and business continuity plans are unsuccessful, our
business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, as the software and technology labor market in
these countries has developed at a rapid pace, with many multi-national companies competing for
talent, there is a risk that wage and attrition rates will rise faster than we have anticipated, which could
lead to higher costs and operational issues.

**_We face exposure to foreign currency exchange rates._**

We conduct significant transactions, including intercompany transactions, in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Israeli shekel, Indian rupee and British pound, or the functional
operating currency of the transactional entities, and our global subsidiaries maintain significant net
assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these
entities. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can
significantly affect our revenues and operating results due to transactional and translational
remeasurement that is reflected in our earnings. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposures may
adversely impact our operating results and operating cash flows.

**_We may lose key personnel, may not be able to hire enough qualified personnel or may fail to_**
**_integrate replacement personnel._**

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,
including sales, technical and management resources and the availability of skilled contract labor.
Experienced personnel in the IT industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is
intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and

56


-----

skills as experienced workers retire. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term
success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key
employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In addition, acquisitions could cause us
to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or our personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not
have long-term employment agreements with our employees.

In addition, we continually focus on improving our cost structure. We have been hiring personnel
and engaging third-party outsourcing firms in countries where advanced technical expertise is available
at lower costs, and we frequently utilize contract labor for short-term needs. We may also experience
increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues,
which may affect our employee retention efforts, increase our dependence on third-party outsourcing
firms and contract labor and/or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation
program for full-time employees.

We have also undertaken restructuring actions over the past several years to improve our cost
structure involving significant reductions in our workforce, relocation of job functions to lower-cost
overseas locations and changes to our organizational structure. We will continue to make
organizational changes aimed at improving our operating margins and driving operational efficiencies.
Some of these changes may result in future workforce reductions or rebalancing actions. These efforts
place a strain on our management, administrative, technical, operational and financial infrastructure.
Additionally, when we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with
workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure.

If we fail to manage these changes effectively, it could adversely affect our ability to manage our
business and our operating results.

**_Our business and products are dependent on the availability, integrity and security of IT_**
**_systems._**

Our IT systems and related software applications are integral to our business. We rely on controls
and systems to ensure data integrity of critical business information and proper operation of our
systems and networks. Lack of data integrity could create inaccuracies and hinder our ability to
perform meaningful business analysis and make informed business decisions. Despite network
security, disaster recovery and systems management measures in place, our disaster recovery
planning may not be sufficient for all situations, and we may encounter unexpected general systems
outages or failures that may affect our ability to conduct research and development, provide
maintenance and support of our products, manage our contractual arrangements, accurately and
efficiently maintain our books and records, record our transactions, provide critical information to our
management and prepare our financial statements. Additionally, these unexpected systems outages or
failures may require additional personnel and financial resources, disrupt our business or cause delays
in the reporting of our financial results. We may also be required to modify, enhance, upgrade or
implement new systems, procedures and controls to reflect changes in our business or technological
advancements, which could cause us to incur additional costs and require additional management
attention, placing burdens on our internal resources. Delays in modifying, enhancing, upgrading or
implementing our IT systems could limit the success or result in the failure of those initiatives and
impair the effectiveness of our internal controls. We also outsource certain IT-related functions to third
parties that are responsible for maintaining their own network security, disaster recovery and systems
management procedures. If we, or our third-party IT vendors, fail to manage our respective IT systems
and related software applications effectively, it could adversely affect our business operations,
operating results and cash flows. Failure to adequately address these issues, as well as to manage
and protect our infrastructure, could result in the diversion of management’s attention and resources
and adversely affect our ability to manage our business and to meet our obligations to our customers.

**_The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, became effective on_**
**_May 25, 2018. If we are found to be in non-compliance with the GDPR, we could be subject to_**
**_substantial monetary forfeitures and other penalties. Our business reputation could also_**
**_suffer._**

The EU adopted the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data
Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR provides for more significant forfeitures and penalties for
noncompliance than the regulation it replaces. Much remains unknown with respect to how regulators
will interpret and implement the GDPR. Should we be found to not be in compliance with the GDPR,
we could be subject to substantial monetary forfeitures and other penalties that could negatively impact
our operating results. Our business reputation could also suffer.

**_Changes in revenue recognition guidance will, and other generally accepted accounting_**
**_principles may, materially adversely affect our reported results of operations or financial_**
**_condition._**

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issues new
accounting principles. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,
_Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with subsequent amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017,_
which created new Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“Topic 606”) that will replace most
existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective for us. While we are
continuing to assess all potential effects of the new standard, we currently anticipate that this standard
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, revenue recognition policies and
financial statement disclosures, and believe the most significant impact relates to the timing of the
recognition of our software license revenue. Under Topic 606, more judgment and estimates will be
required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP.

We anticipate a significant reduction in deferred revenue upon adoption of Topic 606, principally
relating to the recognition of substantially all license revenue upon software transfer to our customers
(as opposed to recognition over time under existing accounting standards). We currently believe that
the point-in-time recognition requirement of Topic 606 will increase the volatility of our revenue and
earnings period to period.

Under Topic 606, a larger portion of our sales commissions and other incremental costs to
acquire contracts will be subject to capitalization as compared to our application of existing GAAP.
However, incremental costs related to software license deliverables will be expensed as incurred
whereas under our application of current GAAP, a portion of such costs are capitalized and amortized
commensurate with the timing of software license revenue recognition. Additionally, we currently
anticipate that we will amortize incremental costs related to new customer business over an expected
period of benefit of approximately five years, which is generally longer than amortization periods
utilized under our application of existing GAAP.

We are also currently assessing the income tax impacts related to Topic 606, mostly relating to
the potential impacts from earlier recognition of revenue and the associated reduction in deferred
revenue under the standard. Subject to our overall tax attributes and other factors, the adoption of
Topic 606 could result in an increase in income taxes payable and accelerated cash tax payment
requirements in periods subsequent to adoption of the standard in comparison to existing tax
treatment.

Market practices with respect to accounting policies and disclosures are still evolving, and
securities analysts and investors may not fully understand the implications of our accounting policies
and disclosures or how or why they may differ from similar disclosures by other companies. Changes

58


-----

to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, including, but not limited to, the
changes within Topic 606, could lead to changes in our accounting policies and systems. Such
changes could materially adversely affect our reported financial results.

**_We may encounter events or circumstances that would require us to record an impairment_**
**_charge relating to our goodwill or capitalized software and other intangible assets balances._**

Under GAAP, we are required to evaluate our intangible assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for
impairment at least annually, and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In future
periods, we may be subject to factors that may constitute a change in circumstances, indicating that
the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds its fair value or our intangible assets may not be
recoverable. These changes may consist of, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price and
market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry. Any
of these factors, or others, could require us to record a significant non-cash impairment charge in our
financial statements during a period. Acquisitions can result in additional goodwill or intangible assets
balances subject to impairment risk. If we determine that a significant impairment of our goodwill or
intangible assets has occurred in any of our operating segments, this could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have not been, and after this offering will not be, subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of_**
**_2002 and, therefore, will not be required to provide a management report of our internal_**
**_controls and our internal and disclosure controls may not be as robust as they would be if we_**
**_were subject to this law or similar laws._**

Although we have devoted management and financial resources to enhance our internal controls
over financial reporting, all internal control systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent
limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of changing conditions such as
the integrations of acquisitions, the effectiveness of our internal controls may vary over time and we
must continue to maintain and upgrade our internal controls. Significant costs are involved with
maintaining our technology and internal control infrastructure. If we are unable to efficiently and
effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain
of our internal controls may become ineffective or vulnerable. Any failure in the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting, which
could negatively impair our ability to execute our business strategy and our ability to deliver accurate
and timely financial information.

We have not been subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) or any similar law or
regulation and, because we will not register the Notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we
will not be subject to SOX or similar laws after this offering. SOX requires public companies to have
and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material
information and to have management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis.
The Securities Act also requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over
financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements and to have management review the effectiveness of those controls
on an annual basis (and have the independent registered public accounting firm attest to the
effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to, and we do not intend to voluntarily,
comply with these requirements. Consequently, we may have material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in our internal controls that we are not able to detect and this could have a material effect
on our financial reporting, the accuracy of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet reporting
obligations. As a result, investor confidence in our financial reports could decline, and the trading price
of the Notes could be adversely impacted.

**_Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be controlled by the Sponsor, whose_**
**_interests may not be aligned with ours or yours._**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be controlled by the Sponsor, which has the
power to control our affairs and policies, including entering into mergers, sales of all or substantially all
of our assets and other extraordinary transactions, as well as decisions to issue shares, declare
dividends, pay advisory fees and make other decisions, even though such transactions may involve
risk to you as a holder of the Notes. Neither the Sponsor nor its affiliates have any obligation to
contribute additional funds (directly or indirectly) to us. The Sponsor will not have any liability for any
obligations under the Notes and its interests could conflict with your interests in material respects.
Furthermore, the Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to
time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, as well as
businesses that represent major customers of our businesses. The Sponsor may also pursue
acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsor continues to own a significant amount
of our outstanding equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our
decisions. For information concerning our arrangements with the Sponsor following the Transactions,
see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability_**
**_to raise additional capital to fund our operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations_**
**_under the Notes._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of
March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
outstanding indebtedness of $6,219.1 million, including the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes offered
hereby, our USD Term Loan Facility in the principal amount of $3,300.0 million, the Euro Term Loan
Facility in the principal amount of €930.0 million and $17.2 million of other debt. Additionally, we would
have had availability under our Revolving Credit Facility of $400.0 million (excluding $31.7 million of
outstanding letters of credit). Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including but not limited to, the
agreement of lenders to provide such facilities or commitments, we will also have the option under our
Credit Facilities to add one or more incremental term loan or revolving credit facilities or increase
commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility, in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the sum of
(a) the greater of (i) $700.0 million and (ii) 85% of Consolidated EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to the
credit agreement that will govern the Credit Facilities) and (b) the aggregate amount of voluntary
prepayments of loans and voluntary commitment reductions (in each case, to the extent not funded
with the proceeds of long-term debt), plus (ii) an additional unlimited amount subject to compliance with
certain leverage-based criteria set forth in the Credit Facilities. The Existing Credit Facilities will be
repaid and terminated upon consummation of the Merger. The indenture governing the Notes will allow
for even greater “incremental” secured debt capacity than permitted under our Credit Facilities. See
“Description of Notes.”

Our high level of debt could have important consequences to us and to the holders of the Notes,
including:

‰ making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other
debt;

‰ an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or our other
indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the
indenture that will govern the Notes or agreements governing other indebtedness, which event
of default could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the indenture and

60


-----

in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, our other indebtedness, and could permit
our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt;

‰ limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;

‰ requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments
instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working
capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;

‰ increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive
conditions;

‰ exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including
borrowings under our Credit Facilities, bear interest at variable rates, which could further
adversely impact our cash flows;

‰ limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the industry in
which we compete;

‰ restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic
divestitures;

‰ impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;

‰ preventing us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the
occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event
of default under the indenture that will govern the Notes;

‰ placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and

‰ increasing our cost of borrowing.

The occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of
our outstanding debt.

**_Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, the Credit Facilities and the indenture_**
**_governing the Notes will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur substantially more debt,_**
**_including senior secured indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with the_**
**_Notes._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future,
including senior secured indebtedness. Although the credit agreement that will govern the Credit
Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions,
and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these
restrictions do not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes, the holders of
that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any
insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company, subject to any
collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. In
addition, as of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would
have had $6,219.1 million in total indebtedness consisting of (i) $4,376.9 million equivalent senior
secured indebtedness, including $3,300.0 million under our USD Term Loan Facility and
$1,076.9 million equivalent under our Euro Term Loan Facility (based on an exchange rate of 1.158
used for purposes of the Euro Term Loan Facility conversion), (ii) $1,825.0 million equivalent of

61


-----

senior unsecured debt consisting of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes offered hereby and (iii) $17.2
million of other debt. We would also have availability under our Revolving Credit Facility of
$400.0 million (excluding $31.7 million of outstanding letters of credit). Any such borrowings and the
borrowings under our USD Term Loan Facility and Euro Term Loan Facility would be secured
indebtedness and therefore would be effectively senior to the Notes and the note guarantees by the
guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. To the extent we and our
subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to our level of indebtedness would
increase. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

**_To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on_**
**_many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, and to
fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate
cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations or
we are unable to borrow additional debt, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such
as:

‰ refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Notes;

‰ selling assets;

‰ reducing or delaying scheduled expansions and capital investments; or

‰ seeking to raise additional capital.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into these alternative financing plans on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, any alternative financing plans that we may be
required to undertake may not be successful and, even if successful, may still not guarantee that we
would be able to meet our debt service obligations. Our Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the
Notes offered hereby, will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the
disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we
could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations
then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including our
obligations under the Notes, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

**_We will need to repay or refinance borrowings under our Credit Facilities prior to the maturity_**
**_of the Notes. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon us._**

We expect that our USD Term Loan Facility, our Euro Term Loan Facility and our Revolving
Credit Facility will mature in 2025, 2025 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had $3,300.0 million of term loan
borrowings under the USD Term Loan Facility and €930.0 million of term loan borrowings under the
Euro Term Loan Facility, with $400.0 million of availability (excluding $31.7 million of outstanding
letters of credit) under our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

Consequently, prior to the maturity of the Notes, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or
otherwise extend the maturity of our Credit Facilities. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace or extend

62


-----

will be dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the
general condition of the financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are
required to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities, we could be forced to
undertake alternate financings, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of our Credit Facilities or sell
assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay
indebtedness under our Credit Facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate
any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Our failure to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our Credit Facilities could
result in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the Notes and our Credit Facilities,
which could lead to an acceleration or repayment of substantially all of our outstanding debt.

**_The covenants in the credit agreement that will govern our Credit Facilities and the indenture_**
**_that will govern the Notes will impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial_**
**_flexibility and may limit our ability to make payments on the Notes._**

The credit agreement that will govern our Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the
Notes will contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our and our restricted
subsidiaries’ ability, among other things, to:

‰ incur additional indebtedness;

‰ pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;

‰ prepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness;

‰ create certain liens;

‰ sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

‰ make certain investments;

‰ create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries;

‰ engage in transactions with affiliates;

‰ create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

‰ consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our
subsidiaries.

In the event that an amount over a specified threshold is borrowed and outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility, for so long as any such amount is outstanding, we will be required to comply
with a total net first lien secured leverage ratio. See “Description of Notes” and “Description of Certain
Other Indebtedness.”

These covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations
or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand, pursue our business strategies
and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by
circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in
regulations, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These
restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our
business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to
take actions that are not favorable to holders of the Notes and may make it more difficult for us to
successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to
such restrictions.

A breach of any covenant in the Credit Facilities or the agreements and indentures governing any
other indebtedness that we may have outstanding from time to time, including the indenture that will

63


-----

govern the Notes, would result in a default under that agreement or indenture after any applicable
grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the
agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the debt outstanding under other
debt agreements. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow
sufficient funds to refinance such debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be
on terms that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in
default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes—
Events of Default and Remedies.”

**_Your right to receive payments on the Notes and the note guarantees is effectively junior to_**
**_those lenders who have a security interest in our assets including lenders under our Credit_**
**_Facilities._**

Our obligations under the Notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the
Notes are unsecured, but our obligations under our Credit Facilities and each guarantor’s obligations
under its guarantee of the Credit Facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our
tangible and intangible assets, including the stock and assets of certain of our current and certain
future subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
we would have had $3,300.0 million in secured debt under the USD Term Loan Facility, €930.0 million
in secured debt under the Euro Term Loan Facility and our Revolving Credit Facility would have
provided for unused availability of $400.0 million, all of which would have been effectively senior to the
Notes, in addition to $17.2 million in other debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under our Credit Facilities, the
lenders thereunder could declare all of the funds borrowed under our Credit Facilities, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the
lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the Notes, even if an event
of default exists under the indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby at such time.
Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor
under the Notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Notes automatically and
immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the Notes will not be secured by any of our or
our subsidiaries’ assets, including the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there
would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained,
they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”
As a result, you may lose a portion of or the entire value of your investment in the Notes.

In addition, the indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby will permit us and our
restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional
senior secured indebtedness.

**_The Issuer’s ability to service and repay its debt, including the Notes, will be dependent in_**
**_part on the cash flows generated by its subsidiaries._**

Repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, will depend in part on our subsidiaries’
generation of cash flow and our subsidiaries’ ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend,
debt repayment or otherwise. Subsidiaries that are not guarantors will not have any obligation to pay
amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Each subsidiary is a distinct
legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to
obtain cash from them. While the Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes will limit
the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur consensual encumbrances that include restrictions
on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are
subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive cash from our

64


-----

subsidiaries, we will be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on
our indebtedness, including the Notes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Your claims to our assets will be structurally subordinated to all of the creditors of any_**
**_non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

We conduct a substantial portion of our business through our subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of
our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will generally have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the
Notes. For the year ended March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
the non-guarantors accounted for approximately $483.8 million or 49.0% of our total revenue,
$451.2 million, or 55.4%, of our Non-GAAP EBITDA, excluding intercompany transactions, and as of
March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantors
accounted for approximately $3,778.1 million, or 35.8%, of our consolidated assets, and approximately
$1,125.1 million, or 13.6%, of our consolidated liabilities, each excluding intercompany balances.

The Notes will only be guaranteed by our present and future direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries that serve as a guarantor or obligor under our Credit Facilities or other capital markets
debt securities. Other subsidiaries are not required to guarantee the Notes and will have no obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the Notes, or to make any funds available
therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Accordingly, claims of holders of
the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
payables, will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for
distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the Notes.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make_**
**_payments on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the
Credit Facilities, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of
such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes
and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash
flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various
covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of
the agreements governing such indebtedness, including our Credit Facilities and the indenture that will
govern the Notes offered hereby. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could
elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, the lenders under our Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments
thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and
we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the
future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our Credit Facilities to avoid being in
default. If we breach our covenants under our Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able
to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Credit
Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_We may enter into certain transactions that would not constitute a change of control but that_**
**_result in an increase of our indebtedness._**

Subject to limitations under the indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby and the Credit
Facilities, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or
other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will
govern the Notes and the Credit Facilities, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings in a way that
adversely affects the holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control.”

**_You may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to your right to have_**
**_the Notes repurchased by us has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our_**
**_assets._**

A change of control, as defined in the indenture that will govern the Notes, will require us to make
an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes. The definition of change of control includes a phrase
relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precisely
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a
holder of Notes to require us to repurchase their Notes as a result of a sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another
individual, group or entity may be uncertain.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have
sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control.
Additionally, under the Credit Facilities, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of
default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective
agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the
Notes and repayment of borrowings under our Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash
generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided
by our existing or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of
control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities
that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due.
Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our Credit Facilities or the
documentation governing our other indebtedness from repurchasing all of the Notes tendered by
holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to
purchase the Notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our Credit Facilities. Our
failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture
that will govern the Notes and a cross-default under the Credit Facilities. We may require additional
financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on
satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In
addition, certain corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of
our indebtedness, would not constitute a “change of control” under the indenture even though those
corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital
structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_We face risks related to rating agency downgrades._**

We expect one or more rating agencies to rate the Notes. If such rating agencies either assign
the Notes a rating lower than the rating expected by the investors or reduce the rating in the future, the
market price of the Notes would be adversely affected, and you may not be able to resell your Notes at
favorable prices or at all. In addition, if any of our other outstanding debt is rated and subsequently
downgraded, raising capital will become more difficult, borrowing costs under our Credit Facilities and
other future borrowings may increase and the market price of the Notes may decrease.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply to us if the_**
**_Notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will cease to apply to the Notes
during such time, if any, as the Notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and
Fitch and no default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants restrict,
among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions.
Although there can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, any
suspension of such covenants under the indenture would allow us to engage in certain transactions
that would not be permitted when such covenants were in force. To the extent any suspended
covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended
would not result in an event of default under the indenture on the basis that such actions would have
been prohibited by the covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Effectiveness of
Covenants.”

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_notes guarantees will be released automatically, including that the lenders under the Credit_**
**_Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantors under the Credit Facilities in a_**
**_variety of circumstances._**

Under various circumstances, the notes guarantees will be released automatically. The notes
guarantee of a guarantor will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in
connection with a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of the equity interests or all or
substantially of the assets of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will
govern the Notes. The indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the notes
guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released.

In addition, if a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Credit Facilities, other than in
connection with a refinancing of the Credit Facilities or a payment under such guarantee, such
subsidiary’s guarantee of the Notes will be automatically released as well. While any obligations under
the Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the Notes may be released without action by,
or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the Trustee under the indenture governing the Notes, at the
discretion of lenders under the Credit Facilities as a result of such guarantor being released as a
guarantor of the Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions. The lenders under the Credit Facilities
will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Credit Facilities in a variety of
circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a
guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether
secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of holders of the Notes.
For a description of all circumstances in which a notes guarantee will be automatically released, see
“Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

67


-----

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its note guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided_**
**_or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all_**
**_of the guarantors._**

You have the benefit of the note guarantees of the subsidiary guarantors. However, the note
guarantees by the guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to
guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be
reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the
circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and
transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other
obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to
void the Notes and note guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the
Notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain
circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes and note_**
**_guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the
Notes and the incurrence of the note guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable
provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the Notes and the note guarantees may be voided, or
claims in respect of the Notes and the note guarantees may be subordinated to all of our other debt if,
among other things, the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee was found to have been made for less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and we, at the time we incurred the
indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, or a guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness
evidenced by its guarantee:

‰ was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; or

‰ was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

‰ intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they mature; or

‰ was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages
docketed against it, if in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied.

A court might also void the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee, without regard to the above
factors, if the court found that we issued the Notes or the guarantor entered into its guarantee with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes or its guaranty if we or the guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or
indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Because the note guarantees are for our benefit and only
indirectly for the benefit of the guarantors, a court could conclude that the guarantors received less
than fully equivalent value.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending
upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred.
Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

‰ the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of
all of its assets; or

68


-----

‰ if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required
to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

‰ it could not pay its debts as they become due.

Each guaranty contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum
amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guaranty to be a
fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the note guarantees from being
voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes the guaranty worthless. In a Florida bankruptcy case (which was
reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in 2012 on other grounds),
this type of provision was found to be ineffective to protect guarantors.

We cannot assure you as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or
that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may
not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court
might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the guarantor. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any payment on the
Notes. Further, the voidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our
subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt.

**_We do not intend to offer to register the Notes or to exchange the Notes in a registered_**
**_exchange offer._**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and,
unless so registered, may not be re-offered or re-sold except pursuant to an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We do not intend to
register the Notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the Notes for Notes that have been
registered under the Securities Act in an exchange offer. As a result, for so long as the Notes remain
outstanding, they may be transferred or re-sold only in transactions exempt from the securities
registration requirements of federal and applicable state laws. In addition, we will not be subject to the
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and
holders of Notes will only be entitled to receive the information about us specified in “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” including the information required by
Rule 144A(d)(4). The information about the Company will be provided on a confidential basis and may
not be copied or reproduced, nor may it be distributed or any of its contents disclosed, to anyone other
than holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4).

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being_**
**_registered with the SEC._**

This offering circular does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering the offering of the Notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering circular does not contain
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, certain executive compensation information or the guarantor/
non-guarantor footnote that would be required under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. In addition, this
offering circular includes pro forma adjustments to certain financial measures that may not be
permitted in an SEC filing because they are not permitted by Article 11 of Regulation S-X or otherwise.
We urge you to consider this factor in connection with your evaluation of your investment in the Notes.
For additional information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

**_The pro forma and non-GAAP financial information included in this offering circular is_**
**_presented for informational purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial_**
**_condition or results of operations in the future._**

The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this offering circular is presented for
informational purposes only. The assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information
may not prove to be accurate and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of
operations. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations in the future may not be
consistent with, or evident from, such pro forma financial information. The non-GAAP financial
information included in this offering circular includes information that we use to evaluate our past
performance, but you should not consider such information in isolation from or as an alternative to
measures of our performance determined under GAAP. For further information regarding such
limitations, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Financial and Operational Data.”

**_We may not achieve all of the expected cost savings included in Pro Forma Non-GAAP_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA._**

Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering circular includes certain
adjustments related to anticipated benefits and cost savings. These adjustments are described in the
footnotes to the summary historical information under the heading “Summary—Summary Historical
Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Data” in this offering
circular and reflect items that will generally be permitted by the indenture that will govern the Notes and
the credit agreement that will govern the Credit Facilities, and may not comply with the SEC’s rules
governing the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and
Reconciliations.”

Such anticipated but unrealized benefits are necessarily speculative and subject to certain
management estimates and assumptions, and our ability to realize the expected benefits or cost
savings also depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating
costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or market
conditions. Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and
performance and our reputation and results of operations could be harmed if employee morale,
engagement or productivity decline as a result of these changes.

We have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $17 million through March 31, 2018, and
expect to incur approximately $6 million in additional costs in fiscal year 2019, to achieve these
anticipated cost savings. None of these $23 million in restructuring costs are netted from our actioned
cost savings adjustment or otherwise have reduced our Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as
presented herein. If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are less than our estimates, or our
improvement initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement than
we project, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially adversely affected. These actions may not provide the expected benefits
and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in
employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of key
customer and supplier relationships. As such, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
achieving these cost savings.

**_We may redeem your Notes at our option, which may adversely affect your return._**

As described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” we have the right to redeem
either series of Notes in whole or in part beginning on September 1, 2021, at the redemption prices set
forth in this offering circular, and the Notes of either series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part

70


-----

before the Notes of the other series are optionally redeemed in full (or at all). Prior to September 1,
2021, we may also redeem (1) up to 100% of each series of Notes at a redemption price of 100% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus a make-whole premium and accrued interest and (2) up to
40% of each series Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the
annual coupon of the applicable series of Notes and accrued interest. We may choose to exercise this
redemption right when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to
reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that
of the Notes.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market,_**
**_and an active trading market for the Notes may not develop._**

The Notes and note guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
and are, and will be, subject to transfer restrictions. Accordingly, there will not be an established public
market for the Notes. We do not intend to have the Dollar Notes listed on a national securities
exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation systems. We intend to apply
to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. This listing application
for the Euro Notes will be subject to approval by the Authority. There are no assurances that the Euro
Notes will be listed on the Official List of and admitted to trade on the Exchange. Certain of the initial
purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations; however, such initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in any of the
Notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
an active market for any of the Notes may not develop, and if a market for any of the Notes does
develop, that market may not continue. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may
trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market
for similar Notes, our performance and other factors. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will
depend on a number of factors, including the number of holders of Notes, our operating performance
and financial condition, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a
market in the Notes and prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for any of
the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the
prices at which you may sell your Notes.

**_The Euro Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International_**
**_Stock Exchange, and the Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro_**
**_Notes in certain circumstances._**

Although the Issuer will seek to have the Euro Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange
within a reasonable period after the issue date of such notes, the Issuer cannot assure you that the
Euro Notes will become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange. The Issuer is under no
obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes on the Official List of Exchange and may cause the
Euro Notes to be de-listed in circumstances where, among others, the continued listing would require
preparation of financial statements in accordance with standards other than those accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States or we determine that maintenance of such listing
otherwise becomes burdensome. In such cases, the Issuer will be obliged to use commercially
reasonably efforts to seek an alternative listing for the Euro Notes on another stock exchange.
However, if, among others, such an alternative listing is not available to us or is, in our opinion, unduly
burdensome, an alternative listing for the Euro Notes may not be obtained. See “Description of
Notes—Maintenance of Listing.” The Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official
List of the Exchange and may seek to obtain and maintain the listing of the Euro Notes on another

71


-----

stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Euro Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the
Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the
indenture that will govern the Euro Notes, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of Euro
Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with such
indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to sell the Euro Notes.
Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application
for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

**_The Issuer does not currently control BMC and its subsidiaries and will not control BMC and_**
**_its subsidiaries until completion of the Merger._**

The Issuer does not currently control BMC and its subsidiaries and will not control BMC and its
subsidiaries until completion of the Merger. Until that time, the Issuer cannot assure you that BMC’s
business will be operated in the way it would be under the Issuer’s control.

**_The right of holders of the Notes to receive any premium on the Notes under circumstances_**
**_other than an optional redemption is unclear under applicable law._**

The case law surrounding the right, if any, of holders to receive any premium on the Notes under
circumstances other than an optional redemption is unclear under applicable law. Accordingly, any
right to receive the premium, including any premium described under the second paragraph under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” in circumstances other than an optional redemption by
us of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the Notes described under “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption” (including as a remedy in connection with an Event of Default or otherwise), is
unclear under applicable law, and will likely depend upon the particular facts and circumstances.

**_If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem each_**
**_series of Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The gross proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes will be deposited into the applicable
Escrow Account. The release of escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as
the release of such escrowed funds. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions,
including regulatory approval. If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside
Date, and upon the occurrence of certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes
will not be released to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the
trustee under the indenture for the purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special
mandatory redemptions described in “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes.

The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the Notes to, but not
including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in respect of interest that would
accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into
the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and its affiliates will commit on
or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a special mandatory
redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that are available to be
applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and
the special mandatory redemption price. There can be no assurance that such funds or partnerships
will have sufficient funds necessary to pay any shortfall required to fund a special mandatory
redemption.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the Notes and the consummation of the Merger, the_**
**_parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of_**
**_such document without noteholder consent._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to
amendments or waivers of, or consents to departures or deviations from, the terms thereof and holders
of the Notes will not have the ability to veto any such actions. Although no such amendment, waiver or
consent is presently contemplated, if the parties to the Merger Agreement decide to make changes to
the terms thereof (including to the purchase price) or to waive conditions thereunder, the holders of the
Notes will not be able to prevent the release of the Escrowed Property to fund the Merger as a result of
any such action and will not have any veto or consent rights in respect of any such actions.

**_Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Issuer will have limited assets and the_**
**_Company and its subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes and the Company and its_**
**_subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern_**
**_the Notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries as the Notes will be the obligations of Merger Sub only. Merger Sub
does not conduct any material operations and has no material assets (other than the escrowed
proceeds). Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries will
not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes. Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries generally are required to operate in the
ordinary course of business prior to the consummation of the Merger.

**_In a bankruptcy proceeding, the holders of Notes might not be able to apply the escrowed_**
**_funds to repay the Notes without bankruptcy court approval._**

If we commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against us, while the
Escrow Account remains funded, bankruptcy law may prevent the trustee under the indenture
governing the Notes from using the escrowed funds to pay the special mandatory redemption. The
court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account is the property of the bankruptcy
estate. Although the amounts in the Escrow Account will be pledged as security for the Notes during
the term of the escrow, the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit
secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtors’ property without bankruptcy court
approval. As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account
applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture that will govern the Notes and could
suffer a loss as a result. If the court adjudicating that case finds that the Escrowed Property is the
property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of such funds by the bankruptcy
estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions. As a result, the holders
of the Notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate. In such event, the only
remedy available to the holders of the Notes would be to sue for payment on the Notes.

**_If, after the release of the funds from escrow, we file a bankruptcy petition, or if a bankruptcy_**
**_petition is filed against us, you may receive a lesser amount for your claim under the Notes_**
**_than you would have been entitled to receive under the Indenture governing the Notes._**

If, after the release of the funds from escrow, we file a bankruptcy petition under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the Notes, or if such a bankruptcy petition is filed against us,
your claim against us for the principal amount of your Notes may be limited to an amount equal to:

‰ the original issue price for the Notes; and

73


-----

‰ the portion of original issue discount that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for purposes
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of any bankruptcy filing would
constitute unmatured interest. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you may receive a lesser
amount than you would have been entitled to receive under the terms of the Indenture governing the
Notes, even if sufficient funds are available.

**_An investment in the Euro Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not euro entails_**
**_significant risks._**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the Euro Notes and any redemption price for the
Euro Notes will be made in euros. These risks include the risk that exchange rates may significantly
change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the holder’s currency) and
the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the holder’s currency may impose or modify exchange
controls. An investment in the Euro Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not euro entails
significant risks.

These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic,
financial and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past,
rates of exchange between euro and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder
should be aware that volatility may occur in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that
have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may
occur during the term of the Euro Notes. An appreciation in the value of the holder’s currency relative
to the euro would decrease the holder’s currency-equivalent yield on the Euro Notes, the holder’s
currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Euro Notes and the holder’s currencyequivalent market value of the Euro Notes, and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the
holder. See “Currency Presentation and Exchange Rate Data.” Governments and monetary authorities
may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an
applicable exchange rate. As a result, holders of the Euro Notes may receive less interest or principal
than expected, or no interest or principal.

**_The terms of the Euro Notes provided for in the indenture governing such Notes will permit_**
**_us to make payments in U.S. dollars if the Issuer is unable to obtain euros in certain_**
**_circumstances, which could adversely affect the value of the Euro Notes._**

The terms of the Euro Notes will permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if the euro is
unavailable to the Issuer due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the
Issuer’s control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European
Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by
public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the
Euro Notes and the related note guarantees as required pursuant to the indenture that will govern the
Euro Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available for the Issuer to be used. In
such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars on the
basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for euros, as the case may be.

Any payment so made in respect of the Euro Notes and the related note guarantees as required
pursuant to the indenture that will govern the Euro Notes in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of
default under such indenture. Neither the trustee under such indenture nor the paying agent
thereunder will have any responsibility for effecting any such conversion.

74


-----

**_There may be risks associated with foreign currency judgments in a lawsuit for payment on_**
**_the Euro Notes, for which an investor may bear currency exchange risk._**

The indenture that will govern the Euro Notes and the Euro Notes themselves will be governed by
the laws of the State of New York. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment
on the Euro Notes would be required to render the judgment in euros.

However, in such a situation, the judgment would then be converted into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment by the New York State court.
Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Euro Notes, investors of such Euro Notes would bear
currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time. In
addition, a federal court in New York presiding over a dispute arising in connection with the Euro Notes
may apply the foregoing New York law or in certain circumstances may render the judgment in U.S.
dollars.

In courts outside of New York, investors of such Euro Notes may not be able to obtain a judgment
in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the
Euro Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States
only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would
depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment is
rendered.

You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment
in the Euro Notes. The Euro Notes are not an appropriate investment for investors who are
unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions.

**_The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented_**
**_through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of your_**
**_rights under the Euro Notes._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes,
owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Euro Notes except in the
limited circumstances provided in the indenture governing such Euro Notes. The common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its nominee) will be the sole registered holder of the global notes
representing the Euro Notes. After payment to the common depositary, the Issuer will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal, or other amounts to the owners of bookentry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream,
on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder under the Indenture governing such Euro Notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and
Form.”

Unlike the holders of the Euro Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers, or other actions from holders
of the Euro Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the
extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no
assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you
to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Euro
Notes, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or
Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or
Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Euro Notes.

-----

**_Holders of the Notes will have not have contract claims against our foreign subsidiaries and,_**
**_even if they did, they may not be able to effect service of process or enforce judgments_**
**_obtained against us outside of the United States._**

Holders of the Notes will only have contract claims for payment under the indenture and the
Notes against the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes, all of which will be organized in the United
States. We have subsidiaries organized outside the United States that hold a significant portion of our
consolidated assets and represent a majority of our Non-GAAP EBITDA. These subsidiaries organized
outside the United States will not be required to provide guarantees of the Euro Notes or the Dollar
Notes and will not have any obligations under, or in respect of, the indenture and the Notes. As a
result, holders of the Notes will not have any claims for payment against these subsidiaries. Moreover,
even if our subsidiaries were to provide guarantees in respect of the Notes even without an obligation
to do so, it may not be possible for holders of the Notes to effect service of process on them or enforce
judgments obtained against them outside the United States.

**_The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture_**
**_Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”) and we will not be required to comply_**
**_with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we
will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act
except to the extent there are similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Merger**

Effective May 25, 2018, Boxer Parent Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Merger Agreement”) with Parent, Merger Sub and the Representative, pursuant to which, at the
closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, Parent, via Merger Sub, will acquire Boxer Parent
Company and Merger Sub will be merged with and into Boxer Parent Company with Boxer Parent
Company surviving the merger (the “Merger”).

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Boxer Parent Company’s common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain shares of common stock subject
to customary exceptions), and all vested and outstanding options to acquire Boxer Parent Company’s
common stock, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive cash consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Certain
members of Boxer Parent Company’s management may agree to “roll over” a percentage of their
ownership of Boxer Parent Company’s common stock into Parent’s common stock. The aggregate
purchase price for the Company’s outstanding equity will be based on a base merger consideration of
$8,300.0 million in cash, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the Company,
customary representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub and customary covenants and
other agreements among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. The closing of the Merger is subject
to (i) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, (ii) the expiration of all applicable waiting periods or receipt of required approvals
under the foreign competition laws (or other laws) identified by the parties in certain specified
jurisdictions, (iii) the absence of any law or order by any governmental body prohibiting the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iv) other customary closing
conditions.

Either Boxer Parent Company or Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the
closing:

‰ by mutual written consent;

‰ if any government authority issues a law or any final and non-appealable order enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(provided no termination may be made by a party whose breach of the Merger Agreement has
primarily resulted in or caused such law or order);

‰ if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have not been consummated on or
before November 26, 2018; provided that the party seeking termination has not been a primary
cause thereof and; provided further that this initial end date shall be extended to February 26,
2019 at the election of either Boxer Parent Company or Parent if, as of November 26, 2018, (A)
all of the closing conditions have been met (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the closing) but the marketing period has not been completed (or the second
business day following the completion of the marketing period has not occurred) or (B) all of the
closing conditions have been met, other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing and other than the closing conditions described in clauses (i) or (ii) in the immediately
preceding paragraph or the closing condition described in clause (iii) in the immediately
preceding paragraph as it relates to the conditions described in clauses (i) or (ii) in the
immediately preceding paragraph); or

‰ upon the uncured breach or failure to perform of the other party in certain circumstances.

77


-----

In addition, Boxer Parent Company may terminate the Merger Agreement in certain
circumstances if all closing conditions (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing provided such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the closing) have been satisfied or
waived and Parent fails to consummate the Merger within three business days of the date the closing
is required to occur under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances, Parent may be required to pay a termination fee to Boxer Parent Company.

Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will be a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Parent. All of Parent’s outstanding capital stock will be owned by entities affiliated with KKR, other than
(i) any capital stock or options issued to management in connection with their “rollover” of equity of
Boxer Parent Company or otherwise granted in connection with Parent’s management equity plans
and (ii) any PIK Preferred Equity held by investors unaffiliated with KKR. Parent will use the cash from
the Sponsor Equity Contribution, cash on hand, the net proceeds of the PIK Preferred Equity
contribution, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and the net proceeds from this offering of Notes to
pay the Merger consideration under the Merger Agreement, repay certain existing indebtedness, pay
related fees and expenses and fund cash to the balance sheet.

Upon consummation of the Merger, we will enter into certain arrangements with entities related to
KKR. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” for more information
regarding these arrangements.

**The Financing Transactions**

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we anticipate the following will occur:

‰ the entry into the Credit Facilities, including: (i) the $400.0 million Revolving Credit Facility
(which we expect to remain undrawn at the closing of the Merger); (ii) the USD Term Loan
Facility (all $3,300.0 million of which will be borrowed to finance the Merger); and (iii) the
€930.0 million Euro Term Loan Facility (all €930.0 million of which will be borrowed to finance
the Merger);

‰ the release from escrow of the gross proceeds of the $1,475.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Dollar Notes and €301.5 million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes offered
hereby;

‰ the contribution by Parent to Merger Sub of the net proceeds received by it from the issuance
by Parent of PIK Preferred Equity in an aggregate amount of $300.0 million to affiliates of the
Sponsor and/or other investors that commit to purchase a portion of PIK Preferred Equity; and

‰ the Sponsor Equity Contribution committed to be made to Parent by the Sponsor and the
Rollover Offer Participants of $2,100.0 million, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger.

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will
execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross
proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes into the applicable Escrow Account. The release of
escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the
Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, and upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the
purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to

78


-----

100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue
date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in
respect of interest that would accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes
will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and
its affiliates will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a
special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that
are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory
redemption and the special mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” We will repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing
Credit Facilities and discharge or defease the Existing Notes on the date we consummate the Merger.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

For a more detailed description of the Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness,” and for a more detailed description of the Notes offered hereby, see “Description of
Notes.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
closing of the Transactions, assuming the Transactions closed on March 31, 2018. The actual amount
of sources and uses of cash as of the date of the Transactions may differ depending on several
factors, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, cash on hand and differences from
our estimation of fees and expenses, as well as accrued interest on existing indebtedness.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under our Credit
Facilities, the net proceeds of the PIK Preferred Equity, the Sponsor Equity Contribution and cash on
hand to fund the Merger consideration, to retire certain existing indebtedness of the Company and to
pay related fees and expenses, as well as accrued interest on our outstanding debt.

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will
execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross
proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes into the applicable Escrow Account. The release of
escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the
Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, and upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the
purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue
date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in
respect of interest that would accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes
will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and
its affiliates will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a
special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that
are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory
redemption and the special mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

You should read the following together with the information under the headings “The
Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information” included elsewhere in this offering circular.

(1) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, the Company will enter into the Credit Facilities. The
full amount of the USD Term Loan Facility in the amount of $3,300 million and the Euro Term
Loan Facility in the amount of €930 million ($1,077 million equivalent based on an exchange rate
of 1.158 used for purposes of the Euro Term Loan Facility conversion) will be drawn on the
closing date to fund the Merger. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to

80


-----

$400 million from time to time and includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit. The Credit
Facilities will permit us to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility an amount up to $50 million to
finance the Merger plus additional amounts to fund OID or upfront fees. See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness.” We do not currently intend to draw any of the $50 million under the
Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so as a result of a decline
in cash on the balance sheet on or after the closing date, to fund additional fees or expenses or
for other reasons. Euro proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility will be swapped for U.S. dollars
on the closing date of the Merger, pursuant to certain foreign currency forward contracts.
(2) Represents the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered
hereby, consisting of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes, excluding any discounts and
commissions.
(3) Represents cash equity contributions associated with the issuance by Parent of $300 million of
PIK Preferred Equity, excluding issuance costs, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—PIK
Preferred Equity.”
(4) Represents cash equity contributions committed to be made by the Sponsor and the Rollover
Offer Participants to Parent, which will be contributed to Merger Sub in connection with the
Merger. See “The Transactions—The Merger.”
(5) Reflects (i) the estimate of the total consideration to be paid for the purchase of the Company’s
issued and outstanding common shares (other than the rollover equity of the Rollover Offer
Participants), (ii) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions of
approximately $170 million, not including the fees and expenses described in footnote (7) below,
and (iii) the repayment of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, including the third-party
indebtedness and all premiums, fees and expenses therewith. The actual purchase price of the
Company’s equity will depend on the adjustments to the Merger consideration immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger. See “The Transactions—The Merger.”

In connection with the Transactions, we intend to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under
the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain stock repurchase promissory notes.
As of March 31, 2018, we had the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3,603 million
aggregate principal amount in outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities,
approximately $1,840 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes outstanding and
approximately $7 million of stock repurchase promissory notes outstanding. In connection with
our repayment of outstanding indebtedness, we intend to pay a premium for the redemption of
and accrued interest on the Existing Notes and such stock repurchase promissory notes, which
totals approximately $89 million as of March 31, 2018. Depending on the timing of the closing of
the Transactions, the borrowings and accrued interest associated with the existing indebtedness
may vary. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes are lenders and/or agents
under the Existing Credit Facilities and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering through the repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit
Facilities if such funds are released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

As of March 31, 2018, we also had the following indebtedness outstanding: (i) $304 million
aggregate principal amount of Existing PIK Notes, which were fully redeemed during the quarter
ended June 30, 2018, and (ii) derivative instruments, (x) certain of which were terminated during
the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and (y) the remainder of which will mature prior to the
consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, such indebtedness will not be repaid in connection
with the Transactions, but will impact our cash and cash equivalents on a pro forma basis. See
“Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”
(6) Reflects (i) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Financing Transactions of
$222 million, including placement fees, initial purchaser discounts, underwriting and other
financing fees, our estimate of OID, and other transaction costs for advisory and professional

81

fees, and (ii) our estimated fees and expenses associated with the remainder of the Transactions
of $68 million, including PIK Preferred Equity issuance costs, fees paid to the Sponsor and other
transaction costs for advisory and professional fees. All fees, expenses and other costs are
estimates and actual amounts may differ from those set forth in this offering circular.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and capitalization as
of March 31, 2018 on an actual basis and on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions and
the use of proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds.” This table should be read with our
consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, “Use of Proceeds,” “The

(1) The available cash amount at closing will depend on the timing of the closing of the Transactions
and our cash generation and usage between March 31, 2018 and the closing date of the Merger.
Specifically, pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018 does not
reflect (i) changes in available cash that may occur prior to the closing of the Merger due to the
seasonality of our operations and (ii) a cash distribution anticipated to be made to our Existing
Sponsors prior to the closing of the Merger and not reflected as part of the Transactions. As a
result of these factors, we anticipate that our actual available cash amount as of the closing of the
Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected above on a pro forma basis and, as
reflected in “Use of Proceeds,” is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million.
(2) Excludes $31.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Existing Credit Facilities. The
Existing Credit Facilities provide for term loan borrowings, revolving loan borrowings and letters of
credit, guarantees and similar instruments. Any amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit
Facilities at the closing of the Transactions will be repaid in full, and the Existing Credit Facilities
will be terminated at such time.
(3) As of March 31, 2018, we had $303.9 million aggregate principal amount of Existing PIK Notes,
$1,775.0 million aggregate principal amount of Existing 2021 Notes, $37.5 million aggregate
principal amount of Existing February 2022 Notes and $27.8 million aggregate principal amount
of Existing December 2022 Notes. In May 2018, we issued a redemption notice to holders of the
Existing PIK Notes to redeem the remaining principal and interest outstanding thereof, which was
paid during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
(4) As of March 31, 2018, we had $24.3 million outstanding for capital leases and other obligations,
including (i) approximately $7.0 million of stock repurchase promissory notes, which will be repaid
in connection with the Transactions, and (ii) $9.3 million of accrued liabilities.

(5) On the closing date, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of lenders to
provide for borrowings of up to $400.0 million from time to time. We do not currently intend to
draw under the Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so as a
result of a decline in cash on the balance sheet on the closing date, to fund additional fees or
expenses or for other reasons. The Credit Facilities will permit us to draw up to $50.0 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance the Merger and additional amounts to fund OID and
upfront fees and expenses.
(6) Represents the full amount of the USD Term Loan Facility drawn on the closing date.
(7) Represents the full amount of the Euro Term Loan Facility drawn on the closing date. U.S. Dollar
equivalent based on USD:EUR exchange rate of 1.158 used for purposes of the Euro Term Loan
Facility conversion. Euro proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility will be swapped for U.S. dollars
on the closing date of the Merger, pursuant to certain foreign currency forward contracts.
(8) Represents the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes and
the Euro Notes offered hereby and does not reflect any discounts or commissions. The amount of
Euro Notes offered hereby is based on an exchange rate published by Bloomberg of $1.1610 per
€1.00 as of August 8, 2018.
(9) Pro forma total stockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2018 reflects the anticipated equity
contributions (i) to be made by Parent in connection with Parent’s issuance of PIK Preferred
Equity, (ii) to be made by the Sponsor and (iii) to be made by the Rollover Offer Participants, in
each case as part of the Transactions.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been
developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical audited consolidated financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2018.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations gives effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2017. All pro forma adjustments and the assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read
in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments reflected herein are preliminary and based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data is presented for informational purposes only. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data does not purport to represent what our
results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on
the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any
future period or as of any future date. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data
should be read in conjunction with the information included under “The Transactions,” “Use of
Proceeds,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this offering circular.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of
accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business
_Combinations, under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase_
price of an acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations are based on available information and certain
assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Management has made a preliminary allocation of the
estimated purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on various preliminary estimates. This estimate may differ materially from the actual allocation after the
completion of the Transactions. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon
the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information
available and our net assets on the closing date of the Transactions. In addition, this pro forma
presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits.
Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may
be material. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations does not reflect
any non-recurring charges or gains that we may record in connection with the Transactions; however,
these estimated non-recurring items will be reflected in our statement of operations for the period
during which the Transactions will take place.

The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of asset
and liability valuations. As of the date of this offering circular, we have not completed the valuation
studies necessary to finalize the estimates of the fair values of the assets we will acquire and liabilities
we will assume and the related allocation of the purchase price. We have allocated the total estimated
purchase price, calculated as described in note 2(e) to the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary
estimates of their fair values. A final determination of these fair values will reflect our consideration of a
final valuation, which may be prepared by third-party appraisers. There are no assurances that the final
estimate of fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will not be materially different from
the estimated fair value after a more detailed review is performed. This final valuation will be based on
the actual tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing

date of the Merger. Any final adjustment will change the allocations of purchase price, which could
affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, including a change to goodwill, a change to
the amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and a change to revenue. Any such
changes could differ materially from the valuations and purchase price allocations presented in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Note 1 – Basis of Presentation**

Effective May 25, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) with Banff Parent Inc. (“Parent”), Banff Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), Bain
Capital Private Equity, LP and Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc., pursuant to which, at the closing of the
transactions contemplated thereby, Parent, via Merger Sub, will acquire the Company and Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving the merger (the “Merger”).
Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of KKR & Co. Inc. (the “Sponsor”).

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Boxer Parent Company’s common
stock and all outstanding options to acquire Boxer Parent Company’s common stock will be cancelled
and converted into a right to receive cash consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Certain members of Boxer Parent Company’s management may agree to “roll over” a
percentage of their ownership of Boxer Parent Company’s common stock into Parent’s common stock.
The aggregate purchase price for the Company’s outstanding equity will be based on a base merger
consideration of $8,300.0 million in cash.

Parent has entered into a debt commitment letter with a syndicate of commercial banks to provide
up to $6.6 billion in financing, inclusive of the new senior secured U.S. dollar and Euro first lien term
loan facilities (collectively the “Term Loan Facilities”), the multicurrency senior secured first lien
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facilities, the
“Credit Facilities”) governed by a credit agreement and the Notes offered hereby, to fund the Merger.
Parent has also entered into a preferred equity commitment letter with investors to provide up to
$300.0 million of preferred equity of Parent (“PIK Preferred Equity”) to fund the Merger.

-----

The purchase price for the Merger is estimated as listed below. The purchase price will be
allocated to the fair value of the Company’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed, valued as of the
date of the Merger. The pro forma purchase price allocation below has been developed based on
preliminary estimates of fair value using the historical consolidated financial statements of the
Company as of March 31, 2018. In addition, the allocation of the purchase price to acquired identifiable
assets and assumed liabilities is based on management’s preliminary estimates of the values of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed used by management to
prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The pro forma
information will be revised based upon management’s final analyses, with the assistance of valuation
advisors, as additional information becomes available as of the closing date of the Merger and upon
the completion of purchase price adjustments. Such final adjustments, including changes to deferred
revenue and amortizable tangible and intangible assets, may be material. The preliminary purchase
price and purchase price allocation are presented as follows:

been allocated to goodwill. The estimated fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are
based on management’s best estimates for the preparation of the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial information and are subject to the final management analyses,
with the assistance of valuation advisors, at the completion of the Merger. The preliminary net

**Our Business**

We provide ITOM software solutions to help our customers monitor, manage, automate and
secure their mission-critical Information Technology (IT) workloads across hybrid environments,
whether mobile, multi-cloud, client-server or mainframe. Our customers use our portfolio of solutions to
help ensure seamless IT operations and performance across applications and infrastructure, including
new technologies that power their core business capabilities. Our solutions manage the IT systems
and processes that enable mission-critical business functions such as processing payment
transactions at global financial institutions, managing global airline reservations, check-in and
departure processes at scale in real-time, ensuring consistent inventory and pricing data across online
and brick and-mortar storefronts, as well as controlling and intelligently optimizing HVAC across vast
global corporate footprints. We have a culture of innovation and have consistently invested in and
delivered modern solutions that address our customers’ evolving IT requirements. As IT paradigms
have expanded from mainframe, to client server, to mobile, to cloud, we have remained a trusted
provider of solutions for our customers’ important IT challenges. We were founded in 1980 as a
mainframe management software provider and we have consistently developed innovative solutions,
leveraged new technologies and techniques, responded to the evolving needs of our customers and
expanded our portfolio.

We license our software under both perpetual and term license models for on-premises use.
Under perpetual license arrangements, our customers receive the perpetual right to use our software.
Many of our customers also purchase related maintenance and support services on an annual or multi
97


-----

year basis. Under term license arrangements, our customers receive license rights to use our software
along with bundled maintenance and support services for the term of the contract. We also provide
on-demand Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and managed services offerings delivered through hosted
solutions.

We are able to provide ITOM solutions at the scale and sophistication required by the world’s
largest organizations. Our large, diverse base of more than 10,000 customers spans over 120
countries and a broad range of industries, including major banks, financial services firms, government
agencies, technology companies, telecommunication providers, manufacturers, educational
institutions, retailers and hospitals. We have approximately 5,800 employees worldwide as of
March 31, 2018 with offices across 39 countries. We market and sell our solutions primarily through a
direct sales force, augmented by strategic alliances with channel partners, including resellers,
distributors and systems integrators.

Because our software and SaaS solutions and related professional services are designed for and
marketed to companies looking to improve the management of their IT infrastructure and processes,
the demand for our solutions and services, and therefore our financial results, are dependent upon
customers continuing to value such solutions and to invest in such technology. There are a number of
trends that have historically influenced demand for IT management solutions, including, among others,
business demands placed on IT, computing capacity within IT departments, complexity of IT systems,
IT operational costs and the growth of SaaS and cloud solutions within the IT industry which in some
cases is displacing on-premises software licensing installations. Our financial results are also
influenced by many economic and industry conditions, including, but not limited to, general economic
and market conditions in the United States and global markets in which we operate and market our
solutions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, general levels of customer spending, IT
budgets, the competitiveness of the IT management software and solutions industry and the stability of
the mainframe market.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Performance**

**_Cycle of Customer Contracts Coming Up for Renewal_**

A large portion of our revenue is generated from the renewal of our existing contracts. The timing
and occurrence of these renewals is impacted by several factors including the contract terms that
determine when they come up for renewal, competitive offerings and the evolving business needs of
our customers. Additionally, significant new product sale opportunities occur in connection with our
contract renewal cycles. These factors may increase the volatility of our operating results.

**_Retention of and Expansion Within Our Existing Customer Base_**

Expanding the relationships with our existing customers has been an important part of our growth
strategy. Over the years, our innovation efforts have been focused on solving the critical IT problems of
our customers, demonstrating a strong sense of commitment towards the success of their businesses.
Our sales efforts are focused on: (a) retention and expansion within our current customer base, driven
through renewals, additional capacity and cross-selling opportunities and (b) sale of our integrated
product portfolio to new customers.

We believe our ability to cross-sell is a key factor in our efforts to further penetrate our existing
customer base. Our large, diverse base of more than 10,000 customers spans over 120 countries.
After the initial deployment of our solutions, many of our customers expand their usage of our solutions
to manage more workloads. Our future growth and profitability depend on our ability to successfully
expand the adoption and usage of our solutions within our customers’ organizations.

98


-----

**_Sales Performance_**

With a focus on long-term growth, we have developed a disciplined sales strategy and made
significant investments in our sales force. We focus our Sales and Go-to-Market strategies on our large
enterprise customers. We have a strong focus on cross-selling and upselling existing customers,
maintaining high customer satisfaction and winning new customers. We have introduced specialized
account managers who have deep technical experience and are key contributors for driving our crossselling efforts.

**_Investments in New Product Development_**

Our continued focus on new product development has helped us remain competitive in the
market. We continue to develop innovative products that are used by our customers to solve many of
their most important IT challenges. Amidst changing environments and a proliferation of data, our
solutions help many of our customers manage costs while improving the performance of their IT
infrastructures. Our customer-centric innovation efforts are aimed to ensure a long-lasting relationship
with our customers.

**_Mix of Subscription and Perpetual Licenses and Associated Accounting Impact_**

We offer our customers the flexibility to choose between perpetual and time-based licenses, as
well on-premises deployments and hosted SaaS solutions. Over time, the share of time-based licenses
and SaaS subscriptions has increased relative to perpetual licenses and we expect this trend to
continue in the future. This mix-shift will impact the timing of revenue recognition and renewals which
can impact revenue adversely over the short term. Time-based license fees and SaaS subscription
fees are recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the subscription arrangements beginning on
the date the license or service is made available to the customer. This accounting methodology leads
to recognition of a portion of revenue in a period derived from agreements that were entered into in
prior periods and hence does not fully reflect our sales performance. On the other hand, perpetual
license revenue is generally recognized upfront upon execution of the contract and delivery of the
licenses, or ratably over the associated maintenance and support term, based on the application of
GAAP to the particular contract terms. There is inherent unpredictability in the timing of recognition of
perpetual license revenue due to contractual terms that may be included in individual customer
contracts, which may cause significant fluctuations in our revenue and earnings from quarter to
quarter. In addition, we are continuing to assess the potential effects of Topic 606 and we currently
anticipate that the volatility of our revenue and earnings period to period will increase upon our
adoption of Topic 606. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Recent Accounting
Pronouncements.”

**_Items Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations_**

As a result of the application of purchase accounting in connection with the 2013 Acquisition, our
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were adjusted to their respective fair values. This had a
significant effect on our deferred revenue balances and reduced future amounts that would have been
recognized in our current and prior periods into revenue from deferred revenue. As such, to aid
comparability, certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of purchase
accounting, are included herein and are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measure
in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” herein.

**_Effects of the Transactions on our Financial Statements_**

The consummation of the Merger and related transactions, the repayment of the Existing Credit
Facilities, the discharge or defeasance of the Existing Notes, the payment of related fees and
expenses and the Financing Transactions will have effects on our financial statements in the future.
See “The Transactions” for a description of the Merger and the Financing Transactions.

99


-----

Our financial statements in the future will vary from the historical financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering circular. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using
the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations,
under GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price of an
acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values. Such valuations will be based on available information and certain
assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates, industry outlook and other factors that we
believe are reasonable. The most significant effects to our financial statements are expected to be the
reduction of deferred revenue balances to their estimated fair values, which will also reduce the
amount of revenue recognized in future periods to the extent it was deferred at the date of the Merger;
adjustments to intangible asset amounts and the associated estimated useful lives, which may
increase the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods; adjustments to goodwill
balances, which may increase the risk of an impairment in future periods; and the associated tax
impacts of these changes.

**_Revenue_**

We license our software under both perpetual and term license models for customer on-premises
use. Under perpetual license arrangements, our customers receive the perpetual license rights to use
our software and generally purchase related maintenance and support services for a specified period.
Under term license arrangements, our customers receive license rights to use our software along with

-----

bundled maintenance and support services for the term of the contract. We also provide on-demand
SaaS offerings for certain of our products, which provide management solutions through a hosted
service rather than a traditional on-premises license model.

As a result of the application of purchase accounting in connection with the 2013 Acquisition,
deferred perpetual license, deferred perpetual maintenance and SaaS, deferred term license and
maintenance and deferred professional services revenue balances were adjusted to their fair values.
These adjustments had the effect of reducing future amounts that would have been recognized into
revenue from deferred revenue. To aid comparability, non-GAAP revenue information is provided
herein to reflect revenue that would have been recognized had purchase accounting not been applied
in connection with the 2013 Acquisition.

The following table and discussion summarize revenue on a non-GAAP basis which excludes the
impact of purchase accounting applied in connection with the 2013 Acquisition:

_Perpetual License Revenue (non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of purchase accounting)_

Non-GAAP perpetual license revenue in fiscal 2018 was $358.7 million, a decrease of
$15.3 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2017. This decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in the
amount of perpetual license transaction bookings recognized upfront rather than deferred and a
decrease in perpetual license transaction bookings, partially offset by an increase in the recognition of
non-GAAP perpetual license revenue that was deferred in prior periods. Of the perpetual license
transactions recorded, the percentage of perpetual license revenue deferred rather than recognized
upfront was 35% in the current fiscal year as compared to 32% in the prior fiscal year.

Non-GAAP perpetual license revenue in fiscal 2017 was $374.0 million, a decrease of
$8.0 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2016. This decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in the
amount of perpetual license transaction bookings recognized upfront rather than deferred, partially
offset by an increase in the recognition of non-GAAP perpetual license revenue that was deferred in
prior periods. Of the perpetual license transactions recorded, the percentage of perpetual license
revenue deferred rather than recognized upfront was 32% in the current fiscal year as compared to
29% in the prior fiscal year.

_Perpetual Maintenance and SaaS Revenue (non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of purchase_
_accounting)_

Non-GAAP perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue for fiscal 2018 was $953.2 million, an
increase of $29.4 million, or 3.2%, over fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable primarily to an
increase in the recognition of non-GAAP maintenance revenue that was deferred in prior periods and
an increase in non-GAAP SaaS revenue due to an increased subscriber base.

101


-----

Non-GAAP perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue for fiscal 2017 was $923.8 million, an
increase of $31.2 million, or 3.5%, over fiscal 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an
increase in the recognition of non-GAAP maintenance revenue that was deferred in prior periods and
an increase in non-GAAP SaaS revenue due to an increased subscriber base.

Non-GAAP SaaS revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $92.7 million, $82.3 million and
$67.2 million, respectively.

_Term License and Maintenance Revenue (non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of purchase_
_accounting)_

Non-GAAP term license and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2018 was $503.4 million, an increase
of $43.9 million, or 9.6%, over fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in term licenses. Non-GAAP
term license and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2017 was $459.5 million, an increase of $29.1 million,
or 6.8%, over fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in term licenses.

fees. Refer to Note 9 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

**_Other Expense, Net_**

Other expense, net, consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding borrowings, foreign
currency gains and losses, interest earned and realized gains and losses on investments. Other
expense, net, for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $522.0 million, $405.8 million and $438.3 million,
respectively.

Other expense, net, for fiscal 2018 increased by $116.2 million, or 28.6%, over fiscal 2017,
attributable to a $94.9 million increase in losses on derivative instruments, $15.9 million of fees
associated with the credit agreement amendments and a $32.6 million increase in loss on
extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a $13.6 million increase in net foreign currency gains, a

106


-----

Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by amounts
recorded to reflect the provisional impacts of the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal
corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. For our fiscal 2018 tax year, we utilized a
blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 31.5% based on the weighted average daily tax rate. The
Tax Act also contains multiple other provisions impacting us, including the creation of a territorial-style
tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries
(the “Transition Tax”) as well as other provisions that we will continue to evaluate in future periods. As
a result of the Tax Act, we recorded the following provisional amounts that resulted in a net charge of
$108.4 million recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018: (i) a $175.7 million charge related to
the Transition Tax, net of Transition Tax-related foreign tax credits; (ii) a $76.2 million valuation
allowance on foreign tax credits that are not expected to be utilized because of changes to the
international tax provisions of the Tax Act; and (iii) an offsetting $143.5 million benefit resulting from the
remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. based on the new lower federal corporate tax
rate.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 was impacted by a decrease in the
valuation allowance of approximately $66.1 million, primarily due to changes in estimates of the
utilization of foreign tax credits and our income tax benefit was further impacted by tax expense
associated with the patent litigation settlement proceeds received in April 2016 (see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, on October 11, 2016, the Spanish Supreme Court
rendered an unfavorable ruling against the Company regarding Spanish Non Resident Income Tax
derived from payments carried out by Spanish tax resident customers. As a result, the Company
recorded additional tax expense of approximately $15 million, including related penalties and interest,
during the year ended March 31, 2017.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations**

The audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management and Board of Directors also evaluate our
results of operations based on various non-GAAP financial measures. The primary non-GAAP financial
measures we focus on in evaluating our performance are: (i) non-GAAP revenue and (ii) Non-GAAP
EBITDA. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not
been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP revenue represents total revenue excluding the
effect of purchase accounting adjustments to the fair value of deferred revenue existing on the 2013
Acquisition Date. Non-GAAP EBITDA excludes other expense (net); income taxes; depreciation and
amortization expenses; share-based compensation expense; severance, restructuring and other costs;
sponsor management fees; patent litigation costs; gain on patent litigation, net; certain legal,
settlement and related costs; and the impact of purchase accounting for the 2013 Acquisition. A
reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial
measure is included below.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful
supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude certain material
non-cash items and certain other adjustments for items that management and the Board of Directors
do not consider part of core operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, and
for consistency with the manner in which our operating subsidiary, BSFI, reports its operating results in
its periodic reporting to its lenders under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, we believe these
non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of
supplemental information used by management and the Board of Directors.

While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental
information, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. These

107


-----

non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a
comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items
that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures, such as those described above, can have a
material impact on net income (loss). As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow from operations or
other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these
limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures
and by reconciling each non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.

(1) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense
associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the
Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for
the 2013 Acquisition. This adjustment related to deferred costs and other expenses for fiscal
2018, 2017 and 2016 excludes $7.7 million, $30.2 million and $61.6 million, respectively, of
non-GAAP amortization expense related to the pre-2013 Acquisition capitalization of software
development costs for internally developed products that would have been recognized in these
periods, which has no impact on EBITDA.
(2) Represents share-based compensation expense related to the granting of share-based awards to
key employees by the Company.
(3) Primarily represents severance, restructuring and other costs, and any subsequent changes in
estimates to cost accruals, related to initiatives taken to reduce our cost structure and enhance
operating effectiveness, improve profitability and eliminate certain redundancies. These activities
impacted different functional areas of our operations in different locations and were undertaken to
meet specific business objectives. Other costs also include acquisition integration costs,
expenses associated with the Company’s adoption of new accounting standards, professional
fees associated with a potential transaction and non-cash adjustments to estimated contingent
consideration for an acquisition.
(4) Represents amounts paid to the Existing Sponsors pursuant to the terms of the Existing Sponsor
Advisory Agreement that will be terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger.
Accordingly, following the termination fee payable in connection with the Merger, no additional
sponsor management fee will be payable under the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement.
(5) Represents third-party legal fees and other costs incurred to protect the Company’s intellectual
property.
(6) Represents proceeds received as a result of the confidential settlement agreement entered into
during the year ended March 31, 2017 with ServiceNow, Inc. to resolve the patent infringement

As of March 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and similar instruments of
approximately $54.9 million (including $31.7 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement), primarily
in support of performance obligations to various customers, but also related to facilities and other
obligations.

As of March 31, 2018, we had $563.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash,
approximately 65% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and was largely generated from
our international operations. As a result of the Tax Act, amounts held by our international subsidiaries
are generally no longer subject to U.S. taxes upon repatriation to the United States.

We also had an additional $310.0 million in borrowing capacity available under a revolving credit
facility (subject to limitations based on a maximum first lien net leverage ratio, as defined), of which
$31.7 million is committed to support outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and similar instruments.
Refer to Note 5 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering circular for
more information regarding our outstanding indebtedness and revolving credit facility.

The Existing Credit Facilities will be repaid and terminated upon consummation of the Merger.

In May 2018, the Company issued a redemption notice to holders of the Existing PIK Notes to
redeem the remaining principal and interest outstanding under the Existing PIK Notes of $309.6 million,
which was paid during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.

In May 2018, the Company paid $19.2 million to terminate a U.S. cross currency swap and a
deferred premium currency call option.

The Existing Notes will be discharged or defeased upon consummation of the Merger.

**_Post-Transactions_**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, our principal sources of liquidity will be our
existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our Credit
Facilities.

We expect that our primary liquidity requirements will be for debt service, working capital, capital
expenditures and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses. Our ability to make scheduled
payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our operations and capital expenditure
requirements depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which in turn are subject
to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors
beyond our control. While we can offer no assurances, we believe that our existing cash balances,
funds generated from operating activities and available credit will be sufficient to meet our working and
other capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in control, we could be
required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance any of our
indebtedness, including our Credit Facilities and the Notes offered hereby, on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions may require
additional capital and any such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will continue to be significantly leveraged. As of
March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
outstanding indebtedness of $6,219.1 million, including the €301.5 million Euro Notes and the
$1,475.0 million Dollar Notes offered hereby, our USD Term Loan Facility in the principal amount of
$3,300.0 million, the Euro Term Loan Facility in the principal amount of €930.0 million and other debt
of $17.2 million. Additionally, we would have had availability under our Revolving Credit Facility of
$400.0 million (excluding $31.7 million of outstanding letters of credit). Upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including but not limited to, the agreement of lenders to provide such facilities or
commitments, we will also have the option, subject to certain conditions, to add one or more
incremental term loan or revolving credit facilities or increase commitments under our Revolving Credit
Facility, in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the sum of (a) the greater of (i) $700.0 million and (ii)
85% of Consolidated EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to the credit agreement that will govern the
Credit Facilities) and (b) the aggregate amount of voluntary prepayments of loans and voluntary
commitment reductions (in each case, to the extent not funded with the proceeds of long-term debt),
plus (ii) an additional unlimited amount subject to compliance with certain leverage-based criteria set
forth in the Credit Facilities. The indenture governing the Notes will allow for even greater “incremental”
secured debt capacity than permitted under the Credit Facilities.

For a more detailed description of the Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness,” and for a more detailed description of the Notes offered hereby, see “Description of
Notes.”

March 31, 2017 would be $371.1 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 of $77.9 million
reflects the net loss from operations, adjusted for the impact of non-cash income and expenses, as
well as the net impact of working capital changes. During the year ended March 31, 2016, cash flows
from operating activities include the impact of cash payments related to share-based awards. On a
non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of these payments, net cash provided by operating activities for

monitoring agreement remains subject to negotiation. See “Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions.”

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an
on-going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, capitalized software development costs, share-based compensation, goodwill and
intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience
and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the
carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and such estimates may
change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change.

114


-----

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We derive revenue principally from software-related arrangements consisting of software license
and maintenance offerings, non-software arrangements consisting of our SaaS offerings as well as the
associated professional services for each of these types of arrangements. We recognize revenue when
all of the following core revenue recognition criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the license or service has occurred; (iii) the arrangement fee is fixed
or determinable and (iv) collection of the arrangement fee is probable.

_Software License and Maintenance Arrangements_

Software license revenue is recognized upfront on perpetual license sales when the core revenue
recognition criteria above are satisfied and vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value
of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple-element
arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use
the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual
method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those
elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We
have established VSOE of the fair value of our maintenance offerings through independent
maintenance renewals. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a
percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of
the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand-alone
basis, as well as management-approved pricing for certain new offerings.

We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain
arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is
based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list
prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements in certain
arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to
future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one
or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery
of those elements or when VSOE of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements, or if the
deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the longest
expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is typically the longest
maintenance term.

In our time-based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value of
undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements
are the same duration as the license terms, and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be
established. Accordingly, license and maintenance fees in time-based license arrangements are
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements and are included in term license and
maintenance revenue in the statements of comprehensive loss.

Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the maintenance
arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years and in some instances, can extend up to
five or more years.

_Professional Services Arrangements_

Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and
education services associated with our products, is derived under both time-and-material and fixed fee
arrangements. In most fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized on a proportional performance
basis based on days of effort. If no discernible customer deliverable exists until the completion of the

115


-----

professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of
professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed
completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license
arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not
involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise
considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the
professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined
software license and professional services revenue is recognized based on contract accounting using
either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.

_SaaS Arrangements_

SaaS subscription fees are recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the subscription
arrangements beginning on the date that the service is made available to customers. Additional
professional services fees, principally related to optional services engagements that are not essential
to the functionality of our core SaaS offerings and are considered to have stand-alone value, are
generally recognized on a proportional performance basis based on days of effort. In our consolidated
statements of comprehensive loss, SaaS subscription revenue and optional professional services
revenue are included in perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue and professional services revenue,
respectively.

_Other Revenue Recognition Considerations_

In arrangements containing both software and non-software (e.g., SaaS) elements, which to date
have been infrequent, we allocate the arrangement consideration first into software and non-software
units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy and then apply the applicable software
and non-software revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting. To date, we have determined
the relative selling price of software and non-software units of accounting based on management’s
best estimate of selling price as other means of determining relative selling price (e.g., VSOE or other
third-party evidence) have not been available with respect to all of the components in bundled software
and non-software arrangements.

We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators
(collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions
with the end users of our products and services. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel
partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return or price protection to any of our
channel partners.

Revenue from financed customer transactions are generally recognized in the same manner as
those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers
and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements
where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments
become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or
a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received.

We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not
included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are invoiced and relieve the
liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency.

In our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, revenue is categorized as perpetual
license, perpetual maintenance and SaaS, term license and maintenance or professional services
revenue. We allocate revenue from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these

116


-----

categories based on the VSOE of fair value of the elements in each revenue arrangement and the
application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value
of all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value of
all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair
value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair
value has not been established based upon management’s best estimate of fair value of those
undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Management’s best
estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is
based upon the VSOE of the fair value of similar offerings and other objective criteria.

**_Software Development Costs_**

Costs of software developed internally for licensing to third parties are expensed until the
technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software
development costs are capitalized until the product is generally available to customers in accordance
with relevant accounting standards. Judgment is involved in determining the point at which
technological feasibility is reached. If different judgments were made, they could result in a different
amount of costs that are capitalized. Costs of software developed using agile development methods
are generally expensed as incurred because the development efforts between technological feasibility
and general release of the software products are insignificant. Capitalized software development costs
are then amortized using the greater of an amount determined by the ratio of current revenues
recognized to the total anticipated revenues for a product or straight-line over the product’s estimated
economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. We evaluate
our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized
balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any
such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the period in which it is identified.
Determining net realizable value requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the
appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the sales of software products
could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in
significant increases to our depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of the impairment of
capitalized software development costs.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

The Company has issued stock options to its executives and other employees which primarily
vest in annual increments over four or five years, with a term of ten years. These grants typically
consist of stock options that are half time-based (the time-vesting options) and half which contain
service, performance and market conditions (the performance-vesting options). The time-vesting
options vest in annual increments assuming continued employment, with accelerated vesting in the
event of a change of control. The performance-vesting options also vest in annual increments,
assuming continued employment, the occurrence of a liquidity event and the achievement of target
investor returns. Additionally, there are provisions for partial vesting for both time-vesting and
performance-vesting options in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances as set
forth in the terms of the award. The options are exercisable for Class B non-voting common stock. Both
the time-vesting options and the performance-vesting options contain certain repurchase features that
allow the Company to repurchase shares acquired by the employee through the exercise of the
options, contingent upon the employee’s separation from the Company.

The fair value of our common stock is used to value our share-based awards, establish the
exercise price for future option grants and establish the price paid by the Company to repurchase
shares acquired by former employees through the exercise of stock options upon the employee’s
separation from the Company, after six months from the date of exercise.

117


-----

The fair values of the Company’s common stock were approved by the Compensation Committee
of our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations,
which were performed at least annually. If stock options were granted a short period of time prior to the
date of a valuation report, we retrospectively assessed the fair value used for financial reporting
purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts
and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below.

Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-HeldCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the “AICPA Guide”), management exercised
reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best
estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:

‰ The results of contemporaneous valuations of our common stock by unrelated third parties;

‰ Market multiples of comparable public companies in our industry as indicated by their market
capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions;

‰ Our performance and market position relative to our competitors, who may change from time to
time;

‰ Our historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for our future performance;
and

‰ The economic and competitive environment in which we operate.

The fair value of our common stock was determined using the average of the income and market
approach valuation methods to estimate the Company’s enterprise value and then adjusting the
enterprise value for net debt adjustments to estimate the Company’s equity value. There have been no
secondary sales of our common stock or other transactions that may indicate the fair value of the
common stock in an orderly market transaction. The income approach estimates value based on the
expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted
to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to
reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a
comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From
the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to
the subject company’s financial forecasts to estimate the value of the subject company.

The fair value of an individual share of our common stock was derived by dividing the Company’s
equity value by the number of outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. The fair
values of our Class A and Class B common stock were the same because holders of Class A common
stock and Class B common stock participate equally in dividends and liquidation proceeds of the
Company. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000 shares of preferred stock and to
fix the voting powers, designations, powers, preferences and other rights of the preferred stock. No
value has been attributed to the preferred shares because no shares of preferred stock have been
issued and the rights of the preferred shares have not been established.

Application of the valuation methods involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions
that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue,
expenses and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies
and the probability of future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the
relationships between those assumptions, impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may
have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.

**_Fair Value of Share-Based Awards_**

Share-based compensation costs for time-vesting options are based on the fair value calculated
from the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of grant and for the performance-vesting
options, are based on the grant-date fair value calculated from the Monte Carlo simulation model. The
grant-date fair values of the time-vesting options are recorded as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the entire vesting period of the awards, with an evaluation done on each vesting date to
true up the expense, if necessary, to at least equal the grant-date fair value of the vested portion of the
award. The performance-vesting options are expensed using the accelerated method over the vesting
period.

We estimate the expected volatility of our common stock using similar public entities’ historical
volatility (as well as BMC’s historical volatility as a public company), adjusted for the Company’s capital
structure, for a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the options. The expected term
of the options granted has been derived using the simplified method, which calculates the expected
term as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term, as the Company
does not have sufficient historical exercise data. We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on yields
of U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity corresponding to the expected term of the options. We
assume a dividend yield of zero, as there is no intent to pay future dividends.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended March 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016 was $116.38, $103.29 and $52.78, respectively.

**_Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase consideration is typically allocated to
acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The
excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired
technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the date of any
such acquisition. We amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over
their estimated useful lives. The estimation of acquisition-date fair values of intangible assets and their
useful lives requires us to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to an evaluation
of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, projections of
future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.

We assess goodwill for impairment as of January 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced
below its carrying value. When conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a three
step process. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, using an
assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, we are required to
make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic
conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future
financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they

119


-----

operate. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for
impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we
perform a second step for that reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill
impairment. This quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit
and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, determined using a combination of the
income and market approaches on an invested capital basis, to its respective carrying value (including
goodwill) as of the date of the impairment test. The third step, employed for any reporting unit that fails
the second step, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied
fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill. If a reporting unit’s carrying value is
negative, the Company does not follow this three-step process, and instead performs a qualitative
evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired. If
we determine it is more likely than not impaired, the third step discussed above is performed to
determine if there is an impairment and measure the amount of any potential impairment.

Assumptions, judgments and estimates about fair values are complex and often subjective and
can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends,
and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we
believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates used in determining the fair values of intangible
assets, the associated useful lives and the fair values of our reporting units are reasonable and
appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect the fair value or
useful lives of our intangible assets and our goodwill impairment assessment, which could result in
future impairment charges and those charges could be material to our results of operations.

**_Accounting for Income Taxes_**

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax
bases, along with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Income taxes include U.S. and
foreign income taxes, including U.S. federal taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to
the extent such earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that
is more likely than not to be realized.

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of
being sustained. We utilize a “more likely than not” threshold for the recognition and derecognition of
tax positions and measure positions accordingly. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in
the period in which the change in judgment occurs, which can be caused by the closing of a tax audit,
judicial rulings, expirations of the statute of limitations or refinements of estimates based on changing
facts or circumstances. We recognize interest and penalties within income tax benefit in our
consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the
ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate
tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and
cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities and the process of identifying items of
revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment. We are subject to corporate income tax
audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy
income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in
these jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of
these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and
accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision (benefit) and net
earnings (loss) in the period in which such determination is made.

120


-----

During the year ended March 31, 2017, we did not consider any of our foreign subsidiaries’
earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As a result of the Tax Act, we
re-evaluated our assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment and for the year ended March 31, 2018,
the temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on
projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based
on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide
appropriate jurisdictional taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our
effective tax rate.

In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable
income in those jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market
growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we
operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation
allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to
earnings in the period in which we make such determination.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments in 2015,
2016 and 2017 (collectively, Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes nearly all revenue recognition guidance
under previously existing GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when
promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to
achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is likely that more judgment and estimates may be
required within the revenue recognition process than are required under previously existing GAAP,
including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs
related to obtaining customer contracts and requires enhanced disclosures. Topic 606 is effective for
public companies beginning the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 and for nonpublic companies beginning
the first quarter of our fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. Topic 606 may be applied
retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective method) or with the cumulative effect
recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We anticipate adopting
Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the full retrospective method.

While the Company is continuing to determine the full impact of Topic 606, it currently anticipates
the standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures,
and believes the most significant effect relates to the timing of the recognition of software license
revenue. Specifically, under Topic 606, the Company currently expects to recognize substantially all
software license revenue, in both perpetual licensing and term licensing arrangements, at the point in
time the licensed software is transferred to the customer. This represents a substantial change to our
application of previously existing GAAP, under which a substantial portion of our perpetual license
revenue and all of our term license revenue is generally deferred and recognized ratably, most
commonly over the term of the associated maintenance arrangements but in some cases over the
longest expected delivery period of other undelivered elements in the arrangement. As a result, the
Company also anticipates a significant reduction in deferred license revenue upon adoption of Topic
606, principally relating to the cumulative earlier recognition of deferred license revenue recognized
upon software transfer to our customers. The Company currently believes that the point-in-time
recognition requirement of Topic 606 will increase the volatility of its revenue and earnings period to

121


-----

period. The Company does not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on the timing of
revenue recognition for its maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts.

Under Topic 606, a larger portion of the Company’s sales commissions and other incremental
costs to acquire contracts will be subject to capitalization as compared to our application of previously
existing GAAP. However, incremental costs related to software license deliverables will be expensed
as incurred whereas under our application of current GAAP, a portion of such costs are capitalized and
amortized commensurate with the timing of software license revenue recognition. Additionally, the
Company currently anticipates that it will amortize incremental costs related to new customer business
over an expected period of benefit of approximately five years, which is generally longer than
amortization periods utilized under our application of previously existing GAAP. The Company is
currently assessing the potential financial statement impact of these new requirements.

The Company is also currently assessing the income tax impacts related to Topic 606, mostly
relating to the potential impacts from earlier recognition of revenue and the associated reduction in
deferred revenue under the standard. Subject to the Company’s overall tax attributes and other factors,
the adoption of Topic 606 could result in an increase in income taxes payable and accelerated cash tax
payment requirements in periods subsequent to adoption of the standard in comparison to existing tax
treatment.

We do not believe Topic 606 will have a material impact on the timing of our customer contract
billings and cash receipts, and thus on our operating or free cash flows, other than the potential tax
impacts noted above.

**Our Industry**

The ITOM industry is seeing continued growth driven by the challenges facing large enterprises
(cost containment, compliance and evolving business demands / need for continuous optimization) and
several technology trends. These trends include the growing strategic importance of IT, the increasing
complexity of enterprise IT architectures, the increasing challenges enterprises face in managing IT
operations and the persistence of mainframe as a core computing platform. Taken together, these
trends underpin the technology tailwinds driving the growth of integrated ITOM software platforms.

‰ Market Opportunity. We believe that the global ITOM market represented over $25 billion of
spend in 2017 and is expected to grow to over $38 billion of spend in 2022, representing a
CAGR of approximately 7% to 8%. This projected market growth represents an opportunity for
us to expand our services and revenues within the ITOM market. For additional information,
see “Market, Ranking and Other Industry Data.”

‰ Growing Strategic Importance of IT. The global digitization of business has evolved IT from
a supporting function to a core capability for many of today’s leading enterprises. How well a
business can build, deliver and manage IT drives its ability to offer differentiated services and
compete effectively in the global and online business environment. This evolution has elevated
the strategic importance of IT resources in many enterprises and increased the scope of the
digital services such enterprises are expected to deliver and manage.

‰ Increasing Complexity of Enterprise IT Architectures. From mainframe to client-server
architecture to mobile and multi-cloud to IoT devices, the evolution of new technologies over
the past several decades has expanded the scope of IT. These new technologies often are
being deployed alongside existing infrastructure, necessitating the inclusion of operations
management in almost all IT disciplines to run a secure and performing business. The
compounding complexity of modern IT architectures — coupled with the proliferation of data
and increasing transaction volumes — strains IT resources and requires new solutions that
enable businesses to manage their IT infrastructures securely and efficiently.

‰ Enterprises **_Face_** **_Increasing_** **_Challenges_** **_in_** **_Managing_** **_IT_** **_Operations._** Modern IT
organizations often need to manage disparate types of computing architectures and
deployment models including multi-cloud, hybrid and on-premises. They also must maintain
performance and availability of technology infrastructure to run mission-critical workloads and
dynamically scale IT services to growing business demands. The resulting heterogeneity of
modern IT environments has made managing IT operations a complex task for IT
professionals. Key challenges include:

       - managing increasing complexity of business services running across heterogeneous,
multi-cloud infrastructure;

       - securing the IT infrastructure by tracking compliance to identify, prioritize and remediate
vulnerabilities;

       - containing the total cost of ownership of IT infrastructure;

       - identifying, locating and monitoring all IT assets within complex, multi-cloud
environments;

125


-----

       - enabling agile software development and IT operations so that organizations can build,
deploy and scale applications at faster speeds; and

       - increasing efficiency, including limiting downtime, accelerating speed of delivering new
services and providing faster incident resolution.

‰ Persistence of Mainframe as a Core Computing Platform. Mainframes are powerful servers,
capable of processing large numbers of transactions simultaneously, while supporting
thousands of applications, users and devices and operating with near perfect uptime. Superior
speed, security and reliability constitute the core value proposition of the mainframe and
differentiate the platform from other IT infrastructures such as distributed networks or cloud.
Transaction processing, data retrieval and records management are among the most missioncritical mainframe workloads.

For many of the world’s largest companies, the mainframe is and will continue to be a critical
part of their IT infrastructure. Data-sensitive industries such as financial services and
governments require the mainframe’s superior security features, and large companies with very
high transaction volumes, such as commercial banks, retailers and airlines, rely on the speed
and reliability of the mainframe. The central role mainframe servers play in modern IT
infrastructure, the risk involved in moving mission critical workloads off the mainframe and the
lack of viable alternatives for key use cases create significant barriers to migrating from the
platform.

Secular trends such as the growth of mobile transactions, proliferation of digital data and
increased connectivity between IT infrastructure and endpoints are creating growth in
mainframe usage. Organizations are expanding their mainframe computing capacity, measured
in MIPS to effectively manage these additional demands. The global installed base of MIPS
has more than doubled over the last 10 years. A third-party survey found that the majority of
mainframe users expect mainframe spend to increase annually over the next five years.

**Growing Mainframe Installed Base**

Today’s mainframe installed base is committed to the platform, with over 90% of respondents to
BMC’s 2017 annual mainframe survey predicting the long-term viability of the platform and over 70% of
large shops indicating their MIPS usage has grown over the past three years. Due to the size and the
nature of their businesses, these customers have limited alternatives that will support mission-critical
functions with the requisite level of reliability and security.

**_IT Service Management is Growing Quickly_**

Modern IT requires fast, reliable service and support for a wide variety of applications, business
services, and devices deployed across diverse systems including multiple virtualized environments.
These disparate systems are increasingly being accessed by end users from a multitude of locations
using a variety of different devices. Further IT complexity requires increasingly integrated, accessible
solutions capable of operating across a variety of IT environments. Providing competitive service levels
is key to achieving the desired experience for end users.

An ITSM platform is the central “portal” through which IT interacts with and ensures the overall
health of the IT infrastructure. The platform improves IT service as perceived by business end-users,
drives improvements in efficiency through application of best practices and drives down costs by
helping end-users solve their own problems, reducing the number of calls to the service desk.
Cognitive capabilities allow the solutions to scale alongside the rapidly expanding IT footprints of the
world’s largest organizations without driving a proportionate increase in support headcount.

‰ Business Model Driven by Recurring Revenue and Renewals. We derive the majority of our
revenue from fixed duration maintenance contracts, term licenses and SaaS arrangements,
which have provided a steady and visible revenue stream. We define recurring revenue as
non-GAAP revenue, excluding professional services revenue and perpetual license revenue.
During the year ended March 31, 2018, we generated approximately 76% of our non-GAAP
revenue from recurring revenue sources, compared to 63% for the year ended March 31, 2013,
in each case on a constant currency basis. Our software solutions are mission-critical and
deeply embedded within the IT infrastructure, which drives high switching costs given the
disruptive, time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of new enterprise installations. Some
of our products have been embedded in customers’ IT infrastructure for over a decade, making
them expensive and risky to replace. Furthermore, our significant domain expertise enables a
high level of end-user customization, further entrenching customers in our solutions and
making switching even more difficult.

vendor and to our market leading multi-cloud and hybrid solutions today, we have
consistently invested in innovation and developing solutions in areas of strategic
significance for our customers. As our computing architecture continues to evolve, we are
building new solutions to support our customers’ transition to new computing paradigms.
Our research and development capabilities are built on product development expertise in
each computing era and environment, with a focus on investing in solutions for important
production environments. Sustained customer-centric innovation has allowed us to win
customers and grow market share. Our most recent innovations include the development
of global SaaS delivery capabilities, support for containers, agile software development
and the addition of cognitive capabilities.

**Our Growth Strategy**

Following the 2013 Acquisition, we experienced a 7% decline in core non-GAAP product revenue
on a constant currency basis from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014. However, since 2014, we have
experienced stable organic growth, with non-GAAP revenue in our core product lines growing at a
CAGR of 4% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018 on a constant currency basis. Our goal is to
maintain and extend our industry-recognized position as a leading global ITOM solutions provider. Key
elements of our growth strategy include:

‰ Further Expand Our Solution Footprint. As our portfolio of solutions continues to expand
and we enter adjacent markets, we aim to expand our customer base, as well as increase the
solutions purchased by existing customers. Based on the spend rate of our single-product
customers, as compared to that of our multi-product customers, and assuming we can convert
our existing single-product customers into multi-product customers, we believe there is
approximately $3 billion in customer growth opportunity within our existing customer base.

‰ Innovate to Expand and Enhance Our Portfolio of Solutions. We have invested
approximately $1.9 billion in research and development initiatives, averaging 24% of
non-GAAP product revenue, since our privatization in 2013. We intend to continue our
longstanding commitment to research and development. We plan to expand our portfolio of
innovative products and add advanced delivery and deployment capabilities to our existing
solutions to meet our customers’ evolving business requirements and technological challenges.

‰ Build on Our Technology Leadership with Strategic Technology Partnerships. We
intend to further expand our partner ecosystem, particularly with leading public and private

cloud infrastructure vendors, to assist existing customers migrating to the cloud and support
new customers with cloud-native business services and applications.

‰ Continue to **_Drive Growth_** **_and Operational_** **_Efficiencies._** The introduction of new
innovative products, coupled with actioned cost savings exceeding $300 million, has enabled
us to invest in high-priority growth initiatives, such as the modernization of our existing product
portfolio and enhancing our go-to-market engine, along with our ongoing investments in
research and development, has positioned us well to retain our existing customers and to sell
new products. We have also demonstrated consistent execution and disciplined cost control,
resulting in non-GAAP revenue and Non-GAAP EBITDA growth in each of the last four fiscal
years. The strength of our product portfolio and the size of our installed base result in attractive
operating leverage, a key driver of robust Non-GAAP EBITDA growth.

**Customers**

As of March 31, 2018, we serve a large, diverse and sophisticated base of more than 10,000
customers across over 120 countries worldwide, ranging from enterprise level organizations to small
and medium businesses, including 97 of the Forbes Global 100. We also count as our clients 49 of the
top 50 commercial banks, all of the top 25 manufacturing companies, 23 of the top 25 insurance
companies and 24 of the top 25 telecom companies, based on Forbes Global rankings.

Our software products are widely deployed by organizations across a broad range of industries,
businesses and applications worldwide, with particular strengths in banking, insurance and
governmental agencies. They include major telecommunication companies, manufacturers,
educational institutions, retailers, hospitals and other industries, as well as channel partners including
resellers, distributors and systems integrators. Our solutions are deeply embedded in customers’ IT
infrastructure and more than 80% of our non-GAAP revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 is
attributable to customers that have maintained a relationship with BMC for 10 years or more. Except
for one customer that represented 5.3% of our non-GAAP revenue in fiscal year 2018, no customer
represented more than 5% of our non-GAAP revenue in any of the past three fiscal years.

**Sales and Marketing**

Our sales and marketing teams work closely together to increase market awareness, drive
demand for our platform, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31,
2018, we had approximately 1,760 employees in sales and marketing.

We market and sell our software and services solutions primarily through a direct sales force,
complemented by strategic alliances with channel partners including resellers, distributors, original
equipment manufacturers, alliance partners and systems integrators. We also have an inside sales
division that provides a channel for additional sales to existing customers.

_Sales_

Our sales force resources are aligned by both customer size and geography. These direct sales
representatives typically have a defined quota based on a specific set of named accounts. Direct sales
resources are then supplemented by software consultants and specialist resources with targeted skills,
such as automation specialists that help move forward cloud and datacenter automation opportunities.
In addition, in some product areas, an inside sales team will actively advance opportunities to close.
Our sales offices are located across North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America.

In addition to our direct sales force, we had more than 500 indirect channel partners as of
March 31, 2018, many of which focus on smaller companies and countries where we do not have a

137


-----

direct presence. These third-party channel relationships allow us to expand our market presence
through increased awareness of software applications within our partners’ organizations and customer
bases, and through personnel who are trained to implement our software. Our partners market and
promote their software products and typically provide implementation services to our end-users. In
most cases, this channel is able to generate sales leads, make initial customer contacts, and assess
needs prior to our introduction.

_Marketing_

Our sales efforts are supported by marketing initiatives. Collectively, these activities are designed
to generate leads, educate our customers, define and launch new solutions, drive solution adoption
and enhance customer loyalty and retention. Marketing programs include use of websites to provide
product and company information, whitepapers and other information, email marketing, telemarketing,
webinars, search engine marketing, issuing press releases on a regular basis, analyst engagement
and exhibiting at industry events. We have developed a number of programs to encourage better
understanding of our software and services solutions and active exchange of ideas between
prospective and existing customers, including hosting customer advisory councils, executive forums
and other events.

Our selling and marketing expense was $558.3 million, $553.1 million and $554.4 million for the
years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

**Competition**

The ITOM software industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing and significantly affected by
new emerging technologies and product offerings. We believe the principal competitive factors
affecting our market include:

‰ expertise in ITOM enterprise software processes;

‰ product features, functionality, performance and price;

‰ cost containment;

‰ ease of integration and speed of implementation;

‰ company stability, resources and reputation;

‰ level of customer service; and

‰ new product and technology introductions.

We believe we have competitive advantages over a number of our competitors. Some of these
advantages include:

‰ highly integrated portfolio focused on functionality in a heterogeneous environment;

‰ a variety of delivery methods;

‰ low total cost of ownership;

‰ ease-of-use and efficiency during deployment;

‰ long-term customer relationships with senior IT decision-makers at large enterprises;

‰ strong track record of innovation;

‰ openness and flexibility of our software architecture; and

‰ high quality of maintenance and customer support.

138


-----

Our most frequently encountered competitors are IBM, CA, HPE/MicroFocus and ServiceNow, all
of which are enterprise software vendors that are focused on ITOM. Smaller competitors utilize ITOM
to complement their infrastructure stack and help drive other segments of their business. We believe
there is demand for a vendor like us that offers a broad yet integrated platform that is scalable to a
variety of organizations, available for swift implementation and operates in a cost-efficient manner. We
strive to provide a portfolio of solutions that delivers complementary products capable of functioning
across mainframe, traditional on-premise, virtualized and emerging cloud infrastructures.

We have also strengthened our competitive position by launching innovative new products such
as Remedy 9, TrueSight Intelligence, Discovery for Multi-Cloud, Innovation Suite and TrueSight Cloud
_Cost Control. We also offer a premier Professional Services program to assist our customers with_
implementation, integration, IT process, re-engineering and education services related to our products
and the IT functions and processes they help to manage. Improving the overall customer experience
through this service helps drive future license transactions with existing customers.

**Research and Development**

Our product development efforts are focused on enhancing the capabilities and increasing the
performance of existing ITOM product suites as well as developing new and innovative solutions to
challenges faced by IT organizations. These efforts are organized into four engineering groups aligned
to our business units, as well as some cross-product line functions such as customer engineering and
quality. Engineering resources are deployed globally, with major development centers such as Austin,
Texas, Lexington, Kentucky and San Jose, California in the U.S., and global locations such as Pune,
India and Tel Hai, Israel.

Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the
software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until
the product is generally available to customers in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development expenses of
$163.6 million, $166.9 million and $160.2 million, respectively. We plan to dedicate significant
resources to our continued research and development efforts. In addition, during fiscal years 2018,
2017 and 2016, we capitalized software development costs excluding share-based compensation of
$9.4 million, $20.5 million and $46.2 million, respectively. The decrease in capitalized software
development costs during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflects the Company’s adoption of more
agile research and development methods for the majority of its product lines, which has the effect of
decreasing the amounts of software development costs capitalized.

As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,530 employees in our research and development
group. We strongly believe in providing an excellent customer experience and have invested greatly in
our user interface to improve ease of use for our customers. Also, we focus our efforts on developing
our core technologies and further enhancing their usability, functionality, reliability, performance and
flexibility. These will remain areas of focus for us as we target new customers and use cases, as
displayed in the releases of our DSM Security Operations, Performance and Analytics and DBA
solutions.

We leverage agile development methodologies and work with the latest technologies, resulting in
a dynamic, state of the art, automated software development processes that has allowed us to deliver
high-quality products and services and adapt to market changes and new requirements quickly. We
supplement internal development through acquisitions and third-party licensing agreements when
appropriate.

139


-----

**Intellectual Property**

We distribute products in object code form and rely upon contract, trade secret, copyright and
patent laws to protect our intellectual property. The license agreements under which customers use our
products restrict the customer’s use of our intellectual property to its own operations and prohibit
disclosure of our confidential information to third parties. In addition, for certain solutions, we employ
protective measures such as CPU-dependent passwords, expiring passwords and time-based software
trials. As of March 31, 2018, we had more than 300 U.S.-issued patents.

**Employees**

As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,800 employees, including approximately 1,760 in
sales and marketing, 2,530 in product development and customer support, 490 in services and 1,020
in administration. Of these employees, approximately 2,150 were in the U.S. and approximately 3,650
were in our international locations. Other than works councils and collective bargaining agreements as
required by local labor law requirements in certain countries outside of the U.S. in which we operate,
none of our employees are represented by a union or other collective bargaining agreements.

**Facilities**

Our corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately
216,000 square feet under a ten-year lease agreement which expires in June 2026. We also maintain
offices in multiple locations in the United States and internationally, including in Santa Clara, California,
Australia, Singapore, Israel and Pune, India. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real
property.

We anticipate leasing additional office space in the future as we continue to grow and enter new
geographies. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future,
and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or substitute space will be available on commercially
reasonable terms.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to various labor claims brought by certain former international employees alleging
that amounts are due to such employees for unpaid commissions and other compensation. The claims
are in various stages and are not expected to be fully resolved in the near future; however, we intend
to vigorously contest all of the claims. Taking into account accruals we have recorded, we believe the
likelihood of a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements resulting from these
claims is remote. However, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of these matters.

We are litigating a matter in Brazilian courts as to whether a tax applies to the remittance of
software payments from our Brazilian operations. In February 2007, a law was enacted that clarified
that this particular tax did not apply to the remittance of software payments, retroactive to January 1,
2006. We continue to pursue a favorable resolution on this matter for years prior to January 1, 2006.
While we believe we will ultimately prevail based on the merits of our position, if we do not, we could
incur a charge of up to approximately $7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates as of
March 31, 2018; however, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this matter.

On April 28, 2017, BMC Software filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cherwell
Software, LLC (“Cherwell”) and FireScope, Inc. (“FireScope”) (collectively, the “Defendants”). The
lawsuit alleges that the Defendants have built much of their business around the infringement of BMC
Software’s patented technologies. In the filing, BMC Software claims its patents are being infringed by

140


-----

products that comprise core elements of the Defendants’ IT management offerings and alleges
violations of seven different BMC Software patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in
total. BMC Software is seeking damages and a permanent injunction against each of Cherwell and
FireScope. The cases are styled BMC Software, Inc. v. Cherwell Software, LLC,
No. 17-cv-03127-MSK-STV (D. Colo.) and BMC Software, Inc. v. FireScope, Inc.,
No. 3:17-cv-1369 (N.D. Tex.).

On July 21, 2017, BMC filed a Complaint and Application for Preliminary and Permanent
Injunction against International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The lawsuit alleges that IBM is disrupting
BMC’s relationship with a large customer in violation of its Outsourcing Attachment (“OA”) with BMC
and that IBM is misappropriating BMC’s trade secrets in violation of the OA, the relevant Master
License Agreement, and several statutes aimed at trade secret protection. The lawsuit also alleges that
IBM fraudulently induced BMC to enter into the OA by non-disclosure and misrepresentation of its
plans regarding the relevant customer. The case is styled BMC Software, Inc. vs. International
Business Machines Corporation, Case No. 4:17-cv-2254, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.

Additionally, from time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of
litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the resolution of these
ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, such litigation or claims can have a
negative impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources
from our business and other factors.

**PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS**

Following the consummation of the Merger, all of our issued and outstanding common equity
interests will be held indirectly by Parent. At such time, the Sponsor will own a majority of the issued
and outstanding common equity interests of Parent. The remainder of the minority of the outstanding
common equity interests of Parent will be held by the stockholders of Boxer Parent Company to which
the rollover offer was made by Parent and which elected to roll over all or a portion of their shares in
Boxer Parent Company in exchange for shares of Parent common stock, subject to the terms and
conditions of the rollover offer and rollover agreements entered into in connection therewith (the
“Rollover Offer Participants”). All members of our Board of Directors affiliated with the Sponsor may be
deemed to beneficially own shares owned by the Sponsor. Each such individual disclaims beneficial
ownership of any such shares in which such individual does not have a pecuniary interest. After the
closing of the Merger, we anticipate that members of senior management as well as other select
employees of entities managed by Parent, its subsidiaries and joint ventures will be given the
opportunity from time to time to make cash investments and/or to receive grants of stock options of
Parent.

145

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Arrangements with the Sponsor and its Respective Affiliates**

Boxer Parent Company and certain subsidiaries or parent companies, including Parent, expect to
enter into various related party agreements with the Sponsor in the ordinary course of business and in
contemplation of the Transactions.

**_KKR Transaction Fee Agreement, KKR Monitoring Agreement, KCM Syndication Fee_**
**_Agreement and Indemnification Agreement_**

Upon consummation of the Merger, Boxer Parent Company expects to enter into a transaction
fee agreement with KKR, pursuant to which Boxer Parent Company, after the closing of the Merger,
would pay KKR a fee and reimburse KKR for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
consulting services with respect to Boxer Parent Company, including Parent’s investment therein. The
amount of such fee would be approximately 3% of the amount of the Sponsor Equity Contribution
funded to Parent at the closing of the Merger.

In addition, at the closing of the Merger, BMC Software, Inc. expects to enter into a monitoring
agreement with KKR pursuant to which KKR would provide management services to BMC Software,
Inc. and its subsidiaries, parent entities and controlled affiliates and in consideration of such services
BMC Software, Inc. would pay KKR an annual management fee payable quarterly in arrears equal to
1% of Non-GAAP EBITDA as disclosed by the Company in its annual “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In addition, BMC Software, Inc. would
reimburse KKR for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the provision of such
services. It is also expected that, if the Sponsor continues to be a significant stock or equityholder, the
monitoring agreement will provide for a termination payment based on the net present value of certain
future payment obligations under the monitoring agreement, if the agreement is terminated in
connection with a change in control of Parent or an initial public offering by Parent.

In addition, prior to or following the closing of the Merger, the Sponsor will have the right to allow
one or more co-investors to invest or acquired interests in entities that indirectly own shares of Parent’s
common stock (the “KKR Equity Syndication”). In connection with the KKR Equity Syndication, Parent
may enter into a syndication fee agreement with KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of the initial
purchasers in this offering (“KCM”), pursuant to which KCM would provide services to BMC and its
affiliates in connection with such KKR Equity Syndication and in consideration of such services BMC
would pay KCM a customary fee for such services and reimburse KCM for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection therewith.

In addition, at the closing of the Merger, Parent and Boxer Parent Company expect to enter into
an indemnification agreement with KKR which will provide customary exculpation and indemnification
to KKR and its affiliates and their designees on the board of directors of Parent or boards of directors
of subsidiaries of Parent on which they may serve in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any additional equity and debt
financings and capital-raising or other transactions after the closing of the Merger or any other services
provided by KKR or its affiliates to Parent and its subsidiaries pursuant to the agreements described
above or the service of such designees on Parent’s board of directors or such other boards.

**_Registration Rights Agreement_**

Parent and the Sponsor will enter into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights
Agreement”) with respect to the Sponsor’s investments in Parent. The Registration Rights Agreement
will contain customary registration rights provisions, pursuant to which certain holders of shares of
common stock of Parent will be entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of such shares
under the Securities Act.

146


-----

The Registration Rights Agreement is expected to grant the Sponsor the right to cause Parent to
register shares of Parent’s common stock held by the Sponsor under the Securities Act and, if
requested, to use its reasonable best efforts (if we are not eligible to use an automatic shelf registration
statement at the time of filing) to maintain a shelf registration statement effective with respect to such
shares. Certain other stockholders of Parent will be entitled to participate on a pro rata basis in any
registration of Parent’s common stock under the Securities Act that we may undertake. The
Registration Rights Agreement is expected to provide that we will pay certain expenses relating to such
registrations and indemnify the Sponsor and certain other stockholders of Parent participating in any
offering against certain liabilities, which may arise under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
state securities law or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to us.

**PIK Preferred Equity**

Concurrently with the consummation of the Merger, Parent will issue shares of Series A preferred
stock with an initial aggregate liquidation preference of $300.0 million, which we refer to as the PIK
Preferred Equity. The shares of PIK Preferred Equity will have a payment priority, liquidation
preference and rank senior to Parent’s common stock. The shares of PIK Preferred Equity will be
equity instruments with no voting or consent rights, other than the right to approve, by at least a
majority vote, the issuance of any equity securities of Parent ranking (with respect to distribution rights
and rights upon Parent’s liquidation, winding up or dissolution) senior to the PIK Preferred Equity. The
shares will accumulate dividends on a daily basis in arrears during each dividend period on the thencurrent stated value of each share of PIK Preferred Equity. Dividends will be payable semi-annually by
increasing the principal amount of outstanding shares of the PIK Preferred Equity or by issuing shares
of PIK Preferred Equity in a principal amount equal to such dividends. Parent will make customary
representations and warranties in connection with the issuance of the PIK Preferred Equity, and Parent
and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Issuer and its subsidiaries, will be subject to negative
covenants under agreements associated with the PIK Preferred Equity, including, among other things,
covenants restricting incurrence of future debt, issuance of future preferred stock and making of
restricted payments. The shares of PIK Preferred Equity will be perpetual. Upon the occurrence of (i) a
change of control of Parent or (ii) an initial public offering, all of the then outstanding shares of PIK
Preferred Equity will be redeemed for cash.

The definitive documentation with respect to the PIK Preferred Equity has not been finalized and
remains subject to negotiation.

**Other Relationships**

In addition, KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of KKR, and
therefore an affiliate of Parent and the Issuer. KKR Capital Markets LLC will also act as a joint lead
arranger for the Credit Facilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Facilities**

In connection with the Merger, we expect to enter into the Credit Facilities, pursuant to the credit
agreement, to be dated as of the date of the closing of the Merger (the “Closing Date”) and as
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time. The following is a summary
of what are expected to be the principal terms of the Credit Facilities, although these terms are still
being negotiated and are subject to change. The final terms of the Credit Facilities may differ from the
terms described below.

The Credit Facilities are expected to consist of (a) a $3,300.0 million USD Term Loan Facility to
be funded in a single drawing on the Closing Date, (b) a €930.0 million Euro Term Loan Facility to be
funded in a single drawing on the Closing Date and (c) a $400.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which
will include a sub-limit for letters of credit. Repayments and prepayments of loans under the Term Loan
Facilities (“Term Loans”) may not be reborrowed. Amounts borrowed under the aforementioned
Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed prior to the maturity date thereof.

Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, we will have the option under our Credit Facilities to
add one or more incremental term loan or revolving credit facilities and/or increase commitments under
our Revolving Credit Facility, in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the sum of (a) the greater of (i)
$700.0 million and (ii) 85% of Consolidated EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to the credit agreement)
and (b) the aggregate amount of voluntary prepayments of Term Loans and voluntary commitment
reductions of the Revolving Credit Facility (in each case, to the extent not funded with the proceeds of
long-term debt), plus (ii) an additional unlimited amount subject to compliance with certain leveragebased criteria set forth in the credit agreement. The indenture governing the Notes will allow for even
greater “incremental” secured debt capacity than permitted under our Credit Facilities. See “Description
of Notes.”

**_Amortization and Maturity_**

The Term Loan Facilities are expected to mature on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date
and the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to mature on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date.
Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facilities are expected to amortize in equal quarterly
installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans under the USD Term Loan
Facility and Euro Term Loan Facility, respectively, commencing the first full fiscal quarter ending after
the Closing Date. The balance of the Term Loans shall be payable on the maturity date for the Term
Loan Facilities. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and
payable in full on the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

The loans under the Credit Facilities are expected to bear interest on the outstanding unpaid
principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate equal
to the highest of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and
(iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0% or (b) a LIBOR rate that is subject to a 0.0% interest rate floor. The
USD Term Loan Facility will have an applicable margin of 425 basis points and the Euro Term Loan
Facility will have an applicable margin of 475 basis points. Borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros and British
pound sterling under the Revolving Credit Facility will have an applicable margin of 300 basis points,
350 basis points and 300 basis points, respectively, which applicable margin will be reduced upon
achievement of certain leverage-based criteria set forth in the Credit Agreement.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Facilities, we will be
required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% in respect of the unutilized commitments under the

148


-----

Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Commitment Fee”). The Revolving Commitment Fee will be
reduced upon achievement of certain leverage-based criteria set forth in the credit agreement. Upon
the issuance of letters of credit under the Credit Facilities, the borrower will be required to pay a
fronting fee, certain issuance and administration fees and a per annum letter of credit fee as set forth in
the credit agreement.

**_Mandatory and Voluntary Prepayments_**

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Term Loans will be required to be prepaid with:
(a) 50% of excess cash flow, in excess of certain annual thresholds and with step-downs to 25% and
0% upon achievement of certain leverage-based criteria set forth in the credit agreement; (b) 100% of
the net cash proceeds of any non-ordinary course disposition of property in excess of certain individual
and aggregate amounts, unless such net cash proceeds are reinvested within 450 days or committed
to be reinvested within 450 days and reinvested no later than six months thereafter; and (c) 100% of
net cash proceeds from any issuance of indebtedness (other than indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Credit Facilities (excluding permitted refinancing indebtedness)).

Term Loans may be voluntarily prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, other than certain
breakage costs; provided, however, that voluntary prepayments, refinancings or repricings of the Term
Loans in connection with certain repricing transactions that occur prior to the twelve-month anniversary
of the Closing Date shall be subject to a prepayment payment of 1.00% of the principal amount of the
Term Loan so prepaid, refinanced or repriced. We may voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under,
and may voluntarily reduce commitments made under, the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without
premium or penalty, other than certain breakage costs.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The obligations of the borrower under the Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by the direct parent
thereof and by each of the borrower’s direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries,
subject to certain exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not
permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences. Such
obligations and the related guarantees will be secured by a perfected first priority security interest in
substantially all tangible and intangible assets owned by us or by any guarantor, in each case subject
to permitted liens and certain exceptions.

**_Covenants_**

The Credit Facilities are expected to contain a number of affirmative covenants and negative
covenants, subject to certain exceptions. The Revolving Credit Facility (but not the Term Loan
Facilities) will contain a springing financial covenant requiring total net first lien secured leverage not to
exceed a level to be agreed over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility, which will be tested only if the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of
credit (other than cash collateral letters of credit) in excess of $40.0 million exceed 35% of the total
commitment amount of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Events of Default_**

The Credit Facilities will contain certain events of default, including a change of control.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In
this description, (i) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to (a) prior to the consummation of the
Merger, Banff Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub,” which shall be merged with and into Boxer Parent
Company Inc., with Boxer Parent Company Inc. surviving such merger) and not any of its Affiliates and
(b) from and after the consummation of the Merger, Boxer Parent Company Inc. and its consolidated
Subsidiaries taken together; and (ii) the term “Issuer” refers only to (a) prior to the consummation of the
Merger, Banff Merger Sub Inc. and not any of its Affiliates and (b) from and after the consummation of
the Merger, Boxer Parent Company Inc. and not any of its Subsidiaries. Upon consummation of the
Merger on the Completion Date, Boxer Parent Company Inc. will assume all of Merger Sub’s
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

The Issuer will issue $1,475.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.750% Senior Notes due
2026 (the “Dollar Notes”) and €301.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes due
2026 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes” and each, a “series of Notes”)
under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Initial Indenture”) between the Issuer and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Dollar Notes and
the Euro Notes will each be issued as a separate series, but, except as otherwise provided below, will
be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture (as defined below). On the Completion
Date, upon the consummation of the Transactions, Boxer Parent Company Inc. and the Guarantors will
enter into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Initial
Indenture, the “Indenture”) with the Trustee. The Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Application will be made to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the “Exchange”) and for the Euro Notes to be admitted to trading thereto. The listing
application will be subject to approval by The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Authority”). There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted.

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger.
Substantially concurrently with the closing of this offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will
enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the Issue Date among the
Issuer, the Trustee and The Bank of New York Mellon, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant
to which (x) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Notes will be deposited into a segregated
escrow account (the “Dollar Escrow Account”) and (y) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Euro
Notes will be deposited into a segregated escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account” and, together
with the Dollar Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts” and each an “Escrow Account”). If the Merger
is not consummated on or prior to February 26, 2019 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), each series of
Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest on such series of Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and
the Guarantees, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, including the definitions of certain terms
used therein. We urge you to read each of these documents because they, and not this description, will
define your rights as Holders. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Notes at our address
set forth under the heading “Summary.”

150


-----

**Brief Description of Notes**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Notes will initially be senior obligations solely of
Merger Sub secured by the Escrowed Property (as defined below) and will not have the benefit of any
Guarantees or any other credit support from Boxer Parent Company Inc. or any of its Subsidiaries. See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

From and after the consummation of the Merger, the Notes will be:

‰ general senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer;

‰ senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

‰ pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the
Senior Credit Facilities) of the Issuer;

‰ effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including the Senior
Credit Facilities) of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
Indebtedness;

‰ structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities,
including Preferred Stock, of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors; and

‰ guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary of the Issuer that incurs or guarantees any Obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities or certain future Indebtedness.

**Guarantees**

Following the consummation of the Merger, the Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely
as sureties, will jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis,
the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, whether for payment of
principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on
the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture.

As further described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by
Restricted Subsidiaries,” each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer
that incurs or guarantees any Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or certain future
Indebtedness (and any Domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary if
such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary incurs or guarantees Indebtedness under the Senior Credit
Facilities or certain capital markets debt securities) will, subject to certain exceptions and to release as
provided below or elsewhere in this “Description of Notes,” guarantee the Notes.

The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be:

‰ a general senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor;

‰ senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such
Guarantor;

‰ pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor (including its guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities);

‰ effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including its
guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities) of such Guarantor to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; and

151


-----

‰ structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities,
including Preferred Stock of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth under “—Limitation on Guarantees of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” (or the 30-day grace period set forth therein), the Issuer shall
cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is (or becomes) a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Credit
Facilities on the Completion Date to execute and deliver on the Completion Date a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary. Each of the
Issuer’s Subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities as of the
Completion Date will guarantee the Notes.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of
all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an
amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net
assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are
limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a
fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from
constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated
by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the
applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on
its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
Indebtedness—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and
guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture
and such Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor
(including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor to a Person that
is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) (i) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor
with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities or (ii) the release or discharge of such other guarantee
or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee (except, in each case of
clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or
direct obligation, it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a
release) unless, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), at the time of such release or discharge, such
Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would
require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations
under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(e) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or
another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or

152


-----

upon the liquidation of a Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Issuer or
another Guarantor; or

(f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that (i) such Guarantee shall
not be released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with respect
to any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) such Guarantee shall be reinstated
upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.

**Ranking**

From and after the Completion Date, the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes and the payment of any Guarantee will be unsecured and the Indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes and the Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor,
as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, including the Obligations of the
Issuer and such Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities. From and after the Completion Date, the
Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future Secured Indebtedness, including the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness. The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a
particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Holders will have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in
the Escrow Account to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined
below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.

From and after the Completion Date, all of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through
the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer, including
trade creditors and creditors holding Indebtedness or guarantees issued by such non-guarantor
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries generally will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries over the
claims of our creditors, including Holders, even if such claims do not constitute Senior Indebtedness.
Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred stockholders, if any, of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries.

As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of
proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the Issuer and the Guarantors collectively
would have had $4,394.1 million of Secured Indebtedness outstanding and $400.0 million of availability
under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding $31.7 million of outstanding letters of credit), all of which
would have ranked effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby.

As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, excluding the
effect of intercompany transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for
approximately $483.8 million, or 49.0%, of our total revenue, and approximately $451.2 million, or
55.4%, of our Non-GAAP EBITDA. As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, the
non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $3,778.1 million, or 35.8%, of our
consolidated total assets, and approximately $1,125.1 million, or 13.6%, of our consolidated total
liabilities.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Secured Indebtedness
that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances, the amount of
such Secured Indebtedness could be substantial. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence

153


-----

of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” In addition, although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by,
and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of, the Restricted Subsidiaries, such
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and the Indebtedness
incurred and Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock issued in compliance with the covenants could be
substantial. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the
incurrence or issuance by such Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

**Paying Agents and Registrars for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Dollar Notes
and the Euro Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the Dollar Notes will be the Trustee. The initial Paying
Agent for the Euro Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Paying Agents will
make payments on the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) for the Dollar Notes and
the Euro Notes. The initial Registrar for each series of Notes will be the Trustee. The Registrar will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make
payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents or the Registrars without prior notice to the Holders.
The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent or Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions
set forth in the section of this Offering Circular entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The Registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes and fees required by law
and due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or other tender offer. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 10 days before delivering a notice of redemption of Notes to be
redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will initially issue $1,475.0 million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes in this
offering and €301.5 million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes in this offering. The Dollar Notes
and the Euro Notes will constitute separate series of Notes under the Indenture but, except as
otherwise provided below, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The
Notes will mature on September 1, 2026.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,” the Issuer may issue additional Dollar Notes (“Additional Dollar Notes”) and
additional Euro Notes (“Additional Euro Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Notes,
“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Indenture. The Dollar Notes offered
hereby and any Additional Dollar Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and

154


-----

offers to purchase; provided, however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional
Dollar Notes, unless the Dollar Notes and the Additional Dollar Notes are treated as fungible for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. The Euro Notes offered hereby and any Additional Euro Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class (except as otherwise
provided) for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers
to purchase; provided, however, that a separate CUSIP or Common Code will be issued for the
Additional Euro Notes, unless the Euro Notes and the Additional Euro Notes are treated as fungible for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all
purposes of the Indenture, the Guarantees and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes
that are actually issued.

Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of 9.750% per annum. Interest on the Euro
Notes will accrue at the rate of 8.375% per annum. Interest on each series of Notes will be payable in
cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1,
2019, to the Holders of record as of the close of business (if applicable) on the immediately preceding
February 15 and August 15 (whether or not a Business Day). Interest on each series of Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest
has been paid or duly provided for, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on each series of Notes
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The Dollar Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof. The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on each series of Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the applicable Paying Agent maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying
Agents and Registrars for the Notes” or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made
by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by
wire transfer; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to
(x) the Dollar Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC
or its nominee will be made in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures, and (y) the Euro Notes
represented by one or more global notes registered in the name or held by the common depository of
Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee will be made in accordance with Euroclear’s and/or
Clearstream’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s office or
agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment date, the
maturity date or any earlier required repurchase or redemption date falls on a day that is a Legal
Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest on
such payment will accrue in respect of the delay.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,”
the Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Issuer,
the Investors and their respective Affiliates may, at their discretion, at any time and from time to time,
acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger.
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will

155


-----

enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Escrow Agent into (x) the Dollar Escrow Account, an
amount equal to the gross proceeds of this offering of the Dollar Notes sold on the Issue Date and
(y) the Euro Escrow Account, an amount equal to the gross proceeds of this offering of the Euro Notes
sold on the Issue Date.

The initial funds deposited in the Dollar Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest,
dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Dollar Escrow Account in
connection with the Dollar Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Dollar Escrowed Property.” The initial funds deposited
in the Euro Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other
property and payments credited to the Euro Escrow Account in connection with the Euro Notes (less
any property and/or funds paid (including negative rate charges) in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Euro Escrowed Property”, and together with the Dollar
Escrowed Property, the “Escrowed Property.” The Dollar Escrowed Property will be controlled by the
Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Dollar Notes, and Euro Escrowed
Property will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Euro
Notes. Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the applicable
series of Notes.

In order for the Issuer to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer
(the “Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, on or before
the Escrow Outside Date, an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon
which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further
investigation, to the effect that:

(1) the Merger will be consummated substantially concurrently with or promptly following the
release of the Escrowed Property; and

(2) the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities has become effective or will
become effective substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Account.

The Release will occur promptly following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Escrow Release
Officer’s Certificate (the date of the Release, the “Completion Date”). Upon the Release, the Escrowed
Property will be paid out of each Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and each
Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

The Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders, subject to certain
liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account to secure the payment
of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of each series of Notes; provided,
_however, that such liens and security interests shall automatically be released and terminate at such_
time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the Completion Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, such liens and security interests will, be permitted under the Indenture. The
Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Issuer in such customary short-term
liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and
liquidate such investments, as the Issuer will from time to time direct in writing.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Outside Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have
received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date, (b) the Issuer informs the
Escrow Agent in writing that, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Merger will not be
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date or (c) the Issuer informs the Escrow Agent in

156


-----

writing that the Merger Agreement was terminated prior to the Escrow Outside Date (the date of any
such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem each series of Notes (the
“Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to
(x) with respect to the Dollar Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the Dollar Notes, plus accrued but
unpaid interest on the Dollar Notes, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date (as defined below) and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the
Euro Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the Euro Notes, if any, from the Issue Date to the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, in each case, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, each Paying Agent and the
Escrow Agent, and will provide that each series of Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later
than the third Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”) or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. On the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder of the
applicable series of Notes the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes
and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to
the Issuer.

The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to
Holders of the applicable series of Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special
Mandatory Redemption for any series of Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed
Property, the Investors will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special
Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property pursuant to a
commitment provided by them.

**Activities Prior to Escrow Release**

Prior to the Completion Date, Merger Sub’s activities are restricted to issuing the Notes, issuing
capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions, performing its obligations under the Merger
Agreement and/or in connection with the Transactions, performing its obligations in respect of the
Notes under the Indenture and/or the Escrow Agreement, engaging in activities in connection with
entering into the Senior Credit Facilities, consummating the Release or redeeming the Notes as set
forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and
conducting such other activities as are related to the foregoing or are necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the Transactions or the transactions relating thereto. Prior to the Completion Date, the
Indenture will provide that Merger Sub will not engage in any business activity or enter into any
transaction or agreement (including, without limitation, making any restricted payment, incurring any
debt, incurring any Liens except in favor of the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee, entering into any
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or engaging in any
transaction with its Affiliates) except in the ordinary course of engaging in the actions and activities
described in the immediately preceding sentence, as permitted in connection with the release of the
Escrowed Property pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or as necessary to effectuate the Transactions
or the transactions relating thereto.

Prior to the Completion Date, Boxer Parent Company Inc. and its Subsidiaries will not be parties
to the Indenture and will not be controlled by Merger Sub; accordingly, prior to the Completion Date,
Boxer Parent Company Inc. and its Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictions, agreements or
covenants in the Indenture.

**Redemption of Euro Notes for Tax Reasons**

After the Completion Date, the Issuer may redeem the Euro Notes in whole, but not in part, at any
time upon giving not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders of
such Euro Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as
defined below under “—Payment of Additional Amounts on the Euro Notes”), if any, then due and
which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order
by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or revenue guidance) (each
of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of such Euro Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Euro Notes, and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent and, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or a Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts, in either case, where this would be
reasonable, but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to such Euro
Notes). Such Change in Tax Law must (i) not have been publicly announced before the Issue Date and
(ii) become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one
payment on such Euro Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the
time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption
will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to
make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of any Euro Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an
Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant
Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Holders of the Euro Notes.

**Payment of Additional Amounts on the Euro Notes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any
successor entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Euro Notes or with respect to any Guarantee

158


-----

thereof, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any Euro Note or Guarantee thereof
is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power
to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or
the Paying Agent with respect to any Euro Note or Guarantee thereof, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would
have been received in respect of such payments on any such Euro Note or Guarantee thereof in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Euro Note (or between
a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or
being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Euro Note or the
receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Euro Note, the
Indenture or a Guarantee of such Euro Note;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Euro Note to provide an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8
(with any required attachments) or W-9 or to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 60 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be made), to provide other certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such
Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of
the Euro Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder or
beneficial owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on
the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment
on or with respect to the Euro Notes or any Guarantee thereof;

159


-----

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Euro Note presented for payment by or on
behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting
the Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another available Paying Agent in a member
state of the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous
to comply with), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code (or
any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), or any law, legislation, rules
or practices implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(8) any Taxes imposed as a result of the beneficial owner being or having been (i) a
“10-percent shareholder” of the Issuer as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any
successor provision or (ii) a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer within the
meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code or any successor provision;

(9) any Taxes imposed as a result of the Holder or beneficial owner being a bank receiving
payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of its trade or business, as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any
successor provision;

(10) any Taxes imposed by reason of the Holder’s or beneficial owner’s past or present
status as a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign
tax-exempt organization or a personal holding company with respect to the United States or as a
corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; or

(11) any combination of the items (1) through (10) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or limited liability company or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Euro
Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or limited liability company or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Euro Notes
directly.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of
tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the
Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies
or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made
available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Euro Note or Guarantee of a Euro Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

160


-----

Wherever in the Indenture, the Euro Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in
any context, with respect to the Euro Notes:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Euro Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any Guarantee of a Euro Note,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holders and beneficial owners of the Euro Notes for any
present or future stamp, transfer, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise,
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with
respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement
or registration of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Euro Note, any Guarantee of a Euro Note,
the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Euro Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such
taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on
the Euro Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) and (5) through (10)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture
and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Euro Notes or Guarantees thereof is made by
or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Issuance in Euro; Payment on the Notes**

Initial Holders of Euro Notes will be required to pay for the Euro Notes in euro, and all payments
of principal of, the redemption price (if any), and interest and Additional Amounts (if any), will be
payable in euro; provided that if, on or after the date of this Offering Circular, the euro is unavailable to
the Issuer due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond its control or if the
euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have
adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within
the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Euro Notes will be made in
U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Issuer or so used. The amount payable on any date
in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as
of the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most
recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second
Business Day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of the Euro Notes so made in
U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Euro Notes or the Indenture. In no event
shall the Trustee or Paying Agent be responsible for monitoring any exchange rates or effecting any
conversions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, if
Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all Notes of such series validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes of such series
that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder
in such tender offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer

specified in any such notice to each Holder at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, except that
redemption notices may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the

Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part only, any notice of redemption or
purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been
or is to be redeemed or purchased.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, if any Notes are to be purchased or
redeemed in part only, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed

occurrence thereof and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related
Equity Offering or other transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or
purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe
each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Redemption Date
may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption
was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the applicable Redemption Date,
or by the applicable Redemption Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in
the Issuer’s discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be
satisfied. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the applicable redemption
price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed
by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or charged with
knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Notes eligible under the Indenture to be
redeemed.

Notes of any series called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for
redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a
future event. On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the
redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes of such series or portions of them called for
redemption, unless such redemption remains conditioned on the happening of a future event.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Completion Date, unless,
prior to, or concurrently with, the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as
defined below), the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through
electronic transmission, a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described

purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a
price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below). Within 30
days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer
electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee sent in the same manner, to each Holder
to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information:

“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly
tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest

Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to the applicable Paying Agent
specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the
third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require
the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent specified in the
notice receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the
expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, an electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC or of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the principal amount of the
Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes
and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be
issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be
equal to at least $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Dollar
Notes or at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the
Euro Notes;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and
describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days
after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that the Issuer shall determine that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control
Payment Date as so delayed; and

(9) such other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a
Holder must follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of
Notes through the facilities of DTC or of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, subject to the
applicable rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

165


-----

(2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of
Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof
have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may, provide that certain
change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a
Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a
default under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements, we could seek a waiver of
such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements. In the
event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or
such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes and our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, and, thus, the removal of
incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between
the initial purchasers and us. We currently have no intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control following the Completion Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so
in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our
ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture
can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of
Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in
the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control
at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any
series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or
any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases
all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such
third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that

166


-----

such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer described above) to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes of such series that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the
date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of
_Control,” may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in_
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at
the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such
Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all
other Asset Sales since the Completion Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents;
_provided that the amount of:_

(i) any liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s, most
recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred, accrued or
increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have
been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to
the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or the
Guarantees of the Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are
otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale)
pursuant to a written agreement which releases the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
from such liabilities;

(ii) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be
satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents
received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(iii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all

167


-----

other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (iii) that is at that
time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $700.0 million and (y) 7.0% of
Consolidated Total Assets of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period at the time
of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall, for purposes of the paragraphs under this caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Asset Sales” (and no other provision of the Indenture), be deemed to be cash or Cash
Equivalents.

Within 450 days after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of any Net Proceeds from
any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(i) to repay:

(w) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (and in
the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto);

(x) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (and in the
case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto);

(y) Obligations under the Notes or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of other Senior
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect
thereto, if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay
any Senior Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer will either (1) reduce Obligations
under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (A) redeeming Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption,” or (B) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or
in arm’s-length privately negotiated transactions, or (2) make an offer (in accordance with
the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their
Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon; or

(z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such
Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of
such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary,
(b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other property or assets (other than Capital Stock),
in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), either (A) that is used or useful in a Similar
Business or (B) that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such
Asset Sale; or

(iii) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (ii) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated_
as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so
long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the
good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of

168


-----

intent within 180 days of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”)
and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within the later of 450 days from the
consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days from the date of the Acceptable Commitment, and, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net
Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess
Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment
within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds
are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment;
_provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before_
such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent
the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired.

To the extent Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be
deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
$50.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of
other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”),
to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes, or that is equal to €1,000 or an integral multiple of
€1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Notes, that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu
Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within
twenty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million by transmitting
electronically or mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the
Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an
Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds
Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the
“Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and,
if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner
not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of
Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount
of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall
select the Notes (subject to applicable procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness
shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the
accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered with
adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be
repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining
Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net
Proceeds the Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent
calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer,

169


-----

any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant,
the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce
Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities)
or otherwise apply such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture,
the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions described in the Indenture by virtue of
such compliance.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding.

The Senior Credit Facilities will limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuer is
contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may
be, may seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does
not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from
purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute a
Default under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture. If on any
date following the Completion Date (i) the Notes of a series have an Investment Grade Rating from any
two of the three Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture
(the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred
to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), then beginning on such date and continuing until the Reversion
Date (as defined below), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following
covenants with respect to such series of Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

170


-----

(6) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.”

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the
“Suspension Date”), the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be reset at zero. In the
event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for
any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) any
two of the three Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating
assigned to the Notes of the applicable series below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to
future events.

The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but
excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The
Guarantees of the Guarantors will be released during the Suspension Period to the extent provided in
clause (f) under “—Guarantees” and subject to the proviso thereto. If the Reversion Date occurs
following a Suspension Date, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries prior to the Reversion Date will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under
the Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made
will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to
a Limited Condition Acquisition entered into during the Suspension Period), (2) all Indebtedness
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed
incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the
second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock,” (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any
Suspension Period, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant
to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant
to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,”
(5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to
take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes
effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the
covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries,” (6) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” on or after the
Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee or direct obligation entered into by such Subsidiary
during the Suspension Period, and (7) all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension
Period in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion
Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Liens.”

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur
Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted
Liens). To the extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended
Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended
Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the
“—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated on and after the Reversion
Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the

171


-----

Indenture, the Notes of the applicable series or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended
Covenants in respect of any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period or any
actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period,
and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events
occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period
or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension
Period), and (2) on and after the Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be
permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform
any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes of any series will ever achieve or maintain Investment
Grade Ratings. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, determine whether
a Suspension Date or Reversion Date has occurred or notify Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the
Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of
Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any
dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation
other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests
(other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to
purchase such Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock); or

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the
case of any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series
of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the
Issuer, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such
dividend, payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or
series of securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests
of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation, in each case held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease, discharge or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each case prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund
payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clauses (7), (8) or (9) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the redemption, defeasance, purchase, repurchase, discharge or other acquisition
of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the
date of redemption, defeasance, purchase, repurchase, discharge or acquisition; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

172


-----

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any
exceptions thereto) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such
Restricted Payment:

(1) other than in the case of a Restricted Investment, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and, in the case of a
Restricted Investment utilizing clause (3)(f) of this paragraph, no (x) Default that, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute an Event of Default described under clause
(1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” or (y) Event of Default
described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies”
shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) other than in the case of (x) a Restricted Investment and (y) amounts attributable to
subclauses (b), (c) and (f) of clause (3) below, immediately after giving effect to such transaction
on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions
of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Completion Date (including
Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (6)(c) and (8) of the next succeeding paragraph,
but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less
than the sum of (without duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one
accounting period) beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter during which the Completion
Date occurs to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal
financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such
Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable
securities or other property received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries since
immediately after the Completion Date (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net
cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) from
the issue or sale of:

(i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined
below), but excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities
or other property received from the sale of:

(x) Equity Interests to any future, current or former employees, directors,
managers or consultants of the Issuer, its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity after
the Completion Date to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted
Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph;
and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) Equity Interests of Parent Entities, to the extent such net cash proceeds are
actually contributed to the Issuer (excluding contributions of the proceeds from the
sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or contributions to the extent

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed
Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Restricted Payments described in the preceding clauses (1) through (20) above and/or
one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be

As of the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The
Issuer will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant

any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be
deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as set forth in
the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether
pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will
not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not guarantee the
Notes.

payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and
the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or
any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (29) of
the preceding paragraph or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will divide, classify or reclassify all or a portion of
such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount
and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) in
one of the above clauses or paragraphs; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under
the Senior Credit Facilities (without giving effect to clause (ii) of the definition thereof) on the
Completion Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) will be treated as incurred on the
Completion Date under clause (1)(a) of the preceding paragraph;

(2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of
Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and
second paragraphs above; and

(3) the principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under any clause of this
covenant shall be determined after giving effect to the application of proceeds of any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance any such Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness originally incurred

186


-----

in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio under
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph is being refinanced under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph
and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to be exceeded
at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional
Indebtedness will be deemed to have been incurred under such clause (1) so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness being
refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Indebtedness incurred to refinance
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (12)(b) above shall be permitted to include
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid
interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts,
fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in
connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of
revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued but
unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting
discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in
a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as
subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness solely because such Indebtedness has a
junior priority with respect to shared collateral or because it is guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures
Obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee of Indebtedness on any asset or
property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, unless (i) the Notes (or the related Guarantee in the case of
Liens on assets of a Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with, or on a senior basis to, (or on a
senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations
secured by such Subject Lien until such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by a Lien or
(ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide
by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon
the release and discharge of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Issuer will not merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not
the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such merger,
consolidation or amalgamation (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person organized or
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (such Person, as the case may be, being
herein called the “Successor Company”); provided that in the case where the Successor
Company is not a corporation, a corporation becomes a co-obligor of the Notes;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, expressly assumes all the Obligations
of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, in each case, pursuant to a supplemental
indenture;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable
Measurement Period,

(a) the Successor Company or the Issuer would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock,” or

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer (or the Successor
Company, as applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the
Applicable Measurement Period immediately prior to such transaction or (y) the
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Issuer (or the Successor Company, as applicable) and
its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or less than the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the Applicable Measurement Period
immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and such
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments, if any, comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for the Issuer under the Indenture
and the Notes and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4),

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and

(2) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of the Issuer,
solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

188


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing two paragraphs, the consummation of the Merger will be permitted
under the Indenture with the only requirement under this covenant with respect to the consummation of
the Merger being that, after consummation of the Merger, Boxer Parent Company Inc. expressly
assumes all the obligations of Merger Sub under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon
the sale, disposition or transfer of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Issuer
will not permit a Guarantor to, merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether
or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any
Person unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any
such merger, consolidation or amalgamation (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person
organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the
case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (such
Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s related Guarantee
pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments; and

(c) except in the case of a merger, consolidation or amalgamation entered into solely
for the purpose of reincorporating a Guarantor in another jurisdiction, immediately after such
transaction, no Event of Default exists; or

(2) the transaction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to,
and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee and such
Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and
such Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor may (i) merge, consolidate
or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another
Guarantor or the Issuer, (ii) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of the Issuer
solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Guarantor in the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) convert into a Person organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or a jurisdiction in the United States, or (iv) liquidate or
dissolve or change its legal form if the Board of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer
determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer and is not materially
disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case, without regard to the requirements set forth in the
preceding paragraph.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to,
or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any
property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of
the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
the greater of (x) $87.5 million and (y) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement
Period, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been

189


-----

obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no
comparable transaction is available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such
Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial
point of view and when such transaction is taken in its entirety; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the
greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 17.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the
Applicable Measurement Period, a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board of the Issuer
approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of such transaction and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of the Issuer
into any Parent Entity; provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no
material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such
merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise consummated in compliance with the terms
of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

(2) (a) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above
under the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (11)(b)

Investments made in reliance on clause (11) of the definition thereof);

fees, indemnities and expenses accrued in any prior year) and any termination fees (including
any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event,
including an initial public equity offering), or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof so
long as any such amendment or replacement is not materially disadvantageous, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of the Issuer, to the Holders when taken as a whole, as compared to the
Sponsor Management Agreement as in effect immediately prior to such amendment or
replacement, and (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar amounts to the Investors
and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors, in each case, approved by, or pursuant to
arrangements approved by, a majority of the members of the Board of the Issuer;

(4) the payment of reasonable and customary fees and compensation paid to, and
indemnities and reimbursements and employment and severance arrangements provided to or on
behalf of, or for the benefit of, former, current or future officers, directors, managers, employees

or any permitted transferee) of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent
Entity;

(5) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such
transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or
stating that the terms are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s
length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect or contemplated in the good faith
determination of the Issuer as of the Completion Date (other than any agreement or arrangement
of the type described in clause (3) above), or any amendment thereto (so long as any such
amendment is not disadvantageous in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the
Board of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer to the Holders when taken as a whole
as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Completion Date);

performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such Parent Entity) of
obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar

extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise

Issuer and the granting and performing of customary registration rights to any Parent Entity or to
any Permitted Holder or to any former, current or future director, manager, officer, employee or

to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor to:

(1) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that is a Guarantor on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or
participation in, or measured by, its profits, or

with the Indenture), or any other transaction entered into in connection with any such
acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or redesignation, in existence at the time
of such acquisition or at the time it merges, consolidates or amalgamates with or into the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets
from such Person or at the time it is redesignated (but, in each case, not created in

property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired or redesignated;

service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of
solely the property or assets of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject

193


-----

to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does
not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the
assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary;

(m) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred
subsequent to the Completion Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described

represent market terms at the time of incurrence or issuance and are imposed solely on
such Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries;

(n) restrictions contained in any documentation relating to any Permitted Receivables
Financing that, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Permitted Receivables Financing; and

(o) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or
obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (n) above; provided that such amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more restrictive with
respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to
such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding,
replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock
in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid
on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock
and (2) the subordination of loans and advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other
Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on
the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Domestic Subsidiaries that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (or
any Domestic Subsidiary that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary
incurs or guarantees Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities or guarantees Indebtedness in
respect of capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a Guarantor, a
Receivables Subsidiary or a FSHCO, to (i) incur or guarantee the payment of Indebtedness under any
Credit Facility permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii) guarantee Indebtedness
in respect of capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any other Guarantor in an aggregate
principal amount in excess of $50.0 million unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that
with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness
is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s
Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness

194


-----

shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as
such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other
rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such
Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that_
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection
with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in
its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become
a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 30 day period
described in clause (1) above.

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described
under “—Guarantees.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that following the Completion Date and so long as any Notes are
outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders:

(1) (x) audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, plus a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
and a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered
public accounting firm; (y) unaudited quarterly financial statements, subject to normal
year-end adjustments, plus a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”; and (z) with respect to the annual and quarterly
information, a presentation of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have no obligation to present any information by “pillar,”
segment or division or present any information on a constant currency basis,
notwithstanding such inclusion in the Offering Circular; and

(2) within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported,
such other information containing substantially the same information that would be required
to be contained in filings with the SEC on Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01
(which with respect to acquisitions, shall be only with respect to acquisitions that are
“significant” pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of “Significant Subsidiary” under
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X), 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01 and 5.02(b) (with respect to the
principal executive officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
and principal operating officer only) and (c) (other than with respect to information otherwise
required or contemplated by Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) as in
effect on the Issue Date if the Issuer were required to file such reports; provided, however,
that no such current report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a summary
of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or
understanding between the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or
executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries);

_provided, however, that (i) in no event shall such information or reports be required to comply with Rule_
3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC or contain separate financial statements for the
Issuer, the Guarantors or other Subsidiaries the shares of which are pledged to secure the Notes or
any Guarantee that would be required under (a) Section 3-09 of Regulation S-X to the extent that the

195


-----

Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such information would not be material to the Holders
or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (b) Section 3-10 of Regulation S-X or (c) Section 3-16 of Regulation S-X, respectively,
promulgated by the SEC, (ii) in no event shall such information or reports be required to comply with
Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with
respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, (iii) no such information or reports
referenced under clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good
faith judgment that such event is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations or
financial position of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) in no event shall
such information or reports be required to include any information that is not otherwise similar to
information currently included in the Offering Circular, other than with respect to reports provided under
clause (2) above and (v) in no event shall reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include
as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to
be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K except for (x) agreements evidencing material
Indebtedness and (y) historical and pro forma financial statements to the extent reasonably available
and, in any case with respect to pro forma financial statements, to include only pro forma revenues,
Consolidated EBITDA and capital expenditures in lieu thereof.

All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 120 days after the end of the
fiscal year to which they relate, and all such quarterly information and reports shall be furnished within
60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which they relate; provided that the annual information and
report for the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date shall be furnished within 150 days after the
end of such fiscal year; and provided further that the quarterly information and reports for the first fiscal
quarter ending prior to the Issue Date and the first three fiscal quarters ending after the Issue Date
shall be furnished within 75 days after the end of such applicable fiscal quarter.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and if any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either
on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, in the “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” or other comparable section, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

The Issuer will make available such information and reports (as well as the details regarding the
conference call described below) to the Trustee under the Indenture, to any Holder and, upon request,
to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information and reports on its
website, on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a
confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information and reports readily available to any
Holder, any bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, any securities analyst (to the extent providing
analysis of investment in the notes) or any market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such
information and reports as confidential or accesses such information and reports on Intralinks or any
comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality
acknowledgment; provided that the Issuer shall post such information thereon and make readily
available any password or other login information to any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker; provided, further, however, that the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to
any such Holder, prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of
such information and reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, prospective investors, security analysts or

196


-----

market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and
information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any
purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose
any such reports (and the information contained therein). The Issuer (or a Parent Entity) will hold a
quarterly conference call for all Holders and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of
investment in the Notes) to discuss such financial information (including a customary Q&A session) no
later than ten (10) Business Days after distribution of such financial information.

The Issuer shall provide S&P and Moody’s (and their respective successors) with information on
a periodic basis as S&P or Moody’s, as the case may be, shall reasonably require in order to maintain
public ratings of the Notes. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall
furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the
Securities Act.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this “Reports and Other
Information” covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial
and other information relating to any Parent Entity instead of the Issuer; provided that to the extent
such Parent Entity holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the
lesser of (i) 1% of consolidated revenues of such Parent Entity and (ii) 1% of the total consolidated
revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Entity, then such information related to such
Parent Entity shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Entity, on the one
hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the
other hand.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information
referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent
Entity has filed reports containing such information with the SEC.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section
“—Reports and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect
thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

The Trustee will have no duty to monitor, inquire as to or ascertain compliance with the covenants
described above.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Euro Notes
to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading thereon, and to maintain such
listing and admission so long as the Euro Notes are outstanding; provided that if (x) the Issuer is
unable to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, (y) maintenance of such listing
becomes unduly onerous, as reasonably determined by the Issuer or (z) the Authority requires
additional financial information from the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with
standards other than those accounting principles generally acceptable in the United States, then the
Issuer will, prior to the delisting of the Euro Notes from the Official List of the Exchange (if then listed
on the Official List of the Exchange), use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a
listing of the Euro Notes on another internationally “recognised stock exchange” (as defined in
Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom) (in which case, references in this
covenant to the Exchange will be deemed to be refer to such other “recognised stock exchange”) that

197


-----

would not cause the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries to become subject to Regulation (EU) No
596/2014 on market abuse (market abuse regulation) and any applicable delegated regulations
thereunder; provided, further, that if the Exchange or any such “recognised stock exchange” requires
the Issuer to publicly file its financial statements or requires publication of any financial information
from the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, then the Issuer shall not be required to maintain
any listing or admission to trading on the Exchange or any other exchange.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default” with respect to the
Notes of any series under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise,
of principal of, or premium, if any, on such series of Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to
such series of Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by
the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of such series of Notes then
outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the
Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period
of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this
clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or
any Permitted Receivables Financing), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is
created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods)
or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such
Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity;
and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, is in the aggregate, equal to the greater of (x) $100.0 million (or its foreign
currency equivalent) and (y) 12.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 12.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer
for the Applicable Measurement Period (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the
insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final
judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after
such judgment becomes final, and, in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an
enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree
which is not promptly stayed;

198


-----

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary; or

(7) the Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason
cease to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture) or be
declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such
effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) with respect to any
such series of Notes occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer
or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series by
notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other
monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes of such series to be due and payable
immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, interest and such
other monetary obligations will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, the principal,
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes will
become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or
any Holders. If a Default or Event of Default with respect to any series of Notes occurs and is
continuing of which the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee must send to each Holder of
the applicable series notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after receipt of such
notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders of the applicable
series notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, except a Default or Event of Default relating
to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding
notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of any series by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the
Notes of such series waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the
Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if
any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its
consequences with respect to the Notes of such series; provided such rescission would not conflict
with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in
clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting
payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes of any series) shall be annulled,
waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20
days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case
an Event of Default with respect to any series of Notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the applicable Holders unless the applicable Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce

199


-----

the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default with
respect to such series of Notes is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such
series have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of such series of Notes have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee
indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have
not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes of any series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that involves the Trustee in personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 30 days, upon
becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or
stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or their parent entities
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors, in their capacities as such,
under the Notes, the Guarantees, or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes of any series
or the Guarantees of any series, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and
will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes of such series issued under the Indenture. The
Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to
the Notes of any series and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee
of such series (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series when such payments are due solely out
of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes of such series concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

200


-----

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of
each Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described
in the Indenture, the Notes of any series and its Guarantee of such series, as applicable (“Covenant
_Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a_
Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series. In the event Covenant Defeasance
occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events
pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute
an Event of Default with respect to the applicable series of Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes
of any series:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, (x) in the case of Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Dollar Notes, cash in U.S. dollars,
Government Securities or a combination thereof for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar Notes
and (y) in the case of Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Euro Notes,
cash in euros, Government Securities or a combination thereof for the benefit of the Holders of
Euro Notes, in each case, in such amounts (including scheduled payments thereon) as will be
sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest), in the opinion of an Independent
Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the applicable
series of Notes on the stated maturity date or on the Redemption Date, as the case may be, and
the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
Redemption Date; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the relevant
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the relevant Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption
(any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the
Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee prior to or simultaneously with the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied
toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the
Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of

201


-----

such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be
applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Indebtedness, and, in each case the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have
occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or material instrument (other than the
Indenture) to which, the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each
case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding
any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions)
each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes of a series
issued thereunder, when either:

(1) all Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment
money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or

(2) (a) all such Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise,
will become due and payable within one year or may be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Guarantor
have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust
solely (x) in the case of a satisfaction and discharge of the Dollar Notes, cash in U.S. dollars,
Government Securities or a combination thereof for the benefit of the Holders of Dollar Notes,
and (y) in the case of a satisfaction and discharge of the Euro Notes, cash in euros, Government
Securities or a combination thereof for the benefit of the Holders of Euro Notes, in each case, in
such amounts (including scheduled payments thereon) as will be sufficient (without consideration
of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes of the
applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if
any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be; provided,
that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the relevant Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee equal to the relevant Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with
the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee prior to or simultaneously with the deposit

202


-----

of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
applied toward such redemption;

(b) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be
applied to make such deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) with respect
to the Indenture or the applicable series of Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on
the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or
material instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a
party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from
borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous
deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection
therewith);

(c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture
with respect to such series of Notes; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the applicable series of Notes at maturity or the
Redemption Date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any
Guarantee may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its
Affiliates, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the
Issuer or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or
exchange offer for the Notes); provided that (x) if any such amendment, supplement or waiver will only
affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then
only the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then
outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange
offer for Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms will affect a
series of Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to the manner such amendment or
waiver affects other series of Notes, then the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for Notes) shall be required.

The Indenture will provide that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately
preceding paragraph, without the consent of each Holder of Notes of the applicable series of Notes
affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes of such series whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

203


-----

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any Note of such series or
reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of the Notes of such series or change the time
at which the Notes of such series may be redeemed as described under “—Optional
Redemption”; provided that any amendment to the minimum notice requirement may be made
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on the Notes of such
series;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes of such series, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes of such
series by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
of such series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in
respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee which cannot be
amended or modified without the consent of each Holder of Notes of the applicable series
affected;

(5) make the Notes of such series payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults
or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes of such series;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right of any Holder expressly set forth in the Indenture and the
Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes of such series that would
adversely affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify or release the Guarantees of
any Significant Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the
Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes
and any Guarantee without the consent of any Holder of Notes of any series:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated
Notes or to alter the provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including the
related definitions) in a manner that does not materially adversely affect any Holder;

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders pursuant to the terms of the Indenture;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of
Notes of such series or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any
such Holder in any material respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders of Notes of such series or to surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes of such
series;

204


-----

(7) to provide for the issuance of additional Notes of such series in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture;

(8) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, if applicable;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee or a successor Paying Agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(10) to add a Guarantor with respect to the Notes of such series, a guarantee of a Parent
Entity with respect to the Notes of such series or a co-obligor of the Notes of such series;

(11) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes;

(13) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes of such series as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to
facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders of Notes of such series to transfer
Notes;

(14) to secure the Notes of such series and/or the related Guarantees;

(15) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted
or required by the Indenture; and

(16) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture, the Guarantees and/or the
Notes to eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or in the application thereof as described
in the last paragraph of the definition of “GAAP.”

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture or the Notes to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the Indenture
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) will be deemed
given on the first date on which publication is made, notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing or transmitting; notices sent by overnight delivery
service will be deemed given when delivered and notices given electronically will be deemed given
when sent. Notice given in accordance with the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will be deemed given on the date sent to DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest (as defined in
the Indenture), it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

205


-----

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of any series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes,
subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that at all times that an Event of Default with
respect to any series of Notes has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture, and use the same degree of care of and skill in their
exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or
her own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense with respect to
such exercise.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms to be used in the Indenture. For purposes of the
Indenture, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person
refers to such Person on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, but excluding from such
consolidation any Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Unrestricted Subsidiary were not an Affiliate of
such Person.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means, with respect to any specified Person,

(1) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged,
consolidated or amalgamated with or into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such
specified Person, including Indebtedness incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of,
such other Person merging, consolidating or amalgamating with or into or becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person; and

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For purposes of
this definition, “control” (including, with correlative meanings, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and
“under common control with”), as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the possession, directly
or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such
Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by agreement or otherwise.

“Applicable Calculation Date” means the applicable date of calculation for (i) the Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio, (ii) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, (iii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
(iv) the Consolidated EBITDA or (v) the Consolidated Total Assets.

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition and any actions or transactions related thereto
(including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments and Restricted
Payments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default
shall, at the option of the Issuer (which election may be made on the date of such acquisition), be the
date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into (or, if applicable,
the date of delivery of a binding offer, launch of a “certain funds” tender offer, delivery of an irrevocable

206


-----

notice, a declaration of a Restricted Payment, a dividend or a similar event) and such baskets or ratios
shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro
forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio after giving
effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and any actions or transactions related thereto) as if they
occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such
baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company for the Applicable
Measurement Period) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition and any actions or transactions related thereto, such baskets
or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes
of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets
or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition and any
actions or transactions related thereto; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such
determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions
(including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition unless and until such Limited Condition
Acquisition has been abandoned, as determined by the Issuer, prior to the consummation thereof.

“Applicable Measurement Period” means the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal
quarters of the Issuer immediately preceding the Applicable Calculation Date for which internal
financial statements are available.

“Applicable Premium” means with respect to any Note on any Redemption Date, the greater of:

(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(2) the excess, if any, of (a)(i) the sum of the present values at such Redemption Date of
(A) the redemption price of such Dollar Note or Euro Note, as applicable, at September 1, 2021
(such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing above under the caption “—Optional
Redemption”), plus (B) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note
through September 1, 2021, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at, in the case of the Dollar Notes,
the Treasury Rate, or, in the case of the Euro Notes, the Bund Rate, in each case as of such
Redemption Date plus 50 basis points, minus (ii) accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the Redemption Date over (b) the principal amount of such Note.

Calculation of the Applicable Premium will be made by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by
such Person as the Issuer shall designate; provided that such calculation or the correctness thereof
shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee.

“Asset Sale” means:

(1) the sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, of property or assets (including by way of a Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (each referred to in this definition as a
“disposition”); or

(2) the issuance or sale of Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries issued in compliance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”), whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions;

207


-----

in each case, other than:

(a) any disposition of cash, Cash Equivalents or Investment Grade Securities or
obsolete, damaged, unnecessary, unsuitable or worn out property or equipment or other

All Assets” or any disposition that constitutes a Change of Control pursuant to the Indenture;

(c) any disposition, issuance or sale in connection with the making of any Restricted
Payment that is permitted to be made, and is made, under the covenant described above
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted
Investment;

(d) any disposition of property or assets, or issuance or sale of Equity Interests of any
Restricted Subsidiary, in any transaction or series of related transactions with an aggregate
fair market value of less than the greater of (i) $100.0 million and (ii) 12.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period;

(e) any disposition of property or assets, or issuance of securities by a Restricted
Subsidiary, to the Issuer or by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to another Restricted

successor provision, any exchange of like property (excluding any boot thereon) for use in a

been subject to a casualty to the respective insurer of such property as part of an insurance
settlement or upon receipt of the net proceeds of such casualty event;

(j) sales of accounts receivables, or participations therein and related assets pursuant
to any Permitted Receivables Financing;

(l) any surrender or waiver of contractual rights or the settlement, release or surrender

necessary or advisable in the good faith determination of the Issuer to consummate any
acquisition permitted under the Indenture;

(t) any disposition of property or assets of a Foreign Subsidiary the Net Proceeds of
which the Issuer has determined in good faith that the repatriation of such Net Proceeds
(i) is prohibited or subject to limitations under applicable law, orders, decrees or
determinations of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority or (ii) would have a
material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit
actually realized in connection with such repatriation); provided that when the Issuer
determines in good faith that repatriation of any of such Net Proceeds (i) is no longer
prohibited or subject to limitations under such applicable law, orders, decrees or
determinations of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority or (ii) would no longer have

price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be
calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which Consolidated Total
Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based

223


-----

Trustee, to treat an Elected Amount under any Indebtedness which is to be Incurred (or any
commitment in respect thereof), as being Incurred as of the Applicable Calculation Date and (i) any
subsequent Incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment that was so treated (so long as the
total amount under such Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be an Incurrence of additional Indebtedness at such subsequent time,
(ii) the Issuer may revoke an election of an Elected Amount pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers (including the Merger), amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations
(as determined in accordance with GAAP) and operational changes that have been made by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Applicable Measurement Period or subsequent to such
Applicable Measurement Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Applicable Calculation
Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, disposed operations and operational changes
(and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA
resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period. If since the
beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning
of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition,
then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such
Applicable Measurement Period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement
Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro
_forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the_
Issuer (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, cost savings, operating
expense reductions and synergies resulting from any Asset Sale or other disposition or such
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation or other transaction
(including the Transactions), in each case calculated in accordance with and permitted by clause (2) of
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” herein). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest
and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate
in effect on the Applicable Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking
into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above,
interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be
computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or,
if lower, the maximum commitments under such revolving credit facility as of the Applicable Calculation
Date. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed
to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate
chosen as the Issuer may designate.

Standards Board or in such other statements by such other entity as have been approved by a
significant segment of the accounting profession, which are in effect from time to time; provided that all
terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be construed, and all
computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving effect
to any election under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or
any successor thereto (including pursuant to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification), to value
any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount
of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be determined in
accordance with the definition of Capitalized Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the
Issuer may elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election,
references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided
in the Indenture); provided that any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further,
any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP for periods that
include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as previously
calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election
made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an
election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of
Indebtedness.

If there occurs a change in generally accepted accounting principles and such change would
cause a change in the method of calculation of any standards, terms or measures used in a covenant
under “—Certain Covenants” as determined in good faith by the Issuer (an “Accounting Change”), then
the Issuer may elect in good faith, as evidenced by a written notice of the Issuer to the Trustee, to
amend any provision hereof, including any financial ratio calculations, thresholds or covenants, to
eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or in the application thereof occurring after the Issue
Date on the operation of such provision, regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after
such Accounting Change or in the application thereof, to reflect the effects of the Accounting Change,
including but not limited to amending the financial ratio calculations, thresholds and any financial

-----

covenant in the Indenture to recalibrate such financial ratio calculation, threshold and financial
covenant for the effects of the Accounting Change, so long as (1) such recalibration is limited to
changes in the calculation of such financial ratio calculations, thresholds or covenant levels due to the
effects of differences between GAAP as in effect on the Issue Date and any change occurring after the
Issue Date, (2) the recalibrated financial ratio calculations, thresholds or covenant levels shall be
determined in good faith and (3) any such recalibration shall be done in a manner such that, after
giving effect to such recalibration, the recalibrated thresholds and covenant levels shall be consistent
with the intention of the respective thresholds and covenant levels calculated under GAAP prior to such
notice.

for credit to an account of a participant (as defined below) or indirect participant (as defined below) in
DTC as described below. The notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment
in immediately available funds. Except as set forth below, the Dollar Notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the
closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Distribution Compliance
Period”), beneficial interests in the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes may be held only through
Euroclear and Clearstream (each as defined below) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless
transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Dollar Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with
the certification requirements described below.

Beneficial interests in the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial
interests in the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances
described below. See “—Exchanges Among Dollar Global Notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Dollar Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part,
only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the
Dollar Global Notes may not be dollar exchanged for dollar notes in certificated form (“Certificated
Dollar Notes”) except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Dollar Global
Notes for Certificated Dollar Notes.” Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Dollar Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in
certificated form.

-----

Dollar Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes) will
be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” Dollar Regulation S Notes will also be subject to certain restrictions on transfer
and will also bear the legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of
beneficial interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear or Clearstream),
which may change from time to time.

**_Depositary Procedures_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter
of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these
operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to
discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the
State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the
“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between
participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants
include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect
participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of
DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers
of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the
participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Dollar Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants
designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Dollar Global
Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of
ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with
respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect
to other owners of beneficial interests in the Dollar Global Notes).

Investors in the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold
their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes who are not
participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and
Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Investors in the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes
must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in
such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the
Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Dollar
Regulation S Global Notes through participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and
Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the

247


-----

books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and
Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Dollar Global Note may be subject to the
procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also
be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that
certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Dollar Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that
extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests
to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Dollar Global Notes will**
**not have dollar notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of dollar notes**
**in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under**
**the indenture governing the Dollar Notes for any purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Dollar Global Note
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered
holder under the indenture governing the Dollar Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the
Dollar Notes, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the dollar notes,
including the Dollar Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such dollar notes for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer or the Trustee, nor any
agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to
or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Dollar Global Notes or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or
indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Dollar
Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or
indirect participants.

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of
securities such as the dollar notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the
relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not
receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount
proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security
as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the
beneficial owners of dollar notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and
will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility
of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC
or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the dollar notes, and the Issuer and the
Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its
nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between
participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in
same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of dollar
notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests

248


-----

in the Dollar Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the
dollar notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if
there is an Event of Default under the dollar notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Dollar
Global Notes for legended dollar notes in certificated form, and to distribute such dollar notes to its
participants.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein,
cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf
of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such
cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within
the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures
for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants
may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in
the Dollar Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such
procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor
the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC
or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**_Exchange of Dollar Global Notes for Certificated Dollar Notes_**

A Dollar Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Dollar Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act
and, in each case, a successor depositary is not appointed;

(2) the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of
the Certificated Dollar Notes; or

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default with respect to the Dollar Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Dollar Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Dollar
Notes upon prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the
indenture governing the notes. In all cases, Certificated Dollar Notes delivered in exchange for any
Dollar Global Note or beneficial interests in Dollar Global Notes will be registered in the names, and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with
its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer
Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**_Exchange of Certificated Dollar Notes for Dollar Global Notes_**

Certificated Dollar Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Dollar Global Note
unless the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be provided in each
indenture governing the Dollar Notes) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such dollar notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

249


-----

**_Exchanges Among Dollar Global Notes_**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Dollar
Regulation S Global Note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S or qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Dollar Regulation S Global Note may be
exchanged for beneficial interests in a Dollar Rule 144A Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant notes pursuant to Rule
144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be provided in
the indenture governing the Dollar Notes) to the effect that the relevant notes are being
transferred to a Person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interest in a Dollar Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes
delivery in the form of an interest in the Dollar Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the
expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a
written certificate (in the form provided in each indenture governing the notes) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available)
and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the
interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests among the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes
and the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by
the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with
any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts
of the Dollar Regulation S Global Note and the Dollar Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the Dollar Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in another Dollar Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such
Dollar Global Note and will become an interest in such other Dollar Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in
such other Dollar Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of
DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration
of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**_Same Day Settlement and Payment_**

The Issuer will make payments in respect of the dollar notes represented by the Dollar Global
Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts specified by the Dollar Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of
principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Dollar Notes by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Dollar Notes or,
if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The dollar
notes represented by the Dollar Global Notes are expected to be made eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such
dollar notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer

250


-----

expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Dollar Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any
such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the
securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream)
immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer that cash received in
Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant to a participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but
will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**The Euro Global Notes**

**_General_**

The Euro Global Notes will be deposited, on the issue date, with the Common Depositary (as
defined under the caption “Description of Notes”) and registered in the name of the Common
Depositary or a nominee of the Common Depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream
(each as defined under the caption “Description of Notes”). Except as set forth below, the Euro Global
Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to a Common Depositary for Clearstream and
Euroclear or its nominee. No link is expected to be established among DTC and Clearstream or
Euroclear in connection with the issuance of the Euro Notes.

Ownership of interests in the Euro Rule 144A Global Note (the “Euro Rule 144A Book Entry
Interests”) and ownership of interests in the Euro Regulation S Global Note (the “Euro Regulation S
Book Entry Interests” and together with the Euro Rule 144A Book Entry Interests, the “Euro Book Entry
Interests”), will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons
that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Euro
Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective
names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, Euro Book Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Euro Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain States of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may
impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Euro Book Entry Interests. In addition, while the Euro
Notes are in global form, holders of Euro Book Entry Interests will not be considered holders of Euro
Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Euro Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Euro Global Notes for
all purposes under the indenture governing the Euro Notes (as defined under the caption “Description
of Notes”). In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Euro Book Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders of Euro Notes under the indenture governing the Euro Notes.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility, or be liable, for
any aspect of the records relating to the Euro Book Entry Interests, nor the action or inaction of
Euroclear, Clearstream or any common depositary.

251


-----

The Issuer has obtained the information in this section, “Book Entry, Delivery and Form,”
concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and the book-entry system and procedures from sourced that it
believes to be reliable, but the Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

**_Definitive Registered Euro Notes_**

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Euro Notes, owners of the Euro Book Entry
Interests will receive euro notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Euro Notes”), (1) if
Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary for the Euro Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120
days, (2) if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee and the applicable paying agent in writing that it
elects to cause the issuance of Definitive Registered Euro Notes or (3) if the owner of a Euro Book
Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following
an Event of Default and commencement of enforcement action under the indenture governing the Euro
Notes.

The Issuer understands that upon request by an owner of a Euro Book Entry Interest described in
the immediately preceding clause (3), Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s current procedure would be to
request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Euro Notes in definitive registered form to all
owners of Euro Book Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Euro Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream
or the Common Depositary, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures
and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Euro Book
Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Euro Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided
in the indenture governing the Euro Notes, unless that legend is not required by the indenture
governing the Euro Notes or applicable law. Should Definitive Registered Euro Notes be issued to
individual holders of the Euro Notes, a holder of Euro Notes who, as a result of trading or otherwise,
holds a principal amount of Euro Notes that is less than the minimum denomination of the Euro Notes
would be required to purchase an additional principal amount of Euro Notes such that its holding of
Euro Notes amounts to the minimum specified denomination.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee and the applicable paying agent each shall
be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Euro Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Euro Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the registrar, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Euro Notes; however,
owners of the Euro Book Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Redemption of the Euro Global Notes_**

In the event that any Euro Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Euro Book Entry Interests in such Euro
Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Euro Global Note.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Euro Book Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Euro Global Note (or any portion thereof).

The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer
than all of the Euro Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their

252


-----

participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Euro Book Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**_Payments on Euro Global Notes_**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Euro Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, interest and any Additional Amounts) to the applicable paying
agent, and such paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to the Common Depositary or its
nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The Common Depositary will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their customary procedures. All payments of principal and interest on
the Euro Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge
(and any interest, penalties and additions with respect thereto) unless required by applicable law or the
official interpretation or administration thereof. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions
and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Euro Book Entry Interests
held through such participants.

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Euro Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and any
agent of the Issuer or the Trustee will treat the registered holders of the Euro Global Notes (e.g.,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, any
paying agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

‰ any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Euro Book Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Euro Book Entry Interest;

‰ Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

‰ the records of the Common Depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Euro Book Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**_Action by Owners of Book Entry Interests_**

The Issuer understands that Euroclear and Clearstream will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Euro Notes (including the presentation of Euro Notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Euro Book Entry Interests in the
Euro Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of
Euro Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Euro Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default and
commencement of enforcement action under the indenture governing the Euro Notes, Euroclear and
Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Euro Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Euro
Global Notes for Definitive Registered Euro Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Euro
Notes to their respective participants.

**_Transfers_**

The Issuer understands that transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately
available funds. If a holder of Euro Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Euro Notes

253


-----

for any reason, including to sell Euro Notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interests in the Euro Global
Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the indenture governing the Euro Notes.

The Euro Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Prior to the
expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Euro Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be
transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S or qualified institutional buyers under Rule
144A. Book Entry Interests in the Euro Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and
certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.” Transfers of Euro Book Entry
Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Euro Book Entry Interests will at all times be subject to
such transfer restrictions.

Euro Rule 144A Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Euro Regulation S Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form to be provided in the indenture governing the Euro Notes) to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Euro Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of a Euro Rule 144A Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form to be provided in the indenture governing the Euro Notes) to the effect that
such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Euro Regulation S Book Entry Interest for
a Euro Rule 144A Book Entry Interest or an exchange of a Euro Rule 144A Book Entry Interest for a
Euro Regulation S Book Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in
the principal amount of the Euro Regulation S Global Note or Euro Rule 144A Global Note, as
applicable, and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Euro Rule 144A Global Note or
Euro Regulation S Global Note, as applicable.

Definitive Registered Euro Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Euro Book Entry
Interests in a Euro Global Note only in accordance with the provisions of the indenture governing the
Euro Notes, and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the
form to be provided in the indenture governing the Euro Notes) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Euro Notes. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

Any Euro Book Entry Interest is one of the Euro Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of a Euro Book Entry Interest in any other Euro Global Note will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Euro Book Entry Interest in the first mentioned Euro Global Note and become a
Euro Book Entry Interest in such other Euro Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to
all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Euro Book Entry Interests in such
other Euro Global Note for as long as it remains such a Euro Book Entry Interest.

**_Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

All Euro Book Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and

254


-----

procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement
system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer,
the Trustee, any paying agent or the initial purchasers is responsible for those operations or
procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book entry changes in the
accounts of such participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system,
or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form.
The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Euro Book Entry Interests.
In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the Euro Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**_Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book Entry System_**

The Issuer understands that transfers of interests in the Euro Global Notes between participants
in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Euro Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying
agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving the Euro Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear systems on
days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on
days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear systems on the same business day as in the United
States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Euro Notes, or to make or receive a
payment or delivery of the Euro Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be
performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether the
Clearstream or Euroclear system is used.

255


-----

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Euro Notes will be made in euros. Euro Book Entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Euro Book Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders of notes on the Business Day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Euro Book Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and
will settle in same day funds. The Issuer understands that, since the purchase determines the place of
delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Euro Book Entry Interests where both
the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the
desired value date.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes and note guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes will not have the benefit of any registration
rights. The Notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from, or not subject to,
registration requirements under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
Accordingly, we are offering the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional
buyers (a “QIB”) pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and, outside the United States, to
non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to represent, warrant, and agree as follows (terms used
in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act are used
herein as defined therein):

(1) It is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act) of the Issuer
and that it (A) (i) is a QIB, (ii) is acquiring the Notes for its own account or for the account of a QIB and
(iii) is aware that the initial purchasers are selling the Notes to it in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) is not a
U.S. person, as such term is defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act, and is acquiring the Notes in
an offshore transaction pursuant to Regulation S.

(2) It understands that the Notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public
offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes have not been and
will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it decides to offer, resell,
pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes, such Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise
transferred only (i) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person whom
the seller reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A,
(ii) outside the United States to a non-U.S. person in a transaction complying with the provisions of
Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act, including provided by Rule 144 (if available and provided that prior to such transfer, the trustee is
furnished with an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company that such transfer is in compliance
with the Securities Act), (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
(v) to us or any of our subsidiaries, in each of cases (i) through (v) in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any State of the United States, and that (B) it will, and each subsequent holder is
required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in
clause (A) above.

(3) It understands that the Notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND
THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN

TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY
RULE 144 THEREUNDER (IF APPLICABLE) OR (d) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANOTHER
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT (AND

PROVIDED BY RULE 144 FOR RESALE OF THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY.”

IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY OR ANY INTEREST
HEREIN WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD REFERRED TO ABOVE, THE HOLDER MUST CERTIFY
TO THE REGISTRAR THE MANNER OF SUCH TRANSFER. AS USED HEREIN THE TERMS
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,” “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANING

BY ITS ACQUISITION OF THIS SECURITY, THE HOLDER HEREOF WILL BE DEEMED
TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT EITHER (I) IT IS NOT ACQUIRING OR

AMENDED (THE “CODE”), OR PROVISIONS UNDER ANY OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL,
NON-U.S. OR OTHER LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO SUCH PROVISIONS
OF ERISA OR THE CODE (COLLECTIVELY, “SIMILAR LAWS”), OR (C) ENTITY WHOSE

MEANING OF 29 C.F.R. SECTION 2510.3-101, AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 3(42) OF ERISA)
OF ANY SUCH PLAN, ACCOUNT OR ARRANGEMENT DESCRIBED IN CLAUSE (A) OR (B),

VIOLATION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS.

ADDITIONALLY, IF THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY IS USING ASSETS OF ANY PLAN
SUBJECT TO PART 4 OF TITLE I OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (AN “ERISA
PLAN”) TO ACQUIRE OR HOLD THIS SECURITY, THEN SUCH HOLDER WILL BE DEEMED
TO REPRESENT THAT NONE OF THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS, OR ANY OF ITS
OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HAS ACTED AS THE ERISA PLAN’S FIDUCIARY, OR
HAS BEEN RELIED UPON FOR ANY ADVICE, WITH RESPECT TO ITS DECISION TO
ACQUIRE, HOLD, SELL, EXCHANGE, VOTE OR PROVIDE ANY CONSENT WITH RESPECT
TO THE NOTES AND NONE OF THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS, OR ANY OF ITS
OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL AT ANY TIME BE RELIED UPON AS THE ERISA
PLAN’S FIDUCIARY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DECISION TO ACQUIRE, CONTINUE TO
HOLD, SELL, EXCHANGE, VOTE OR PROVIDE ANY CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS
SECURITY.

-----

Each Note being sold pursuant to Regulation S will bear an additional legend substantially
to the following effect unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR DELIVERED IN THE
UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY U.S. PERSON,
UNLESS SUCH NOTES ARE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS THEREOF IS AVAILABLE. THIS
LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF FORTY DAYS FROM THE LATER
OF (i) THE DATE ON WHICH THESE NOTES WERE FIRST OFFERED AND (ii) THE DATE OF
ISSUE OF THESE NOTES.

(4) If such purchaser is an acquirer in a transaction that occurs outside the United States within
the meaning of Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the “40-day distribution
compliance period” within the meaning of Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act, any offer
or sale of these Notes shall not be made by such purchaser to a U.S. person or for the account or
benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act, except in compliance
with applicable securities laws. It (a) is able to act on its own behalf in the transactions contemplated
by this offering circular, (b) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its prospective investment in the Notes and (c) (or the
account for which it is acting) has the ability to bear the economic risks of its prospective investment in

(5) It acknowledges that (a) none of us, the initial purchasers or any person acting on behalf of
any of the foregoing has made any statement, representation or warranty, express or implied, to it with
respect to the Company or the offer or sale of any Notes, other than the information we have included
in this offering circular, (b) any information it desires concerning the Company, the Notes or any other
matter relevant to its decision to acquire the Notes (including a copy of the offering circular) is or has
been made available to it and (c) the initial purchasers have made no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of the offering circular.

(6) (a) Either (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire or hold the Notes or any interest

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (”ERISA”), (B) plan, individual
retirement account or other arrangement that is subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (plans subject to such sections of ERISA and the Code,

whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement
described in clause (A) or (B) or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes or any interest therein will
not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws and (b) each
purchaser or transferee that is or is acquiring a Note or any interest therein with the assets of an
ERISA Plan (including, but not limited to, an entity whose assets are “plan assets”) will be deemed to
represent and warrant that none of the Company, the guarantors and the initial purchasers (the
“Transaction Parties”), or any of their respective affiliates has acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary, or
has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser’s or transferee’s decision to acquire,
hold, sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with respect to the Notes and none of the
Transaction Parties or any of their respective affiliates shall at any time be relied upon as the ERISA
Plan’s fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold, sell, exchange, vote or
provide any consent with respect to the Notes.

accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any
of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements deemed to have been made by it
are no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the initial purchasers. If such purchaser is acquiring the
Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, such purchaser represents that it has
sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such account.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
the Notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, plans, individual retirement
accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, or provisions under
any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other Similar Laws, and entities whose underlying assets
are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other
interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority
or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the
assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to
such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within
the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. Plans that are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(2)
of the Code), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the
Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions under
other applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect
to which any of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates is considered a
party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is
acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction
class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation: PTCE 84-14, respecting transactions determined by
independent qualified professional asset managers; PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts; PTCE 91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds; PTCE 95-60, respecting
life insurance company general accounts; and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by
in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
for certain transactions, provided that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their
respective affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or

261


-----

render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction
and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, nor pays any more than “adequate
consideration” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code) in connection with the transaction. Each of the above noted exceptions contains certain
conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holding
the Notes in reliance of any of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to
ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will
be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing
“plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will
be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by or on
behalf of such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes
assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by such
purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar
Laws.

Additionally, if any purchaser or subsequent transferee of the Notes is using assets of any ERISA
Plan to acquire or hold the Notes, such purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to
represent that none of us, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates has acted as
the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser’s or
transferee’s decision to acquire, hold, sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with respect to the
Notes and none of us, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates shall at any time
be relied upon as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold,
sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive and should
not be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that
fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any
Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the
purchase and holding of the Notes. Each purchaser or subsequent transferee has exclusive
responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of Notes (or any interest therein) does not
violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or the provisions of applicable
Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by us, the initial
purchasers or any of our or their affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant
legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or that such
investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and, in the case of Non-U.S.
Holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
Notes as of the date hereof.

This summary deals only with Notes held as capital assets (generally, assets held for investment)
that are purchased for cash pursuant to this offering at their initial “issue price” (the first price at which
a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses,
brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or
wholesaler)), and does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws, including if you are:

‰ a dealer in securities or currencies;

‰ a financial institution;

‰ a regulated investment company;

‰ a real estate investment trust;

‰ a tax-exempt entity;

‰ an insurance company;

‰ a controlled foreign corporation;

‰ a passive foreign investment company;

‰ a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

‰ a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your
securities;

‰ a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

‰ a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes;

‰ a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the
Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement;

‰ a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar; or

‰ a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a
retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different
from those summarized below. We have not sought, and will not seek, any rulings from the IRS
regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions
concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are
different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and
estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United
States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any
particular purchaser of Notes.

263


-----

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

**If you are considering purchasing Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors**
**concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of**
**the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you**
**arising under any other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing**
**jurisdiction.**

**Treatment of the Notes**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes— Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption” and “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,”),
we may be required to redeem or repurchase the Notes significantly earlier than their scheduled
maturity date and/or pay amount in excess of stated interest and principal on the Notes. The foregoing
contingencies may implicate the provisions of the United States Treasury regulations relating to
“contingent payment debt instruments.” However, we believe and intend to take the position that the
foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt
instrument rules. Our position is binding on you unless you disclose that you are taking a contrary
position in the manner required by applicable United States Treasury regulations. However, the
position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, you might be
required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes, and to
treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a
Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. Holders of the Notes are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding
the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the
consequences thereof.

**Effect of the Merger**

We intend to take the position that the Merger will not result in a taxable event to holders of the
Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. Our position, however, is not binding on the IRS.
If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, the Merger may result in a taxable event to
holders of the Notes, and such taxable event could cause the amount and timing of a holder’s income
with respect to the Notes to differ from that otherwise described herein. This discussion assumes that
the Merger will not result in a taxable event to holders of the Notes for United States federal income tax
purposes. Prospective holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible United
States federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will
apply to you if you are a U.S. Holder.

“U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for United States federal income tax
purposes:

‰ an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

‰ a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

264


-----

‰ an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or

‰ a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

**_Dollar Notes_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a Dollar Note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it
is paid or accrued, in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax
purposes.

_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Dollar Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Dollar Note,
you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized
upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount
attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income for
United States federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously included in income) and the
adjusted tax basis of the Dollar Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Dollar Note will, in general, be your
U.S. dollar cost for that Note. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and
will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Dollar Note for more than one year.
Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Euro Notes_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a Euro Note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is
paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax
purposes.

If you use the cash method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will
be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest received on the
Euro Notes, determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate for euros on the date such
payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will
not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (but
may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the disposition of the euros so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you
may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to stated interest on the Euro Notes in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income
for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued on the Euro Notes
held during such year, determined by translating such stated interest at the average rate of exchange
for the period or periods (or portions thereof) within such year during which such stated interest
accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate
on:

‰ the last day of the accrual period;

‰ the last day of the taxable year, if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or

265


-----

‰ the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the
end of the accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt
instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

If you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Euro
Note (including, upon the sale or other disposition of a Euro Note, the receipt of amounts attributable to
accrued stated interest previously included in income), you will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss (generally taxable as United States source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the
euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the
stated interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined
above).

_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Euro Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, you
will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon
the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to
any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income for United States
federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously included in income) and the adjusted tax basis
in the Euro Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Euro Note will, in general, be your U.S. dollar cost for
that Note. Your U.S. dollar cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such Euro
Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Euro Note is sold, exchanged,
retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros, then your amount
realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. If, however, you are a cash method taxpayer and
the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax
purposes, euros received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of
the sale or other taxable disposition. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States
federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the sale or other
taxable disposition of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that such
election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method taxpayer that does not make the
election described above will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as
United States source ordinary income or loss) upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Euro Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the euros received
(based on the spot rate on the settlement date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized
on the disposition date.

Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below,
any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if you have held the Euro Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Euro Note may be treated
as foreign currency exchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will generally be
treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of
the Euro Note is your purchase price for the Euro Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase,
and the amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference

266


-----

between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Euro Note (or, possibly, in
the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement date of such disposition,
provided the Euro Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States
federal income tax purposes) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the
spot rate on the date you purchased the Euro Note. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or
loss recognized on the disposition of a Euro Note (with respect to both principal and accrued stated
interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the Euro
Note.

_Disposition of Euros_

Your tax basis in euros received as stated interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof
at the spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a
sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the euros will generally be treated as foreign currency
exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as United States source ordinary income or loss).

_Reportable Transactions_

United States Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including
certain foreign currency transactions. Under the United States Treasury regulations, certain
transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, or euros received in
respect of a Euro Note, to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of
Euro Notes, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if
any, with respect to an investment in such Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences
that will apply to you if you are a Non-U.S. Holder of Notes. “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial
owner of a Note, other than an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes, that is not a U.S. Holder (as defined under “—U.S. Holders” above).

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and FATCA, United States
federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the Notes under the “portfolio
interest exemption,” provided that:

‰ interest paid on the Notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States;

‰ you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of voting stock of the Issuer within the meaning of the Code and applicable United
States Treasury regulations;

‰ you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer through stock
ownership;

‰ you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the Notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code; and

267


-----

‰ either (a) you provide a properly completed applicable IRS Form W-8, including your name and
address and a certification, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person
as defined under the Code or (b) you hold your Notes through certain foreign intermediaries
and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations.
Special certification rules apply to Non-U.S. Holders that are pass-through entities rather than
corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be
subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding
agent with a properly executed:

‰ IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

‰ IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the Notes is not
subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income
Tax”).

United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you
will be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you
will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification
requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied) in generally
the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you
are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable
income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain
adjustments.

Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and FATCA, any gain realized on
the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be
subject to United States federal income tax unless:

‰ the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment or fixed base), in which case you will be subject to United States federal income
tax (and possibly branch profits tax) on such gain in the same manner as described above with
respect to effectively connected interest; or

‰ you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject
to United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) on such gain (net of certain United States source losses).

**_United States Federal Estate Tax_**

If you are an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident (as specifically defined for United
States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the time of your death, your estate will not
be subject to United States federal estate tax on Notes beneficially owned (or deemed to be

268


-----

beneficially owned) by you at the time of your death, provided that any interest payment to you on the
Notes would be eligible for exemption from United States federal withholding tax under the “portfolio
interest rule,” described above under “—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” without regard to the
statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest and to the
proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to
you (unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding may apply to such
payments and proceeds if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or a certification that you
are not subject to backup withholding, or if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments
generally will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which
you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, you will not be subject to
backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the Notes that we make to you provided
that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a
United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you
the required certification that you are a Non-U.S. Holder described above in the fifth bullet point under
“—Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the
proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of Notes within
the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless
you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a Non-U.S. Holder (and the payor does
not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the
Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as
“FATCA”), a 30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income paid on the
Notes and, for a disposition of a Note occurring after December 31, 2018, the gross proceeds from
such disposition, in each case paid to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically defined in the
Code, and which may include entities in addition to banks and traditional financial institutions, such as
investment funds and certain holding companies) which does not provide sufficient documentation,
typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its
compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance
with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids withholding, or
(ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient

269


-----

documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or
(y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such entity (if
any). If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding
tax discussed above under “—Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” the
withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. If
you are a foreign financial entity or a non-financial foreign entity in a jurisdiction that has entered into
an intergovernmental agreement with the United States, you may be subject to different rules. You
should consult your own tax advisor regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

One or more of the initial purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for
sales of the Notes in jurisdictions in which such initial purchasers are not otherwise permitted.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers
have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the purchase agreement
if any of the Notes are purchased. The purchase agreement also provides that if an initial purchaser
defaults the purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the
offering may be terminated. The initial purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts
under the purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this
offering circular.

The initial purchasers propose to offer each series of the Notes initially at the offering prices on
the cover page of this offering circular and may also offer the Notes to selling group members at the
offering price less a selling concession. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. The
initial purchasers may also offer and sell the Notes to investment funds managed by affiliates of the
Sponsor at a discount from the offering price set forth on the cover of this offering circular.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial
purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities
Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

271


-----

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the
initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the offering or the date the Notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom it sells such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to
Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering, or the date the Notes
are originally issued, an offer or sale of Notes within the U.S. by a broker/dealer that is not participating
in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the
date specified on the cover of this offering circular, which is the tenth business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days,
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding seven (7) business days will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes
during the period described above should consult their own advisor.

**General**

We, Merger Sub and the guarantors have agreed that, for a period of 90 days after the date
hereof, we will not, directly or indirectly, (i) offer for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any
transaction or device that is designed to, or would be expected to, result in the disposition by any
person at any time in the future of) any capital markets debt securities of Merger Sub, the Company or
the guarantors substantially similar to each series of Notes or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such debt securities of Merger Sub, the Company or the guarantors, or sell or grant
options, rights or warrants with respect to such debt securities of Merger Sub, the Company or the
guarantors or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such debt securities of Merger Sub, the
Company or the guarantors, (ii) except as otherwise disclosed, enter into any swap or other derivative
transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of
ownership of such debt securities of Merger Sub, the Company or the guarantors, whether any such
transaction described in clause (i) above or this clause (ii) is to be settled by delivery of debt securities
of Merger Sub, the Company or the guarantors or other securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly
announce an offering of any debt securities of Merger Sub, the Company or the guarantors
substantially similar to the Notes or securities convertible or exchangeable into such debt securities, in
each case without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.

We and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities that
could arise from the use of this offering circular or to contribute to payments which they may be
required to make in that respect.

Each series of Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The initial
purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and
any market making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion without notice. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. We do not
intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in
any automated quotation system. We intend to apply to list the Euro Notes to be admitted to trading on
the Official List of the Exchange in a reasonable period following the issue date of the Euro Notes. The

272


-----

Exchange is not a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.
The listing application for the Euro Notes will be subject to approval by the Authority. There is no
assurance that the application will be successful or that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to
trading on the Exchange. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the
Issuer making an application for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover
positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater
number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the Notes while the offering is in progress.

The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial
purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased Notes sold by or for the account of such
initial purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for
their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a
result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any
time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have from time to time
performed, various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking and other related
services for the Sponsor, us, the Guarantors and our affiliates for which they have received customary
compensation, and they may continue to do so in the future.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed to become agents,
arrangers, book-runners, managers or lenders under the Credit Facilities and will receive customary
fees and expenses in connection therewith. Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, is the
administrative agent and collateral agent for the Existing Credit Facilities. Certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates are agents and lenders to us and our subsidiaries under our
Existing Credit Facilities and accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
through the repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities if such funds
are released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger. See “Use of Proceeds.” Certain of the
initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are also acting as joint lead arrangers with respect to the
Credit Facilities and may become lenders thereunder, for which they expect to receive customary
compensation. In addition, the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have also agreed to
provide interim financing to the Issuer with respect to an unsecured bridge facility to finance a portion
of the Merger under certain circumstances in the event that the offering of the Notes is not
consummated, for which these initial purchasers will be paid customary fees. These bridge
commitments will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of this offering. See
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are serving as financial
advisors to the selling stockholders of Boxer Parent Company in connection with the Merger, for which
they will receive customary fees. Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor
to KKR in connection with the Merger, for which it will similarly receive customary fees. In addition,

273


-----

KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of KKR, and therefore an affiliate
of Parent and the Issuer. KKR Capital Markets LLC will also act as a joint lead arranger for the Credit
Facilities. For a description of certain related party arrangements to be effective from and after the
consummation of the Merger, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition,
certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have been engaged as placement agents
for the issuance and sale of the PIK Preferred Equity and will receive fees and commissions in
connection therewith.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of
investments, serve as hedge counterparties in foreign currency hedge agreements and actively trade
debt and equity securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other
financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such
investment and other activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of Merger
Sub or the Company (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) or persons and
entities with relationships with Merger Sub or the Company. The initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading
ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or
instruments and may at any time hold for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, or
recommend to clients that they acquire long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and
instruments.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this
provision:

i. a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

A. a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or

B. a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, as amended, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II; or

C. not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive; and

ii. the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable
an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes.

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering circular is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the Netherlands**

section 217(1) of Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code to conclude a contract to purchase or otherwise
acquire the Notes, or to issue an invitation to make an offer of the Notes, or (ii) the placement of the

and the offering circular has not been and/ or will not be published pursuant to the Austrian Capital
Market Act. The Notes may only be marketed to investors in Austria on the basis of, and in accordance
with, an exemption from the obligation to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 3 of the Austrian
Capital Market Act. Accordingly, the Notes may not be, and are not being, offered or advertised
publicly and the Notes will only be available to, and this offering circular and any other offering material
in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons to whom such offer or disclosure may be lawfully
made. Any resale of the Notes in Austria may only be made in accordance with the Austrian Capital
Market Act and other applicable laws and in any case only on the basis of, and in accordance with, an
exemption from the obligation to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 3 of the Austrian Capital
Market Act.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

**To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boxer Parent Company Inc.**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Boxer Parent Company
Inc., which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related
consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2018, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to
the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Boxer Parent Company Inc. at March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**BOXER PARENT COMPANY INC.**
**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Basis of Presentation_**

On September 10, 2013 (the Acquisition Date), Boxer Parent Company Inc. (the Parent) acquired
BMC Software, Inc. (BMC) (the Acquisition), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
May 6, 2013 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), through its subsidiary, BMC Software Finance, Inc.
(BSFI). The Parent is a Delaware corporation whose majority shareholders are Bain Capital Private
Equity, LP, Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc., Insight Venture Management, LLC and a company
affiliated with GIC (Ventures) Pte. Ltd. (together, the Sponsors). Unless otherwise stated or unless the
context otherwise requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of
our subsidiaries and are prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. We have evaluated subsequent events through June 15, 2018, the date
these financial statements are available for issuance.

**_Nature of Operations_**

We provide IT Operations Management software solutions to help our customers monitor,
manage, automate and secure their mission-critical IT workloads across hybrid environments, whether
mobile, multi-cloud, client-server or mainframe. Our portfolio of solutions helps customers ensure
seamless IT operations and performance across applications and infrastructure by managing the IT
systems and processes that enable mission-critical business functions. In addition to licensing our
software under both perpetual and term license models for on-premises use, we provide on-demand
software-as-a-service (SaaS) and managed services offerings delivered through hosted solutions. We
also provide our customers with maintenance and support services for our products and assist
customers with software implementation, integration, IT process and organizational transformation and
education services.

**_New Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted_**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments in 2015,
2016 and 2017 (collectively, Topic 606 or the Standard). Topic 606 supersedes nearly all revenue
recognition guidance under previously existing GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize
revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step
process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is likely that more judgment and estimates
may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under previously existing
GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs
related to obtaining customer contracts and requires enhanced disclosures. Topic 606 is effective for
the Company in fiscal year 2020 and early adoption is permitted. Topic 606 may be applied
retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective method) or with the cumulative effect
recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We anticipate adopting
Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the full retrospective method.

F-7


-----

While the Company is continuing to determine the full impact of Topic 606, it currently anticipates
the Standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures, and believes the most significant effect relates to the timing of the recognition of software
license revenue. Specifically, under Topic 606, the Company currently expects to recognize
substantially all software license revenue, in both perpetual licensing and term licensing arrangements,
at the point in time the licensed software is transferred to the customer. This represents a substantial
change to our application of previously existing GAAP, under which a substantial portion of our
perpetual license revenue and all of our term license revenue is generally deferred and recognized
ratably, most commonly over the term of the associated maintenance arrangements but in some cases
over the longest expected delivery period of other undelivered elements in the arrangement. As a
result, the Company also anticipates a significant reduction in deferred license revenue upon adoption
of Topic 606, principally relating to the cumulative earlier recognition of deferred license revenue
recognized upon software transfer to our customers. The Company currently believes that the
point-in-time recognition requirement of Topic 606 will increase the volatility of its revenue and
earnings period to period. The Company does not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant
effect on the timing of revenue recognition for its maintenance, SaaS and professional services
contracts.

Under Topic 606, a larger portion of the Company’s sales commissions and other incremental
costs to acquire contracts will be subject to capitalization as compared to our application of previously
existing GAAP. However, incremental costs related to software license deliverables will be expensed
as incurred whereas under our application of current GAAP, a portion of such costs are capitalized and
amortized commensurate with the timing of software license revenue recognition. Additionally, the
Company currently anticipates that it will amortize incremental costs related to new customer business
over an expected period of benefit of approximately five years, which is generally longer than
amortization periods utilized under our application of previously existing GAAP. The Company is
currently assessing the potential financial statement impact of these new requirements.

The Company is also currently assessing the income tax impacts related to Topic 606, mostly
relating to the potential impacts from earlier recognition of revenue and the associated reduction in
deferred revenue under the Standard. Subject to the Company’s overall tax attributes and other
factors, the adoption of Topic 606 could result in an increase in income taxes payable and accelerated
cash tax payment requirements in periods subsequent to adoption of the Standard in comparison to
existing tax treatment.

We do not believe Topic 606 will have a material impact on the timing of our customer contract
billings and cash receipts, and thus on our operating or free cash flows, other than the potential tax
impacts noted above.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue
recognition, valuation of goodwill, valuation of intangible assets as well as their associated useful lives,
valuation of share-based compensation, capitalization and amortization of software development costs,
the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and accounting for unrecognized tax benefits.

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

We consider highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash equivalents were comprised
of foreign certificates of deposit. Our cash equivalents are subject to potential credit risk.

Our restricted cash balances are primarily comprised of cash balances that are pledged as
collateral for letters of credit and balances that have been collected in our capacity as servicer for
financial institutions related to trade finance receivable balances that have been transferred to the
financial institutions. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding trade finance receivables.

**_Receivables_**

In the ordinary course of business, we extend credit to our customers on both trade and financed
terms. Trade and finance receivables are recorded at their outstanding principal balances, adjusted for
interest receivable to date, if applicable, and adjusted by the allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest
income on finance receivables is recognized using the effective interest method and is presented as
other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Interest income on
these finance receivables was $6.5 million, $4.5 million and $5.6 million during the years ended
March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we
consider the length of time receivable balances have been outstanding, historical collection
experience, current economic conditions and customer-specific information. When we ultimately
conclude that a receivable is uncollectible, the balance is charged against the allowance for doubtful
accounts. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable was
$3.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively. There was no allowance for doubtful trade finance
receivables at March 31, 2018 and 2017. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the
provision (recovery) for bad debts was $0.6 million, $(0.2) million and $1.8 million, respectively, and the
amounts written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $1.1 million, $3.1 million and
$1.6 million, respectively.

**_Long-lived and Indefinite-lived Assets_**

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment, other
than leasehold improvements, is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from three to ten years.

Costs incurred to develop internal-use software (including software used to deliver SaaS) during
the application development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Application development
stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding,
installation and testing. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional
functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and
enhancements are expensed as incurred.

**_Software Development Costs_**

Costs of software developed internally for licensing to third parties are expensed until the
technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software
development costs incurred through the general release of the software products are capitalized and

F-9


-----

subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Costs of software
developed using agile development methods are generally expensed as incurred because the
development efforts between technological feasibility and general release of the software products are
insignificant. Capitalized software development costs are then amortized using the greater of an
amount determined by the ratio of current revenues recognized to the total anticipated revenues for a
product or straight-line over the product’s estimated economic life beginning at the date of general
availability of the product to our customers. The amortization of capitalized software development costs
related to share-based compensation is included in cost of license, maintenance and SaaS revenue;
the remaining amortization, including any amounts accelerated for products that are not expected to
generate sufficient future revenue to realize their carrying values, is included in depreciation and
amortization expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. During the year ended
March 31, 2018, amounts capitalized were $9.8 million (including $0.4 million of capitalized interest
and $0.4 million of share-based compensation costs), and amounts amortized were $64.2 million
(including $2.7 million related to share-based compensation costs). During the year ended March 31,
2017, amounts capitalized were $21.5 million (including $1.0 million of capitalized interest and
$1.0 million of share-based compensation costs), and amounts amortized were $77.6 million (including
$3.7 million related to share-based compensation costs). During the year ended March 31, 2016,
amounts capitalized were $47.4 million (including $2.3 million of capitalized interest and $1.2 million of
share-based compensation costs), and amounts amortized were $68.0 million (including $3.4 million
related to share-based compensation costs).

**_Definite-lived Intangible Assets_**

Definite-lived intangible assets at March 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted principally of acquired
technology, customer relationships and certain product-related trademarks and tradenames recorded
in connection with the Acquisition, as well as subsequent acquisitions. Definite-lived intangible assets
are amortized over their respective estimated economic lives, ranging from three to fifteen years, either
on a straight-line basis or using a method more representative of the time pattern over which the
benefit is derived.

**_Impairment of Long-lived Assets_**

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the
useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. If there is an impairment indicator, a quantitative
test is performed based on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded value
of the asset or asset group. If the asset or asset group fails this quantitative test, the asset or asset
group is written down to its estimated fair value.

**_Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets_**

Indefinite-lived intangible assets at March 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of our corporate
trademark and tradename recorded in connection with the Acquisition. The indefinite-lived intangible
assets are not subject to amortization and thus are assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is
impaired. If, after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not
more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, we are not required to take any further
action. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on January 1 of each year.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date
fair value of identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed

F-10


-----

in connection with our business combinations. Upon acquisition, goodwill is assigned to the reporting
units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. A reporting unit is
the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete
financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. If a reorganization
causes the Company’s reporting units to change, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units based on
their relative fair values.

We assess goodwill for impairment as of January 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced
below its carrying value. When conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a three
step process. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, using an
assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, we are required to
make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic
conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future
financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they
operate. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for
impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we
perform a second step for that reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill
impairment. This quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit
and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, determined using a combination of the
income and market approaches on an invested capital basis, to its respective carrying value (including
goodwill) as of the date of the impairment test. The third step, employed for any reporting unit whose
carrying value exceeds its fair value, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and
compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If a reporting
unit’s carrying value is negative, the Company does not follow this three-step process, and instead
performs a qualitative evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s
goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more likely than not impaired, the third step discussed above
is performed to determine if there is an impairment and measure the amount of any potential
impairment.

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Risk Management_**

We operate globally and transact business in various foreign currencies. The functional currency
for many of our foreign subsidiaries is the respective local currency. The balance sheets of these
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the currency exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet dates. Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars
using the average exchange rates during the period, on a monthly basis. The substantial majority of
our revenue derived from customers outside the United States is billed in local currencies from regional
headquarters. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact the translated
amount of revenue and expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
Balance sheet translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within
stockholders’ deficit. We also have foreign currency exposure related to foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable and intercompany balances. Foreign currency
transaction gains or losses on these balance sheet exposures are included in other income (expense),
net, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We derive revenue principally from software-related arrangements consisting of software license
and maintenance offerings, non-software arrangements consisting of our SaaS offerings as well as the

F-11


-----

associated professional services for each of these types of arrangements. We recognize revenue when
all of the following core revenue recognition criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the license or service has occurred; (iii) the arrangement fee is fixed
or determinable and (iv) collection of the arrangement fee is probable.

**_Software License and Maintenance Arrangements_**

Software license revenue is recognized upfront on perpetual license sales when the core revenue
recognition criteria above are satisfied and vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value
of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple-element
arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use
the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual
method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those
elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We
have established VSOE of the fair value of our maintenance offerings through independent
maintenance renewals. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a
percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of
the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand-alone
basis, as well as management-approved pricing for certain new offerings.

We are unable to establish VSOE of the fair value for all undelivered elements in certain
arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is
based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list
prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of the fair value of all undelivered elements in certain
arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to
future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of the fair value of
one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon
delivery of those elements or when VSOE of the fair value exists for all remaining undelivered
elements, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably
over the longest expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is
typically the longest maintenance term.

In our time-based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of the fair value of
undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements
are the same duration as the license terms, and VSOE of the fair value of maintenance cannot be
established. Accordingly, license and maintenance fees in time-based license arrangements are
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements and are included in term license and
maintenance revenue in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the maintenance
arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years and in some instances can extend up to
five or more years.

**_Professional Services Arrangements_**

Professional services revenue, which principally relates to consulting, implementation and
education services associated with our products, is derived under both time-and-material and fixed fee
arrangements. In most fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized on a proportional performance
basis based on days of effort. If no discernible customer deliverable exists until the completion of the
professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of
professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed
completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license

F-12


-----

arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not
involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise
considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the
professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined
software license and professional services revenue is recognized based on contract accounting using
either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.

**_SaaS Arrangements_**

SaaS subscription fees are recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the subscription
arrangements beginning on the date that the service is made available to customers. Additional
professional services fees, principally related to optional services engagements that are not essential
to the functionality of our core SaaS offerings and are considered to have stand-alone value, are
generally recognized on a proportional performance basis based on days of effort. In our consolidated
statements of comprehensive loss, SaaS subscription revenue and optional professional services
revenue are included in perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue and professional services revenue,
respectively. To date, SaaS and related professional services revenues have not represented a
significant percentage of our total revenue in any period.

**_Other Revenue Recognition Considerations_**

In arrangements containing both software and non-software (e.g., SaaS) elements, which to date
have been infrequent, we allocate the arrangement consideration first into software and non-software
units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy and then apply the applicable software
and non-software revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting. To date, we have determined
the relative selling price of software and non-software units of accounting based on management’s
best estimate of selling price as other means of determining relative selling price (e.g., VSOE of the fair
value or other third-party evidence) have not been available with respect to all of the components in
bundled software and non-software arrangements.

We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators
(collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions
with the end users of our products and services. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel
partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return or price protection to any of our
channel partners.

Revenue from financed customer transactions are generally recognized in the same manner as
those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers
and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements
where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments
become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or
a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received.

We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not
included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are invoiced and relieve the
liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency.

In our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, revenue is categorized as perpetual
license, perpetual maintenance and SaaS, term license and maintenance or professional services
revenue. We allocate revenue from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these
categories based on the VSOE of the fair value of the elements in each revenue arrangement and the

F-13


-----

application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of the fair
value of all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of the fair
value of all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which
VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which
VSOE of the fair value has not been established based upon management’s best estimate of fair value
of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee.
Management’s best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of the fair value has
not been established is based upon the VSOE of the fair value of similar offerings and other objective
criteria.

**_Cost of License, Maintenance and SaaS Revenue_**

Cost of license, maintenance and SaaS revenue is primarily comprised of the amortization of
share-based compensation components of capitalized software development costs, license-based
royalties to third parties, production and distribution costs for initial product licenses, costs associated
with the customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance,
enhancement and support services to our customers, as well as internal and third party infrastructure
hosting and support costs associated with our SaaS offerings.

**_Sales Commissions_**

We pay commissions, other incentives and sales bonuses to our direct sales force related to
customer transactions under sales compensation plans established annually. We defer the portion of
commissions that are direct and incremental to customer contracts and recognize them as selling and
marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss over the terms of the
related customer contracts, in proportion to the recognition of the associated revenue. The commission
payments are typically paid in full in the month following execution of the customer contracts. Deferred
commissions at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $91.0 million (of which $45.4 million was included in
other current assets and $45.6 million was included in other long-term assets) and $89.0 million (of
which $42.5 million was included in other current assets and $46.5 million was included in other longterm assets), respectively.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

Share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and is recognized as compensation expense either on a straight-line basis (for time-based
awards) or using the accelerated method (for market-based awards) over the requisite service period
of the award, which is typically the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for when they occur.

Refer to Note 8 for further information regarding share-based compensation.

**_Income Taxes_**

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax
bases, along with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Income taxes include U.S. and
foreign income taxes, including U.S. federal taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to
the extent such earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than
not to be realized.

F-14


-----

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of
being sustained. We utilize a “more likely than not” threshold for the recognition and derecognition of
tax positions and measure positions accordingly. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in
the period in which the change in judgment occurs, which can be caused by the closing of a tax audit,
judicial rulings, expirations of the statute of limitations or refinements of estimates based on changing
facts or circumstances. We recognize interest and penalties in benefit for income taxes in our
consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding income taxes.

**(2) Financial Instruments**

Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash . . . . . . $563.2 $628.8

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

In order to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates on interest payments associated with
our variable-rate U.S. Term Loans and Foreign Euro Term Loans (as defined in Note 5), we entered
into a series of interest rate cap agreements (the Interest Rate Caps), the terms of which are as
follows:

Notional €400.0 million €300.0 million $2,304.0 million $1,728.0 million
Effective Date February 6, 2014 September 5, 2016 February 6, 2014 September 6, 2016
Maturity Date September 3, 2016 September 3, 2018 September 6, 2016 September 4, 2018
Strike Rate 3.00% 5.00% 3.00% 5.00%
Index 3-month 3-month 3-month 3-month
EURIBOR EURIBOR USD-LIBOR-BBA USD-LIBOR-BBA

The Interest Rate Caps have quarterly interest rate reset dates. To the extent the index interest
rate exceeds the strike rate on an interest rate reset date, the counterparty will pay us an amount equal
to the notional amount of the Interest Rate Cap multiplied by the amount by which the index interest
rate exceeds the Interest Rate Cap’s strike rate.

The €400.0 million Euro-denominated Interest Rate Cap was not designated as a hedge for
accounting purposes during the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and matured on September 3,
2016. The $2,304.0 million Interest Rate Cap was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability of
interest payments under the U.S. Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest
rate (LIBOR) and matured on September 6, 2016. The $1,728.0 million Interest Rate Cap was
designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability of interest payments under the U.S. Term Loans due
to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) and was de-designated effective
December 25, 2016. The €300.0 million Euro-denominated Interest Rate Cap is designated as a cash

F-15


-----

flow hedge of the variability of interest payments under the Foreign Euro Term Loans due to changes
in the underlying benchmark interest rate (EURIBOR). The critical terms of those Interest Rate Caps
designated as cash flow hedges closely match those of the hedged portions of the Term Loans and the
derivative instruments were, or are expected to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged
forecasted future interest payments associated with the hedged portions of the underlying debt.

In October 2013, we entered into four cross currency interest rate swap agreements (the Foreign
Cross Currency Swaps) on a total notional amount of $335.0 million. During the year ended March 31,
2018, the Company terminated all the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps in connection with the
repayment of the Foreign USD Term Loans pursuant to Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 4
(both as defined in Note 5) for total proceeds of $44.7 million, representing the fair value of the swaps
on the termination dates. We recognized a net loss of $4.4 million, which is included in other income
(expense), net, during the year ended March 31, 2018, related to the terminations.

The Foreign Cross Currency Swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of
interest payments under the Foreign USD Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark
interest rates (LIBOR) and the variability of the principal balance due to changes in the Euro to U.S.
dollar exchange rate. The critical terms of the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps closely matched those of
the hedged portions of the Foreign USD Term Loans and, until their termination, the derivative
instruments were highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged forecasted future interest
payments as well as foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with the hedged
portions of the Foreign USD Term Loans.

In September 2016, we entered into a cross currency swap (the U.S. Cross Currency Swap) on a
total notional amount of $1.0 billion and a deferred premium currency call option (the USD/EUR
Option) with a U.S. dollar/Euro strike price of approximately 1.35. Under the terms of the U.S. Cross
Currency Swap, we swapped U.S. dollar variable-rate interest payments on $1.0 billion of principal of
the U.S. Term Loans for a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.62% on a fixed Euro notional amount
of €889.4 million (determined based on a Euro spot exchange rate of 1.12). The counterparty pays us
an amount equal to the U.S. dollar notional amount multiplied by the applicable variable interest rate,
and we pay the counterparty a fixed interest payment equal to the Euro notional amount multiplied by
the fixed interest rate. Upon final settlement at maturity of the U.S. Cross Currency Swap, we will pay
the counterparty €444.7 million and will receive $500.0 million from the counterparty. The U.S. Cross
Currency Swap matures on September 10, 2019. Under the terms of the USD/EUR Option, we pay a
quarterly premium at a fixed rate of 0.88% on a fixed Euro notional of €444.7 million. Upon final
settlement at maturity of the USD/EUR Option, we have the option to pay the counterparty
$600.0 million and to receive €444.7 million from the counterparty, limiting our exposure to changes in
Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates related to the final settlement of the U.S. Cross Currency Swap.
The USD/EUR Option also matures on September 10, 2019.

The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated balance
sheets as other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities.

Changes in the fair value of the €300.0 million Euro-denominated Interest Rate Cap, the
$2,304.0 million Interest Rate Cap, the $1,728.0 million Interest Rate Cap (through December 25,
2016) and the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps (through their respective termination dates) are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ deficit. Hedge ineffectiveness
was immaterial for all periods presented. Changes in the fair value of the €400.0 million Eurodenominated Interest Rate Cap, the $1,728.0 million Interest Rate Cap (subsequent to December 25,
2016), the U.S. Cross Currency Swap and the USD/EUR Option are recognized within other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

F-16


-----

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to
our derivative instruments, but we do not expect our counterparty to fail to meet its obligations given its
high credit ratings.

For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded net losses of $14.3 million,
$27.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, in other income (expense), net, related to our foreign
currency exposures, including a loss of $34.7 million, a gain of $20.6 million and a loss of $19.9 million,
respectively, on the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps. For the year ended March 31, 2018, other income
(expense), net, also includes a net loss of $73.7 million related to the U.S. Cross Currency Swap and a
net gain of $4.8 million related to the USD/EUR Option. For the year ended March 31, 2017, other
expense, net, also includes a net gain of $32.5 million related to the U.S. Cross Currency Swap and a
net loss of $8.4 million related to the USD/EUR Option.

For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we reclassified losses of $9.0 million
(pre-tax), $5.6 million (pre-tax) and $3.5 million (pre-tax), respectively, out of accumulated other
comprehensive loss into interest expense, net. As of March 31, 2018, only the €300.0 million Eurodenominated Interest Rate Cap is designated as a cash flow hedge. The Company expects to
reclassify losses of approximately $5.0 million, net, from accumulated other comprehensive loss into
interest expense, net, related to the Company’s Interest Rate Caps in the next twelve months.

**_Trade Finance Receivables_**

A substantial portion of our trade finance receivables is transferred to financial institutions on a
non-recourse basis. We utilize wholly-owned finance subsidiaries in these finance receivables
transfers. These entities are consolidated into our financial position and results of operations. We
account for such transfers as sales in accordance with applicable accounting rules pertaining to the
transfers of financial assets and the sale of future revenue when we have surrendered control of such
receivables (including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the
reach of our creditors) and when we do not have significant continuing involvement in the generation of
cash flows due the financial institutions. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we
transferred $136.2 million, $279.2 million and $250.7 million, respectively, of such receivables through
these programs. Trade finance receivables are typically transferred within several months after
origination and the outstanding principal balance at the time of transfer typically approximates fair
value, resulting in no material gain or loss at the time of sale.

For trade finance receivables that have not been transferred, we evaluate the credit risk of trade
finance receivables in our portfolio based on characteristics specific to the risk climate in each of our
geographic operations as well as based on internal credit quality indicators for individual receivables.
We evaluate the credit risk of trade finance receivables quarterly using an internal credit rating system
based on whether an individual receivable meets specific internal criteria, including counterparty credit
rating and receivable maturity date, and assign an internal credit rating of 1, 2 or 3, with a credit rating
of 1 representing the best credit quality.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable
inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and
reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using
the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and
liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement:

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to
unobservable inputs.

**_Recurring Fair Value Measurements_**

We measure our derivative instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. These derivative
financial instruments were valued using the income approach and were classified as Level 3 financial
instruments. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future estimated cash flows to
a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts. Level 3
classification is applied to assets and liabilities when prices are not derived from existing market data
and requires us to develop our own assumptions about how market participants would value the asset
or liability. The Company’s credit spreads, which ranged from 3.1% to 4.5% and 3.9% to 8.2% for the
years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were significant unobservable inputs used in the
fair value measurement of our derivative instruments.

income approach, which converts estimated cash flows to a single present value based on current
market expectations and includes Level 3 inputs. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes and the
senior contingent cash pay notes due 2019 are estimated using the market approach, which uses
Level 2 inputs, including prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

The carrying values of all other financial instruments, consisting primarily of certificates of deposit
and other borrowings, approximated their respective fair values.

**_Senior Unsecured Notes_**

In August 2013, we issued $1,625.0 million of senior unsecured notes due July 2021, pursuant to
an indenture dated August 21, 2013 (the Indenture) and in December 2017, we issued $150.0 million
of additional senior unsecured notes (the 2021 Notes) under a supplement to the Indenture. The 2021
Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.125% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15
of each year. The obligations under the 2021 Notes are guaranteed by the Company’s domestic
subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as specified
in the Indenture), we must offer to purchase the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

As part of the Acquisition, we assumed three issuances of senior unsecured notes due June
2018, February 2022 and December 2022 at their Acquisition Date fair values. The senior unsecured
notes due June 2018 and December 2022 bear interest at a rate of 7.25% and 4.5% per annum,

-----

respectively (effective interest rates of 7.4% and 6.6%, respectively), payable semi-annually in June
and December of each year. The senior unsecured notes due February 2022 bear interest at a rate of
4.25% per annum (effective interest rate of 6.6%), payable semi-annually in February and August of
each year. These senior unsecured notes are redeemable at our option at any time at the redemption
prices specified in the respective indentures and contain provisions for a put option upon a change of
control, requiring us to offer to purchase the senior notes at 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

In March 2017, we prepaid principal of $100.0 million on the senior unsecured notes due June
2018 for a total payment of $108.7 million, including a premium and accrued interest of $6.6 million and
$2.1 million, respectively. In March 2018, we prepaid the remaining outstanding principal of
$200.0 million on the senior unsecured notes due June 2018 for a total payment of $206.4 million,
including a premium and accrued interest of $1.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

Concurrent with the closing of the Acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended
(the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders which provides for (i) U.S. term loans denominated
in U.S. dollars (the U.S. Term Loans), (ii) foreign term loans denominated in U.S. dollars (the Foreign
USD Term Loans) and (iii) foreign term loans denominated in Euros (the Foreign Euro Term Loans)
(collectively, the Term Loans) totaling approximately $3.9 billion, with a maturity date of September
2020. Concurrent with the consummation of the Acquisition, the full amount of the Term Loans was
drawn. Proceeds from the Term Loans were net of a discount of $38.9 million.

The aggregate original principal amounts of the U.S. Term Loans, the Foreign USD Term Loans
and the Foreign Euro Term Loans were $2,880.0 million, $335.0 million and €500.0 million,
respectively.

The Term Loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount for each interest period at
floating rates, as specified in the Credit Agreement, based on either, at our election, the prime rate, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, subject to a floor (each as defined), plus
applicable spreads as specified in the Credit Agreement, payable in arrears on the last day of each
interest period. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted-average effective interest rate for the Term Loans
was 5.2%, prior to the effect of derivative instruments. As discussed in Note 2, the Interest Rate Caps
minimize the impact of increases in interest rates on interest payments associated with the Term
Loans. These Interest Rate Caps limit our exposure to the Eurocurrency Rate component of interest
rates on the hedged portions of the Term Loans to a maximum rate of 5.00% from September 2016
through September 2018. Additionally, we were party to the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps on a total
notional amount of $285.0 million to swap U.S. dollar variable-rate interest payments on a portion of
the Term Loans for an average fixed interest rate of 5.84% on a fixed Euro notional amount of
€208.5 million prior to their termination during the year ended March 31, 2018. In September 2016, we
entered into the U.S. Cross Currency Swap on a total notional amount of $1.0 billion to swap U.S.
dollar variable-rate interest payments on a portion of the U.S. Term Loans for a fixed interest rate of
approximately 4.62% on a fixed Euro notional amount of €889.4 million, and we entered into the USD/
EUR Option with a U.S. dollar/Euro strike price of approximately 1.35 to swap U.S. dollars for Euros,
limiting our exposure to changes in Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates related to the U.S. Cross
Currency Swap.

In April 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 3) to extend the
maturity date of the Term Loans to September 2022 (accelerated to April 2021 if the aggregate
principal balance of the 2021 Notes is more than $700.0 million on April 15, 2021), which may be
further extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and to refinance the principal

amounts. Amendment No. 3 resulted in outstanding principal amounts under the U.S. Term Loans, the
Foreign USD Term Loans and the Foreign Euro Term Loans of $2,354.1 million, $284.7 million and
€690.0 million, respectively. Amendment No. 3 also reduced the interest rate floor applicable to the
Foreign Euro Term Loans from 1.0% to 0.0%, and reduced the spread for the U.S. Term Loans from
4.0% to 3.75% if the first lien leverage ratio (as defined) is less than or equal to 3.75:1.00.

In December 2017, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 4) to
refinance the principal amounts and adjust the applicable spreads of the Term Loans. Amendment
No. 4 resulted in outstanding principal amounts under the U.S. Term Loans and Foreign Euro Term
Loans of $2,482.3 million and €923.6 million, respectively, and the principal balance of the Foreign
USD Term Loans was fully repaid. Amendment No. 4 also reduced the interest rate spread and the
interest rate floor applicable to the U.S. Term Loans from 3.75% to 3.25% and from 1.0% to 0.0%,
respectively, and reduced the interest rate spread for the Foreign Euro Term Loans from 4.50% to
3.75%.

These Credit Agreement amendments resulted in the repayment of debt with certain lenders in
the syndicate for total repayments of $1,013.6 million, and the Company recognized a loss on
extinguishment of debt of $12.8 million, representing the write-off of unamortized discount and debt
issuance costs associated with the debt extinguishment. These Credit Agreement amendments also
resulted in new borrowings from certain lenders in the syndicate with proceeds totaling
$1,146.3 million, net of a discount of $9.0 million and $17.3 million in debt issuance costs.

The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount,
with the balance payable at maturity.

Subject to certain prepayment premiums and penalties and the payment of customary “breakage”
costs, we may voluntarily prepay the Term Loans at any time. Subject to certain exceptions, the Term
Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to: (i) 100% of the net proceeds (as
determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) from certain non-ordinary course sales or other
dispositions of assets, (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of debt
(other than indebtedness permitted by the Credit Agreement) and (iii) 50% of annual excess cash flow
(as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement with step-downs to 25% and 0% based upon
achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios). The obligations under the Credit Agreement are
guaranteed by the Parent and by certain of the Parent’s domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and are
secured by certain assets of certain of the Parent’s domestic and foreign subsidiaries.

**_Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facilities_**

The Credit Agreement provided for (i) U.S. dollar revolving loans and letters of credit (as defined)
of up to $170.0 million (the U.S. Revolving Loans) and (ii) multicurrency revolving loans and letters of
credit (as defined) of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $180.0 million (the Multicurrency Revolving
Loans) (collectively, the Revolvers), subject to limitations based on a maximum first lien net leverage
ratio (as defined). Under Amendment No. 3, the maturity date of $72.0 million of the U.S. Revolving
Loans and $156.4 million of the Multicurrency Revolving Loans was extended from September 2018 to
September 2020, subject to the nonoccurrence of a springing maturity event (as defined), in which
case the Revolvers will mature on the later of two business days after the springing maturity event or
September 10, 2018, and the remaining $98.0 million of the U.S. Revolving Loans and $23.6 million of
the Multicurrency Revolving Loans continue to mature in September 2018, all of which may be further
extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Under Amendment No. 4, the capacity
available under the U.S. Revolving Loans maturing in September 2018 and September 2020 was
changed from $98.0 million to $57.7 million and from $72.0 million to $79.7 million, respectively, and
the capacity available under the Multicurrency Revolving Loans maturing in September 2018 and

F-24


-----

September 2020 was changed from $23.6 million to $7.4 million and from $156.4 million to
$164.9 million, respectively.

Per the terms of the Credit Agreement, we will pay certain commitment, facility, participation and
fronting fees, as specified in the Credit Agreement.

As of March 31, 2018, and through the date of these financial statements, we have not borrowed
any funds under the Revolvers and, as of March 31, 2018, have approximately $31.7 million in letters
of credit, guarantees and similar instruments outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

**_Debt Covenants_**

In addition to the covenants associated with the PIK Notes discussed below, the above credit
facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things,
limit or restrict the ability of our subsidiary, BSFI, subject to certain exceptions, to: incur additional
indebtedness (including guarantee obligations); incur liens; engage in mergers, consolidations,
liquidations and dissolutions (other than pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement); sell assets; pay dividends to the Parent and make other payments in respect of capital
stock; make acquisitions, investments, loans and advances; pay and modify the terms of certain
indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into negative pledge clauses and
clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and change its line of business. Additionally, the credit
facilities contain customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts; material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty when made; violation of a covenant;
cross-default to material indebtedness; bankruptcy events; material unsatisfied monetary judgments;
actual or asserted invalidity of any loan document and material impairment of the security and/or
guarantees; and a change of control. In addition, under the Revolvers, BSFI will be required to not
exceed a specified first lien net leverage ratio (as defined) in the event that amounts outstanding under
the Revolvers (excluding issued and undrawn letters of credit) exceed 30% of the commitments under
the Revolvers as of the end of any fiscal quarter.

Our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is dependent on, among other things, our
compliance with the above-described financial ratio. Failure to comply with this ratio or the other
provisions of the Credit Agreement (subject to certain grace periods and customary cure rights) could,
absent a waiver or an amendment from the lenders of such agreement, restrict the availability of the
Revolvers and permit the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

**_Senior Contingent Cash Pay Notes_**

In April 2014, the Company issued $750.0 million of PIK Notes pursuant to an indenture dated
April 15, 2014 (the PIK Indenture). Proceeds from the PIK Notes were net of a discount of $3.8 million.
The PIK Notes mature on October 15, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October of
each year and is required to be paid in cash unless certain conditions are met that would allow the
Company to pay all or a portion of interest by increasing the principal amount of the PIK Notes or by
issuing new notes (PIK Interest). Cash interest accrues at 9.000%, and PIK Interest would accrue at
9.750%. All interest payments for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were paid in cash.
The effective interest rate of the PIK Notes is 9.6%

The PIK Notes are redeemable at our option at any time at the redemption prices specified in the
indenture governing the PIK Notes at rates specified in the PIK Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a
change in control (as specified in the PIK Indenture), we must offer to purchase the PIK Notes at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of the purchase.

F-25


-----

The PIK Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial
restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee
indebtedness; pay dividends, make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital
stock; make loans, investments and other restricted payments; sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; or enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’
ability to pay dividends.

A breach of the covenants under the PIK Indenture could result in an event of default. Such a
default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal and/or related interest
payments.

During the year ended March 31, 2017, BSFI purchased $146.1 million of the PIK Notes in the
open market for $124.6 million, including $2.7 million of accrued interest. The PIK Notes were held by
BSFI as permitted investments under the terms of the Credit Agreement and bond indentures. This
was treated as a debt extinguishment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The
Company recognized a net gain on extinguishment of $21.8 million, included in other income
(expense), net.

Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company redeemed $300.0 million of
PIK Notes at par, plus unpaid accrued interest of $5.8 million, and legally extinguished all
$146.1 million principal amount of PIK Notes held by BSFI.

**(6) Deferred Revenue**

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferred perpetual license, perpetual maintenance and SaaS,
term license and maintenance and professional services revenue. Deferred revenue for arrangements
with trade payment terms is generally recorded when the underlying contractual commitment is
invoiceable and deferred revenue for arrangements that are financed is recorded based on the present
value of contractually committed future payments. The components of deferred revenue at March 31,
2018 and 2017 were:

Income tax benefit for the year ended March 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by amounts
recorded to reflect the provisional impacts of U.S. tax law changes commonly referred to as the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act).

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. For
our fiscal 2018 tax year, we utilized a blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 31.5% based on the
weighted average daily tax rate. The Tax Act also contains multiple other provisions impacting us,
including the creation of a territorial-style tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously
deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries (the Transition Tax) as well as other provisions that we
will continue to evaluate in future periods.

Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118) requires that a
company include in its financial statements the reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on
earnings to the extent such reasonable estimates have been determined. SAB 118 permits a
measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has permitted private companies to apply SAB 118, which we have
elected to do. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded the following provisional amounts that
resulted in a net charge of $108.4 million recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018: (i) a
$175.7 million charge related to the Transition Tax, net of Transition Tax-related foreign tax credits;
(ii) a $76.2 million valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that are not expected to be utilized
because of changes to the international tax provisions of the Tax Act; and (iii) an offsetting
$143.5 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. based
on the new lower federal corporate tax rate.

The Company will continue to refine these provisional amounts and final impacts may differ from
these estimates due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions,
completion of our tax calculations through the end of the measurement period permitted under SAB
118 and consideration of additional guidance that may be published by U.S. tax authorities.

The Tax Act also established new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax rules.
Because of the complexity of the GILTI rules, we are in the early stage of evaluating the tax accounting
impacts including whether we will make an accounting policy election to either (i) treat taxes due on
future U.S. GILTI inclusions in taxable income as a current expense when incurred (the period cost
method) or (ii) factor such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the deferred method).
Multiple factors must be evaluated before we can make this determination and fully assess the impacts
of the GILTI rules. Therefore, we have not yet recorded any income tax accounting impacts associated
with this provision of the Tax Act.

The Company expects to finalize the tax accounting impacts of the Tax Act as soon as
practicable, but not later than the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 (quarter ending December 31, 2018).

Net deferred tax liabilities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (63.2) $(207.7)

In evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence,
both positive and negative, including our past operating results, reversals of existing temporary
differences, tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income. In considering these
sources of taxable income, we must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the
plans and estimates used to manage our underlying business. Changes in our assumptions, plans and
estimates may materially impact our income tax benefit.

We maintain a valuation allowance against certain tax credits and net operating and capital loss
carryforwards that we do not believe are more likely than not to be utilized in the future. The valuation
allowance increased (decreased) by $78.7 million, $(66.1) million and $66.4 million during the years
ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These changes to the valuation allowance are
primarily due to changes in estimates of the utilization of foreign tax credits, which for fiscal 2018 was
primarily a result of the Tax Act. At March 31, 2018, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards
of $373.0 million, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $113.3 million, research and development tax
credit carryforwards of $3.9 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $2.3 million, all of
which expire between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2036. Certain of the federal net operating loss carryforward
assets are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected
to be fully realized. The capital loss carryforward is subject to expiration after the five-year limitation
and will expire in fiscal 2021.

For the year ended March 31, 2017, we did not consider any of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings
to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As a result of the Tax Act, we re-evaluated our
assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment and for the year ended March 31, 2018, the temporary
differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 for the impact

F-29


-----

of the change in assertion. Therefore, a deferred tax liability is not recorded for the temporary
difference related to our book and tax basis investment in our foreign subsidiaries. This temporary
difference is primarily related to goodwill that is recorded for GAAP but that has no tax basis and will
become taxable only in an unusual, infrequent impairment event or upon a subsequent sale of the
foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that the deferred tax liability as of March 31, 2018 for this temporary
difference, if recorded, is approximately $97 million.

We carry out our business operations through legal entities in the United States and multiple
foreign jurisdictions. These jurisdictions require that we file corporate income tax returns that are
subject to U.S., state and foreign tax laws. We are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in
these multiple jurisdictions.

Our tax years are closed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) through the tax year
ended March 31, 2012. In June 2015, the favorable decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals related to the
year ended March 31, 2006 became final, and a refund of $18.7 million, which includes both tax and
interest, was received from the IRS during the year ended March 31, 2017. In addition, certain tax
years related to local, state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination. To provide for
potential tax exposures, we maintain a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which we believe is
adequate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective
tax rate is $25.3 million.

On October 11, 2016, the Spanish Supreme Court rendered an unfavorable ruling against the
Company regarding Spanish Non Resident Income Tax derived from payments carried out by Spanish
tax resident customers. As a result, the Company recorded additional tax expense of approximately
$15 million, including related penalties and interest, during the year ended March 31, 2017.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within benefit for income
taxes. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts
accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period in
which such determination is made. We recognized a net benefit of $1.8 million, $1.3 million and
$14.1 million related to interest and penalties during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was
$12.1 million and $14.1 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total amount of tax
accrued related to uncertain tax positions was $26.2 million and $29.5 million at March 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively.

**(8) Share-Based Compensation**

The Company has issued stock options to its executives and other employees which primarily
vest in annual increments over four or five years, with a term of ten years. These grants typically
consist of stock options that are half time-based (the time-vesting options) and half which contain
service, performance and market conditions (the performance-vesting options). The time-vesting
options vest in annual increments assuming continued employment, with accelerated vesting in the
event of a change of control. The performance-vesting options also vest in annual increments,
assuming continued employment, the occurrence of a liquidity event and the achievement of target
investor returns. Additionally, there are provisions for partial vesting for both time-vesting and
performance-vesting options in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances as set
forth in the terms of the award. The options are exercisable for Class B non-voting common stock. Both
the time-vesting options and the performance-vesting options contain certain repurchase features that
allow the Company to repurchase shares acquired by the employee through the exercise of the
options, contingent upon the employee’s separation from the Company, after six months from the date
of exercise.

F-30


-----

Additionally, the Company issues long-term incentive awards with share settlement features to
certain employees (the LTIP Awards). The LTIP Awards consist of both time-based awards, which vest
1/3 per year over three years, and performance-based awards, which vest 1/3 per year over three
years, further adjusted from 0% to 200% of the target payout based on the achievement of certain
financial metrics. The LTIP Awards are settled in cash unless the Company, any affiliate of the
Company or any successor entity to the Company is a publicly-traded company, in which case the
LTIP Awards are settled in stock. The LTIP Awards are accounted for as liability awards.

In April 2014, the Company paid a dividend to its stockholders of $56.1959 per share. In
connection with this dividend, the exercise price of the performance-vesting options outstanding at the
date of the dividend was adjusted to reflect the effects of the dividend. The outstanding time-vesting
options were modified to provide for future cash settlement of a portion of the award representing the
amount by which the exercise price would have been adjusted to reflect the dividend. In connection
with this modification, these time-vesting option holders received rights to future cash payments
totaling approximately $35 million, representing the equivalent of the exercise price adjustment,
payable annually over the original vesting term of the award, with the first payment accelerated to May
2014.

In February 2018, the Company approved the Boxer Parent Company Inc. Stock Option
Exchange Plan (the Exchange Plan), which allows approximately 25 option holders to receive cash
proceeds in exchange for the cancellation of a limited quantity of time-vesting options or performancevesting options. The value received in cash is equal to the intrinsic value of the options cancelled under
the Exchange Plan, based on the Company’s approved stock value on each of four Exchange Dates
(as defined in the Exchange Plan), which are set to 20 days after the January 1 or July 1 stock
valuation has been approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee (i.e., two dates in calendar
2018 and two dates in calendar 2019). A participant must have completed two years of service prior to
the relevant Exchange Date to be eligible, and the aggregate amount of options that a participant may
exchange pursuant to the Exchange Plan generally is limited to a maximum of 30% of a participant’s
options outstanding as of November 1, 2017, and a participant may exchange no more than 10% of
such outstanding options on any one Exchange Date. The Exchange Plan represented a modification
of the options eligible to be exchanged, and these options are accounted for as liability awards as of
the modification date. The modification resulted in incremental share-based compensation expense of
$19.5 million, as of the modification date, for the year ended March 31, 2018. The first Exchange Date
occurred subsequent to March 31, 2018.

During the year ended March 31, 2018, we had stock option activity as follows:

Share-based compensation costs for time-vesting options are based on the fair value calculated

options, are based on the grant-date fair value calculated from the Monte Carlo simulation model. The
grant-date fair values of the time-vesting options are recorded as compensation expense on a straightline basis over the entire vesting period of the awards, with an evaluation done on each vesting date to
true up the expense, if necessary, to at least equal the grant-date fair value of the vested portion of the
award. The performance-vesting options are expensed using the accelerated method over the vesting
period.

The fair values of stock options granted during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016
were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation model with
the following assumptions:

**Year Ended March 31,**
**2018** **2017** **2016**

Expected volatility. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65.0% 73.0% 80.0%

Dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%

We estimate the expected volatility of our common stock using similar public entities’ historical
volatility (as well as BMC’s historical volatility as a public company), adjusted for the Company’s capital
structure, for a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the options. The expected term
of the options granted has been derived using the simplified method, which calculates the expected
term as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term, as the Company
does not have sufficient historical exercise data. We estimate the risk-free interest rate based on yields
of U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity corresponding to the expected term of the options. We
assume a dividend yield of zero, as there is no intent to pay future dividends.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended March 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016 was $116.38, $103.29 and $52.78, respectively.

The activity for the LTIP Awards during the year ended March 31, 2018 was as follows:

**Weighted-**
**Average**

Share-based compensation costs for LTIP Awards are based on the target payout amount and
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The expense associated
with performance-based LTIP Awards is adjusted for the expected achievement of the performance
condition each period. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded sharebased compensation expense of $16.9 million, $8.8 million and $0.0 million, respectively, associated
with the LTIP Awards.

The Company issues Class B common shares from treasury shares upon the exercise of stock
options. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 2.5 million and 2.3 million Class B common shares,

F-32


-----

respectively, available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans. The Company paid
$19.0 million, $17.8 million and $20.1 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, to settle certain share-based awards.

Share-based compensation expense as recorded in our consolidated statements of
comprehensive loss is summarized as follows:

**Year Ended March 31,**
**2018** **2017** **2016**
**(in millions)**
Cost of license, maintenance and SaaS revenue. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 8.6 $ 8.0 $ 6.7

weighted-average period of approximately 2.72 years.

**(9) Gain on Patent Litigation, Net**

We were previously the plaintiff in three patent infringement lawsuits against ServiceNow, Inc.
(ServiceNow), a provider of IT service management software, alleging infringement of multiple patents
issued to us. In April 2016, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement (the Settlement
Agreement) with ServiceNow to resolve the patent infringement litigation. Under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement, ServiceNow agreed to pay us $250 million in settlement of all claims brought
against ServiceNow in these patent infringement suits; the parties each provided a general release
from all past claims, including claims related to infringement of all patents in dispute; and the parties
entered into a covenant not to sue for patent infringement for a term of three years. The one-time
settlement payment was received by us in April 2016 and, after deducting related contingent legal fees
payable to our attorneys, amounted to $215.0 million. The settlement proceeds, net of related
contingent legal fees, are reflected as gain on patent litigation, net in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive loss for the year ended March 31, 2017.

**(10) Retirement Plan**

We sponsor a 401(k) plan that is available to substantially all U.S. employees. The plan provides
for an employer match element with annual per-employee limitations that we have changed and may
change from time to time. The costs of our matching contributions amounted to $13.5 million,
$13.9 million and $14.3 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Employees become 100% vested in the employer match contributions upon reaching two years of
service from date of hire.

**(11) Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Guarantees_**

Under our standard software license agreements, we agree to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless our licensees from and against certain losses, damages and costs arising from claims

F-33


-----

alleging the licensees’ use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Also,
under these standard license agreements, we represent and warrant to licensees that our software
products operate substantially in accordance with published specifications.

Other guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of our executive
officers, non-employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses, damages and
costs incurred by each such individual in administrative, legal or investigative proceedings arising from
alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties
on our behalf.

We also had outstanding letters of credit, guarantees and similar instruments at March 31, 2018
of approximately $54.9 million (including $31.7 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement),
primarily in support of performance obligations to various customers, but also related to facilities and
other obligations.

Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to such indemnifications, warranties
and guarantees. As such, and based on other factors, no provision or accrual for these items has been
made.

**_Lease Commitments_**

We lease office space and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases. Rent
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms and amounted to
$58.4 million, $53.3 million and $68.9 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

We have procured certain equipment under non-cancelable capital lease arrangements. The
current and long-term portions of these capital lease obligations, which are included in accrued
liabilities and long-term borrowings, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, were $6.5 million
and $8.0 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018, and $7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively, at
March 31, 2017.

The following table summarizes future minimum rental payments to be made under
non-cancelable operating leases and minimum sublease payments to be received under
non-cancelable subleases, and capital leases, each with initial or remaining terms in excess of one
year, at March 31, 2018:

**_Contingencies_**

We are party to various labor claims brought by certain former international employees alleging
that amounts are due to such employees for unpaid commissions and other compensation. The claims

F-34


-----

are in various stages and are not expected to be fully resolved in the near future; however, we intend
to vigorously contest all of the claims. Taking into account accruals we have recorded, we believe the
likelihood of a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements resulting from these
claims is remote. However, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of these matters.

We are litigating a matter in Brazilian courts as to whether a tax applies to the remittance of
software payments from our Brazilian operations. In February 2007, a law was enacted that clarified
that this particular tax did not apply to the remittance of software payments, retroactive to January 1,
2006. We continue to pursue a favorable resolution on this matter for years prior to January 1, 2006.
While we believe we will ultimately prevail based on the merits of our position, if we do not, we could
incur a charge of up to approximately $7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates in effect at
March 31, 2018; however, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this matter.

Additionally, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or
unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Taking into account accruals we have
recorded, we believe the likelihood of a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial

ending March 31, 2019. We continue to review the impact of these actions and will determine if, based
on future operating results, additional actions to reduce operating expenses are necessary. The
amount of any potential future charges for such actions will depend upon the nature, timing and extent
of those actions.

**(13) Related Party Transactions**

We entered into an advisory and payment agreement effective September 10, 2013 with certain
of the Sponsors to provide management, consulting and advisory services to the Company. The
agreement has an initial term of ten years and may be terminated by certain of the Sponsors. Under
the terms of the agreement, we are required to make quarterly payments of $2.5 million (subject to
adjustment based on Consolidated EBITDA, as defined), plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses, which are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive loss and totaled $10.4 million, $11.1 million and $10.7 million for the years ended
March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, the agreement requires additional
payments in the event of certain transactions such as a merger, disposition of assets, recapitalization,
refinancing or other transactions as defined in the agreement. If the agreement is terminated in
connection with a change in control or initial public offering, we are required to pay a termination fee
representing the present value of the remaining quarterly payments that would have been payable
through the initial ten year term. No such additional payments have been made under the agreement.

Affiliates of certain of the Sponsors participate as lenders in the Company’s Credit Agreement as
part of loan participations facilitated by the administrative agent with various investors on terms that are
identical across all investors, including any affiliates of the Sponsors.

In May 2018, the Parent entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the May 2018 Merger

The closing of the Merger is subject to several customary conditions, including certain regulatory
approvals. The Parent has also made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the May
2018 Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants (1) to conduct its business in the
ordinary course during the period between the execution of the May 2018 Merger Agreement and the
closing date and (2) not to engage in certain types of transactions during this period unless agreed to
by the Acquiror.

The Acquiror has obtained debt financing commitments for the purpose of financing the
transactions contemplated by the May 2018 Merger Agreement. The obligations of the lenders to
provide debt financing under the debt commitments are subject to a number of customary conditions.

The May 2018 Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Parent and the
Acquiror, including the right of either party to terminate the May 2018 Merger Agreement if the Merger
is not consummated by November 26, 2018, which date will be extended to February 26, 2019 under
certain conditions.

In May 2018, the Company issued a redemption notice to holders of the PIK Notes to redeem the
remaining principal and interest outstanding under the PIK Notes of $309.6 million, which is expected
to be redeemed during the quarter ending June 30, 2018.
