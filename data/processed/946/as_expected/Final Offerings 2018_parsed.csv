946,Final Offerings 2018.md,26,NOTICE TO INVESTORS,26.1,,26.1.1,,"We are furnishing this offering circular on a confidential basis in connection with an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act solely to allow prospective investors to consider the purchase of the Notes. Delivery of this offering circular to any other person or any reproduction of this offering circular, in whole or in part, without our or the initial purchasers’ prior consent is prohibited. The information contained in this offering circular has been provided by us and other sources identified in this offering circular. We accept responsibility for the information contained in this offering circular. We, and not the initial purchasers, have ultimate authority over such information, including its content and whether and how to communicate such information. No representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by the initial purchasers or the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering circular, and nothing contained in this offering circular is, or should be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the initial purchasers or the trustee. The Notes and note guarantees described in this offering circular have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the SEC or any other federal, state or provincial securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such federal, state or provincial securities commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering circular. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange within a reasonable period of time after the issue date of such Notes. The listing application will be subject to approval by the Authority. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on the Issuer making an application for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. The Exchange is not a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Neither the admission of the Euro Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, nor the approval of this offering circular pursuant to the listing requirements of the Authority shall constitute a warranty or representation by the Authority as to the competence of the service providers to, or any other party connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy of information contained in this offering circular or the suitability of the Issuer for investment or any other purposes. Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited is acting as listing agent for the Issuer and for no one else in connection with the listing of the Euro Notes or trading on the Exchange and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Issuer. The Dollar Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the distribution of this offering circular and the offer or sale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” You are not to construe the contents of this offering circular as investment, legal or tax advice. You should consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of the Notes. We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making any representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes by you under appropriate legal investment or similar laws. This offering circular is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) for informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) in offshore transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Its use ii ----- for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering circular may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, nor may it be distributed or any of its contents be disclosed to anyone other than the prospective investors to whom it is being provided. By accepting delivery, you also acknowledge that this document contains confidential information and you agree that the use of this information for any purpose other than considering a purchase of the Notes is strictly prohibited. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as indicated in this offering circular under the caption “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of investing in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.” This offering circular contains summaries, believed to be accurate, of some of the terms of certain documents, but reference is made to the actual documents, copies of which will be made available upon request following their execution and delivery. We do not have any obligation to update or supplement any information contained in this offering circular or otherwise provide similar information in the future. For the complete information contained in those documents, see “Where You Can Find More Information.” In making an investment decision regarding the Notes offered by this offering circular, you must rely on your own examination of our company and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. The offering is being made on the basis of this offering circular. Any decision to purchase Notes in the offering must be based on the information contained in this offering circular. We reserve the right to withdraw the offering of the Notes at any time, and we and the initial purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part, and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of the Notes subscribed for by such investor. We are making this offering subject to the terms described in this offering circular and the indenture related to the Notes. The Dollar Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Dollar Notes sold pursuant to this offering circular will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and registered in its name or in the name of Cede & Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Dollar Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the indenture governing the Dollar Notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form.” The Euro Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Euro Notes sold pursuant to this offering circular will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which will be deposited and held by, or on behalf of, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, or “Euroclear,” and for Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, or “Clearstream.” Beneficial interests in the global certificates relating to the Euro Notes will be shown on, and transfers of such global certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream and their participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Euro Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the indenture that will govern the Euro Notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form.” This offering circular does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes to any person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. For a iii ----- further description of certain restrictions on the offer and sale of the Notes, see “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.” By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” in this offering circular. We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite period of time. By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you acknowledge that (i) you have been afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering circular, (ii) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (iii) this offering circular relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (iv) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering circular, other than as contained in this offering circular and information given by our duly authorized officers and employees in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about August 23, 2018, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding seven (7) business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during the period described above should consult their own advisor. We make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider any information in this offering circular to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an investment in the Notes. You should not assume that the information contained in this offering circular is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering circular. Neither the delivery of the offering circular nor any sale made pursuant to this offering circular implies that any information set forth in this offering circular is correct as of any date after the date of this offering circular. In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes at a higher level than the Notes might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see the section “Plan of Distribution” in this offering circular. iv -----",,as_expected,2018,334,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: We are furnishing this offering circular on a confidential basis in connection with an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act solely to allow prospective investors to consider the purchase of the Notes.

You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite period of time. By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you acknowledge that (i) you have been afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering circular, (ii) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (iii) this offering circular relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (iv) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering circular, other than as contained in this offering circular and information given by our duly authorized officers and employees in connection with an investor\u2019s examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about August 23, 2018, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as \u201cT+10\u201d). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding seven (7) business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during the period described above should consult their own advisor. We make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider any information in this offering circular to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an investment in the Notes. You should not assume that the information contained in this offering circular is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering circular. Neither the delivery of the offering circular nor any sale made pursuant to this offering circular implies that any information set forth in this offering circular is correct as of any date after the date of this offering circular. In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes at a higher level than the Notes might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see the section \u201cPlan of Distribution\u201d in this offering circular. iv -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the related ratio data, as presented in this offering circular, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, operating income, net income (loss) or any performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not intended to be measures of cash flow in accordance with GAAP or a reflection of a comprehensive system of accounting, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments for items that management and the Board of Directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, and for consistency with the manner in which our operating subsidiary, BMC Software Finance Inc., reports its operating results in its periodic reporting to its lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management and the Board of Directors. We also refer to certain bookings information. Bookings represent the total contract value of customer transactions closed and recorded by us during the periods presented. Bookings in a given period are either recognized as revenue in that period or are deferred and recognized as revenue in future periods. Additionally, we evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and constant vi ----- currency basis. Accordingly, we have included certain constant currency metrics that exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by applying constant foreign currency exchange rates to both the current and prior periods. Such exchange rates are primarily USD:EUR of 1.25, USD:GBP of 1.41, INR:USD of 64, BRL:USD of 3.2 and USD:AUD of 0.79. This calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency presentation is not meant to be a substitution for reported amounts presented in conformity with GAAP. For the definitions of, and additional information about, non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, a description of how these non-GAAP financial measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures or to other non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable, see the relevant footnotes under “Summary— Summary Historical Consolidated and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering circular. Our method of calculating non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow on both an as-reported and constant currency basis may vary from the method used by other companies. In addition, in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. Our presentation of non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which adjust for unusual or nonrecurring items, should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We believe many issuers of non-investment grade securities also present these or similar non-GAAP financial measures and the related ratio data because investors, analysts and rating agencies consider them useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations. Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these items in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; (iii) they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; (v) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (vi) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or invest in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results, using these non-GAAP financial measures only for supplemental purposes and by reconciling such non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures or to other non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable. vii ----- The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules require, among other things: ‰ a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; ‰ a quantitative reconciliation for historical non-GAAP measures presented and qualitative differences between non-GAAP financial measures disclosed with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP; ‰ a statement disclosing the purposes for which the issuer’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure; and ‰ a statement disclosing the reasons why the registrant’s management believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding the registrant’s financial condition and results of operations. The rules prohibit, among other things: ‰ exclusion of non-cash charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures; ‰ adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; ‰ presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or notes thereto) or any pro forma financial information; and ‰ pro forma adjustments that are not directly attributable to the specific transactions to which pro forma effect is being given or that are not factually supported or that are not expected to have a continuing impact.

Statements herein regarding the Transactions (as defined herein), future financial and operating results, benefits and synergies of the Transactions, anticipated cost savings, future opportunities and any other statements about future expectations constitute forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may be based on, among other things, available current market and industry material, experts’ reports and opinions, long-term trends and/or management’s expectations, beliefs and projections concerning future events impacting us.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events that depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Industry,9.2.1,,"The ITOM industry is seeing continued growth driven by the challenges facing large enterprises (cost containment, compliance and evolving business demands / need for continuous optimization) and several technology trends. These trends include the growing strategic importance of IT, the increasing complexity of enterprise IT architectures, the increasing challenges enterprises face in managing IT operations and the persistence of mainframe as a core computing platform. Taken together, these trends underpin the technology tailwinds driving the growth of integrated ITOM software platforms. ‰ Market Opportunity. We believe that the global ITOM market represented over $25 billion of spend in 2017 and is expected to grow to over $38 billion of spend in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 7% to 8%. This projected market growth represents an opportunity for us to expand our services and revenues within the ITOM market. For additional information, see “Market, Ranking and Other Industry Data.” ‰ Growing Strategic Importance of IT. The global digitization of business has evolved IT from a supporting function to a core capability for many of today’s leading enterprises. How well a business can build, deliver and manage IT drives its ability to offer differentiated services and compete effectively in the global and online business environment. This evolution has elevated the strategic importance of IT resources in many enterprises and increased the scope of the digital services such enterprises are expected to deliver and manage. ‰ Increasing Complexity of Enterprise IT Architectures. From mainframe to client-server architecture to mobile and multi-cloud to Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices, the evolution of new technologies over the past several decades has expanded the scope of IT. These new technologies often are being deployed alongside existing infrastructure, necessitating the inclusion of operations management in almost all IT disciplines to run a secure and performing business. The compounding complexity of modern IT architectures — coupled with the proliferation of data and increasing transaction volumes — strains IT resources and requires new solutions that enable businesses to manage their IT infrastructures securely and efficiently. 3 ----- ‰ Enterprises **_Face_** **_Increasing_** **_Challenges_** **_in_** **_Managing_** **_IT_** **_Operations._** Modern IT organizations often need to manage disparate types of computing architectures and deployment models including multi-cloud, hybrid and on-premises. They also must maintain performance and availability of technology infrastructure to run mission-critical workloads and dynamically scale IT services to growing business demands. The resulting heterogeneity of modern IT environments has made managing IT operations a complex task for IT professionals. Key challenges include: - managing increasing complexity of business services running across heterogeneous, multi-cloud infrastructure; - securing the IT infrastructure by tracking compliance to identify, prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities; - containing the total cost of ownership of IT infrastructure; - identifying, locating and monitoring all IT assets within complex, multi-cloud environments; - enabling agile software development and IT operations so that organizations can build, deploy and scale applications at faster speeds; and - increasing efficiency, including limiting downtime, accelerating speed of delivering new services and providing faster incident resolution. ‰ Persistence of Mainframe as a Core Computing Platform. Mainframes are powerful servers, capable of processing large numbers of transactions simultaneously, while supporting thousands of applications, users and devices and operating with near perfect uptime. Superior speed, security and reliability constitute the core value proposition of the mainframe and differentiate the platform from other IT infrastructures such as distributed networks or cloud. Transaction processing, data retrieval and records management are among the most missioncritical mainframe workloads. For many of the world’s largest companies, the mainframe is and will continue to be a critical part of their IT infrastructure. Data-sensitive industries such as financial services and governments require the mainframe’s superior security features, and large companies with very high transaction volumes, such as commercial banks, retailers and airlines, rely on the speed and reliability of the mainframe. The central role mainframe servers play in modern IT infrastructure, the risk involved in moving mission critical workloads off the mainframe and the lack of viable alternatives for key use cases create significant barriers to migrating from the platform. Secular trends such as the growth of mobile transactions, proliferation of digital data and increased connectivity between IT infrastructure and endpoints are creating growth in mainframe usage. Organizations are expanding their mainframe computing capacity, measured in millions of instructions per second (“MIPS”) to effectively manage these additional demands. The global installed base of MIPS has more than doubled over the last 10 years. A third-party survey found that the majority of mainframe users expect mainframe spend to increase annually over the next five years. 4 ----- 5 ----- configuration of servers, compliance monitoring, performance reporting and execution of patches running across multiple locations, platforms and applications.

This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes into the applicable Escrow Account. The release of escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, and upon the occurrence of certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance 15 ----- with the procedures set forth herein. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and its affiliates will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the special mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” We will repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities and discharge or defease the Existing Notes on the date we consummate the Merger. See “Use of Proceeds.” The consummation of the Merger and related transactions, the repayment of the Existing Credit Facilities, the discharge or defeasance of the Existing Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the Financing Transactions are referred to collectively in this offering circular as the “Transactions.” For a more detailed description of the Transactions, see “The Transactions.” For a more detailed description of the Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness,” and for a more detailed description of the Notes offered hereby, see “Description of Notes.” 16 ----- 17 ----- closing date to fund the Merger. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $400 million from time to time and includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit. The Credit Facilities will permit us to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility an amount up to $50 million to finance the Merger plus additional amounts to fund original issue discount (“OID”) or upfront fees. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” We do not currently intend to draw any of the $50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so as a result of a decline in cash on the balance sheet on or after the closing date, to fund additional fees or expenses or for other reasons. Euro proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility will be swapped for U.S. dollars on the closing date of the Merger, pursuant to certain foreign currency forward contracts. (2) Represents the U.S. dollar equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, consisting of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes, excluding any discounts and commissions.

The actual purchase price of the Company’s equity will depend on the adjustments to the Merger consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. See “The Transactions—The Merger.” In connection with the Transactions, we intend to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain stock repurchase promissory notes. As of March 31, 2018, we had the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3,603 million aggregate principal amount in outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities, approximately $1,840 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes outstanding and approximately $7 million of stock repurchase promissory notes outstanding. In connection with our repayment of outstanding indebtedness, we intend to pay a premium for the redemption of and accrued interest on the Existing Notes and such stock repurchase promissory notes, which totals approximately $89 million as of March 31, 2018. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Transactions, the borrowings and accrued interest associated with the existing indebtedness may vary. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes are lenders and/or agents under the Existing Credit Facilities and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering through the repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities if such funds are released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger.

The Credit Facilities will permit us to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility an amount up to $50 million to finance the Merger plus additional amounts to fund original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d) or upfront fees. See \u201cDescription of Certain Other Indebtedness.\u201d We do not currently intend to draw any of the $50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at the closing of the Transactions, but may do so as a result of a decline in cash on the balance sheet on or after the closing date, to fund additional fees or expenses or for other reasons. Euro proceeds of the Euro Term Loan Facility will be swapped for U.S. dollars on the closing date of the Merger, pursuant to certain foreign currency forward contracts.

The actual purchase price of the Company\u2019s equity will depend on the adjustments to the Merger consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. See \u201cThe Transactions\u2014The Merger.\u201d In connection with the Transactions, we intend to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain stock repurchase promissory notes. As of March 31, 2018, we had the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3,603 million aggregate principal amount in outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities, approximately $1,840 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes outstanding and approximately $7 million of stock repurchase promissory notes outstanding. In connection with our repayment of outstanding indebtedness, we intend to pay a premium for the redemption of and accrued interest on the Existing Notes and such stock repurchase promissory notes, which totals approximately $89 million as of March 31, 2018. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Transactions, the borrowings and accrued interest associated with the existing indebtedness may vary. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes are lenders and/or agents under the Existing Credit Facilities and, accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering through the repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities if such funds are released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger. See \u201cPlan of Distribution.\u201d As of March 31, 2018, we also had the following indebtedness outstanding: (i) $304 million aggregate principal amount of 9.000% / 9.750% senior contingent cash pay notes due October 14, 2019 (the \u201cExisting PIK Notes\u201d), which were fully redeemed during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and (ii) derivative instruments, (x) certain of which were terminated during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and (y) the remainder of which will mature prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, such indebtedness will not be repaid in connection 18 ----- with the Transactions, but will impact our cash and cash equivalents on a pro forma basis.

As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $3,778.1 million, or 35.8%, of our consolidated total assets, and approximately $1,125.1 million, or 13.6%, of our consolidated total liabilities. To the extent lenders under our new Credit Facilities release any guarantor from its obligations, such guarantor will also be automatically released from its obligations under its note guarantees. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Guarantees.\u201d Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Notes will be solely obligations of Merger Sub and will not be guaranteed and will not otherwise be the beneficiary of any credit support from the Company or any of its subsidiaries. .From and after the consummation of the Merger, the Notes and the note guarantees will be our and the guarantors\u2019 senior unsecured obligations and will: \u2030 rank senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors\u2019 existing and future subordinated indebtedness; \u2030 rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors; \u2030 be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and 23 ----- \u2030 be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness, preferred stock and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer. As of March 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under \u201cUse of Proceeds,\u201d the Issuer and the guarantors collectively would have had $4,394.1 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, and $400.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding $31.7 million of outstanding letters of credit), all of which would have ranked effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby. We also can incur additional secured indebtedness if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes offered hereby. Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . . This offering will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Merger Sub will execute and deliver an Escrow Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, for the benefit of the holders of each series of Notes, the gross proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes into the applicable Escrow Account. The Issuer will grant to the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the holders of the Notes, a firstpriority security interest in the applicable Escrow Account for the Notes and all amounts on deposit therein to secure the obligations under the Notes pending disbursement from such Escrow Account as further described under the heading \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.\u201d \u201dThe release of escrow proceeds to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Merger on the same day as the release of such escrowed funds. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, and upon the occurrence of certain other events, the escrow proceeds of each series of Notes will not be released to Merger Sub to consummate the Merger but instead will be released to the trustee under the indenture for the purpose of redeeming each series of Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Additional cash in respect of 24 ----- interest that would accrue on each series of Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the applicable Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes but KKR and its affiliates will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering to, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, fund the difference between the amounts in each Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the special mandatory redemption price. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.\u201d Optional Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We may redeem some or all of each series of Notes at any time prior to September 1, 2021 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a \u201cmakewhole premium,\u201d as described under \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014 Optional Redemption.\u201d At any time on or after September 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of each series of Notes at the applicable redemption prices described under \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Optional Redemption,\u201d plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Additionally, from time to time prior to September 1, 2021, we may redeem up to 40% of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes at a redemption price equal to 109.750% of the principal amount thereof and (y) the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes at a redemption price equal to 108.375% of the principal amount thereof, in each case, (i) with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds that we raise in one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. The Notes of either series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part before the Notes of the other series are optionally redeemed in full (or at all). Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes or the Guarantors with respect to the Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is required by law with respect to a payment to holders of the Euro Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received after the withholding or deductions is not less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of such withholding or deductions. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts on the Euro Notes.\u201d 25 ----- Tax Redemption. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event the Issuer becomes obligated to pay certain additional amounts with respect to the Euro Notes as a result of certain changes in tax laws, it may redeem the Euro Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of such redemption. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Redemption of Euro Notes for Tax Reasons.\u201d Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . . If a Change of Control (as defined in \u201cDescription of Notes\u201d) occurs, we must offer to repurchase the Notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014 Repurchase at the Option of Holders\u2014Change of Control,\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness\u2014We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.\u201d Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture that will govern the Notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: \u2030 incur additional indebtedness; \u2030 pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; \u2030 prepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness; \u2030 create certain liens; \u2030 sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets; \u2030 make certain investments; \u2030 create dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; \u2030 engage in transactions with affiliates; \u2030 create unrestricted subsidiaries; and \u2030 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as described under \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014 Certain Covenants.\u201d In addition, many of these covenants will cease to apply with respect to a series of the Notes during any time that such series of Notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Fitch Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d) and no default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing. See \u201cDescription of Notes\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Effectiveness of Covenants.\u201d 26 ----- Transfer Restrictions; No Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the note guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, and we are under no obligation to so register the Notes. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, except that holders will not be permitted to transfer the Notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the applicable holding period has been satisfied. See \u201cTransfer Restrictions.\u201d We do not intend to issue registered Notes and note guarantees in exchange for the Notes and the note guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the Notes. See \u201cNotice to Investors\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to the Notes and our Indebtedness\u2014We do not intend to offer to register the Notes or to exchange the Notes in a registered exchange offer.\u201d Use of Proceeds. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the contribution to us by Parent of the net proceeds of Parent\u2019s offering of PIK Preferred Equity, together with borrowings under our Credit Facilities, the Sponsor Equity Contribution and cash on hand to fund the Merger consideration, to retire certain existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related fees and expenses. See \u201cUse of Proceeds.\u201d No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Each series of Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market. Although certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in each series of Notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or, if such a market develops, that it will be maintained. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness\u2014Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading market for the Notes may not develop.\u201d Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange within a reasonable period of time following the issue date of such Notes. The Exchange is not a regulated market for purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. The listing application will be subject to approval by the Authority. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on our making an application 27 ----- for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. We do not intend to list the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness\u2014The Euro Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, and the Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes in certain circumstances.\u201d Denominations Dollar Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,2154,SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA,2154.1,,2154.1.1,,"The following tables set forth our summary historical consolidated and pro forma condensed consolidated financial and operational data for the periods and as of the dates indicated. The summary historical consolidated and pro forma condensed consolidated financial data presented below for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2018, and as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular. The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2016 has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included in this offering circular. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015 has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial information not included in this offering circular. Such 2015 financial information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. Our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular do not reflect the impact of the Transactions. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended March 31, 2018 have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2017 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2018. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Transactions. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above or to project the results for any future date or period. The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma adjustments reflected in our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular (and from which the summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data set forth in the tables below have been derived) reflect adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and are based upon, among other things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair market value may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and stockholders’ equity, revenue, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items of income and expense. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our actual assets and liabilities on the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data do not reflect any non-recurring charges or gains that we may record in connection with the Merger. However, these estimated non-recurring items will be reflected in our statement of operations for the period during which the Merger will take place. 29 ----- 30 ----- 31 ----- 32 ----- 33 ----- 2016, 2017 and 2018, increased perpetual license revenue by $47.8 million, $22.1 million, $9.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively; perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue by $165.8 million, $72.8 million, $27.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively; term license and maintenance revenue by $216.7 million, $137.4 million, $86.3 million and $44.2 million, respectively; professional services revenue by $7.6 million, $1.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively; and total revenue by $437.9 million, $233.5 million, $124.4 million and $66.6 million, respectively. The pro forma amounts for the year ended March 31, 2018 also exclude the effects of estimated purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the Merger, which further increase pro forma perpetual license revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $98.7 million, pro forma perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $422.2 million, pro forma term license and maintenance revenue by $323.7 million and pro forma professional services revenue by $17.7 million. Such pro forma adjustments for purchase accounting are estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, the actual adjustments may differ from the estimated pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. For additional information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” We also present Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) other expense (net), (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items (including the removal of certain purchase accounting adjustments) that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP EBITDA to add back interest income on financed receivables, non-income tax expense and, for the fiscal years 2016 and prior, to normalize the effects of capitalized software development costs to a constant capitalization of $28.9 million per year. Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to actioned cost savings, as described in the footnotes below. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our core operating results when assessing the performance of the Company. In addition, we use Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA because the Existing Credit Facilities and existing indentures governing our Existing Notes use measures, and the new Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes will use measures, similar to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net income (loss). In addition, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA reflects 34 ----- 35 ----- 36 ----- Company’s adoption of new accounting standards, professional fees associated with a potential transaction and non-cash adjustments to estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition. (d) Represents amounts paid to the affiliates of Bain Capital Private Equity, LP, Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc., Insight Venture Management, LLC and a company affiliated with GIC (Ventures) Pte. Ltd. (the “Existing Sponsors”) pursuant to the terms of an advisory and payment agreement (the “Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement”) that will be terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger. Accordingly, following the termination fee payable in connection with the Merger, no additional sponsor management fee will be payable under the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. However, we will be required to pay certain sponsor management fees to KKR in the future, which may be greater than the sponsor management fees pursuant to the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. For additional information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” (e) Represents third-party legal fees and other costs incurred to protect the Company’s intellectual property. (f) Represents proceeds received as a result of the confidential settlement agreement entered into during the year ended March 31, 2017 with ServiceNow, Inc. to resolve the patent infringement litigation, net of contingent third-party legal fees incurred. (g) Represents legal, settlement and related costs associated with specific matters that the Company does not consider part of its core operations or operating results. (h) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the 2013 Acquisition. This adjustment related to deferred costs and other expenses for fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 excludes $91.3 million, $61.6 million, $30.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of non-GAAP amortization expense related to the pre-2013 Acquisition capitalization of software development costs for internally developed products that would have been recognized in these periods, which has no impact on EBITDA. (i) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the Merger. (j) Represents excluded operating expense associated with certain executive severance costs. (k) Represents an adjustment to normalize the impact of capitalized software development costs in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 to a constant capitalization amount of $28.9 million annually. (l) Represents adjustment to apply constant foreign currency exchange rates to current and prior periods. (m) Represents estimated cost savings anticipated to be achieved during the fiscal year 2019 from reductions in headcount and employee-related costs that have already been implemented or initiated on or before May 2018 and which had been planned independent of the Merger, and include estimated cost savings of approximately (i) $3.0 million associated with the continued reduction in costs in non-strategic products; (ii) $9.0 million related to reduced investment in mature products, improved span of control and continued transition to lower-cost development locations; (iii) $20.0 million associated with ESO, including reductions in both support functions spend and direct investment in underperforming geographies, as well as improvement in span of control; (iv) $3.0 million in ESO customer success organization and actions within smaller ESO organizations; (v) $1.0 million related to moving more headcount to lower-cost offshore locations; (vi) $4.0 million related to transitioning North America and Latin America headcount to lower-cost locations; and (vii) $5.0 million related to the reduction in G&A headcount primarily within human resources and IT, with some IT headcount moving to India. We have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $17 million through March 31, 2018, and expect to incur approximately $6 million in additional costs in fiscal year 2019, to achieve these cost savings. None of these $23 million in restructuring costs are netted from our actioned cost savings adjustment or otherwise have reduced our Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein. The calculation of estimated benefits from these cost savings initiatives is an estimation of benefits expected to be achieved in the future and based on assumptions and estimates regarding our future results and therefore is necessarily speculative. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attain these costs savings. Also, the pro forma adjustment to reflect these cost savings may not be permitted in an SEC filing because it is not permitted by Article 11 of Regulation S-X or otherwise. Additionally, we may be unable to realize all of these costs savings within the timeframe expected, or at all, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them. See “Risk Factors—We may not achieve all of the expected cost savings included in Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.” (6) The ratio of Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest expense is determined by dividing Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA by pro forma interest expense. In calculating interest expense for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering 37 ----- circular, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest rates that would apply to each series of Notes and the Credit Facilities and other obligations we will incur at the closing of the Merger. These adjustments are set forth in “Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.” The actual interest rates on the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions may differ materially. Actual interest expense may be higher than pro forma interest expense shown in this offering circular. (7) The ratio of pro forma total net secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing pro forma total net secured debt of $3,818.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $869.4 million. Our pro forma total net secured debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million, the Euro Term Loan Facility of €930.0 million and $17.2 million of other secured debt. Pro forma total net secured debt is defined as pro forma total secured debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to “Capitalization,” we anticipate that our actual cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected in “Capitalization” on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million, not the amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018. If we calculated our pro forma total net secured debt as our pro forma total secured debt less such estimated $62.0 million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in “Capitalization,” our pro forma total net secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 5.0x. (8) The ratio of pro forma total net debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing pro forma total net debt of $5,643.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $869.4 million. Our pro forma total net debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million, Euro Term Loan Facility of €930.0 million, $1,825.0 million equivalent of the Notes offered hereby and $17.2 million of other debt. Pro forma total net debt is defined as pro forma total debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to “Capitalization,” we anticipate that our actual cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected in “Capitalization” on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million, not the amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018. If we calculated our pro forma total net debt as our pro forma total debt less such estimated $62.0 million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in “Capitalization,” our pro forma total net debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 7.1x. (9) We define Free Cash Flow as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted for the items included below, which is also derivable from cash flows from operating activities, less cash paid for purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software development costs, as well as the proceeds from patent litigation settlement, plus payments for interest, income taxes, share-based awards, certain merger-related costs, hurricane relief contributions and sponsor management fees. See below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow. We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our liquidity across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our core operating cash flow results when assessing the performance of the Company. 38 ----- 39 -----",,as_expected,2018,334,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The following tables set forth our summary historical consolidated and pro forma condensed consolidated financial and operational data for the periods and as of the dates indicated.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended March 31, 2018 have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2017 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data have been derived from our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular and give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2018. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our net assets on the closing date of the Transactions. In addition, this pro forma presentation does not contemplate changes in tax structure, accounting policies or synergy benefits. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above or to project the results for any future date or period. The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma adjustments reflected in our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular (and from which the summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data set forth in the tables below have been derived) reflect adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and are based upon, among other things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair market value may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity, revenue, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items of income and expense. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and our actual assets and liabilities on the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data do not reflect any non-recurring charges or gains that we may record in connection with the Merger. However, these estimated non-recurring items will be reflected in our statement of operations for the period during which the Merger will take place. 29 ----- 30 ----- 31 ----- 32 ----- 33 ----- 2016, 2017 and 2018, increased perpetual license revenue by $47.8 million, $22.1 million, $9.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively; perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue by $165.8 million, $72.8 million, $27.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively; term license and maintenance revenue by $216.7 million, $137.4 million, $86.3 million and $44.2 million, respectively; professional services revenue by $7.6 million, $1.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively; and total revenue by $437.9 million, $233.5 million, $124.4 million and $66.6 million, respectively. The pro forma amounts for the year ended March 31, 2018 also exclude the effects of estimated purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the Merger, which further increase pro forma perpetual license revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $98.7 million, pro forma perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue for fiscal year 2018 by $422.2 million, pro forma term license and maintenance revenue by $323.7 million and pro forma professional services revenue by $17.7 million. Such pro forma adjustments for purchase accounting are estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, the actual adjustments may differ from the estimated pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. For additional information, see \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.\u201d We also present Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) other expense (net), (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items (including the removal of certain purchase accounting adjustments) that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP EBITDA to add back interest income on financed receivables, non-income tax expense and, for the fiscal years 2016 and prior, to normalize the effects of capitalized software development costs to a constant capitalization of $28.9 million per year. Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to actioned cost savings, as described in the footnotes below. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our core operating results when assessing the performance of the Company. In addition, we use Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA because the Existing Credit Facilities and existing indentures governing our Existing Notes use measures, and the new Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes will use measures, similar to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net income (loss). In addition, Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA reflects 34 ----- 35 ----- 36 ----- Company\u2019s adoption of new accounting standards, professional fees associated with a potential transaction and non-cash adjustments to estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition. (d) Represents amounts paid to the affiliates of Bain Capital Private Equity, LP, Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc., Insight Venture Management, LLC and a company affiliated with GIC (Ventures) Pte. Ltd. (the \u201cExisting Sponsors\u201d) pursuant to the terms of an advisory and payment agreement (the \u201cExisting Sponsor Advisory Agreement\u201d) that will be terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger. Accordingly, following the termination fee payable in connection with the Merger, no additional sponsor management fee will be payable under the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. However, we will be required to pay certain sponsor management fees to KKR in the future, which may be greater than the sponsor management fees pursuant to the Existing Sponsor Advisory Agreement. For additional information, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d (e) Represents third-party legal fees and other costs incurred to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property. (f) Represents proceeds received as a result of the confidential settlement agreement entered into during the year ended March 31, 2017 with ServiceNow, Inc. to resolve the patent infringement litigation, net of contingent third-party legal fees incurred. (g) Represents legal, settlement and related costs associated with specific matters that the Company does not consider part of its core operations or operating results. (h) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the 2013 Acquisition. This adjustment related to deferred costs and other expenses for fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 excludes $91.3 million, $61.6 million, $30.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of non-GAAP amortization expense related to the pre-2013 Acquisition capitalization of software development costs for internally developed products that would have been recognized in these periods, which has no impact on EBITDA. (i) Represents the net revenues and certain operating expenses (primarily representing the expense associated with deferred commissions and royalties) that would have been recognized had the Company not recorded adjustments to fair value in connection with the purchase accounting for the Merger. (j) Represents excluded operating expense associated with certain executive severance costs. (k) Represents an adjustment to normalize the impact of capitalized software development costs in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 to a constant capitalization amount of $28.9 million annually. (l) Represents adjustment to apply constant foreign currency exchange rates to current and prior periods. (m) Represents estimated cost savings anticipated to be achieved during the fiscal year 2019 from reductions in headcount and employee-related costs that have already been implemented or initiated on or before May 2018 and which had been planned independent of the Merger, and include estimated cost savings of approximately (i) $3.0 million associated with the continued reduction in costs in non-strategic products; (ii) $9.0 million related to reduced investment in mature products, improved span of control and continued transition to lower-cost development locations; (iii) $20.0 million associated with ESO, including reductions in both support functions spend and direct investment in underperforming geographies, as well as improvement in span of control; (iv) $3.0 million in ESO customer success organization and actions within smaller ESO organizations; (v) $1.0 million related to moving more headcount to lower-cost offshore locations; (vi) $4.0 million related to transitioning North America and Latin America headcount to lower-cost locations; and (vii) $5.0 million related to the reduction in G&A headcount primarily within human resources and IT, with some IT headcount moving to India. We have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $17 million through March 31, 2018, and expect to incur approximately $6 million in additional costs in fiscal year 2019, to achieve these cost savings. None of these $23 million in restructuring costs are netted from our actioned cost savings adjustment or otherwise have reduced our Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein. The calculation of estimated benefits from these cost savings initiatives is an estimation of benefits expected to be achieved in the future and based on assumptions and estimates regarding our future results and therefore is necessarily speculative. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attain these costs savings. Also, the pro forma adjustment to reflect these cost savings may not be permitted in an SEC filing because it is not permitted by Article 11 of Regulation S-X or otherwise. Additionally, we may be unable to realize all of these costs savings within the timeframe expected, or at all, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014We may not achieve all of the expected cost savings included in Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d (6) The ratio of Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest expense is determined by dividing Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA by pro forma interest expense. In calculating interest expense for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering 37 ----- circular, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest rates that would apply to each series of Notes and the Credit Facilities and other obligations we will incur at the closing of the Merger. These adjustments are set forth in \u201cUnaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.\u201d The actual interest rates on the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions may differ materially. Actual interest expense may be higher than pro forma interest expense shown in this offering circular. (7) The ratio of pro forma total net secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing pro forma total net secured debt of $3,818.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $869.4 million. Our pro forma total net secured debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million, the Euro Term Loan Facility of \u20ac930.0 million and $17.2 million of other secured debt. Pro forma total net secured debt is defined as pro forma total secured debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to \u201cCapitalization,\u201d we anticipate that our actual cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected in \u201cCapitalization\u201d on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million, not the amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018. If we calculated our pro forma total net secured debt as our pro forma total secured debt less such estimated $62.0 million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in \u201cCapitalization,\u201d our pro forma total net secured debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 5.0x. (8) The ratio of pro forma total net debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is determined by dividing pro forma total net debt of $5,643.9 million by Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $869.4 million. Our pro forma total net debt includes the USD Term Loan Facility of $3,300.0 million, Euro Term Loan Facility of \u20ac930.0 million, $1,825.0 million equivalent of the Notes offered hereby and $17.2 million of other debt. Pro forma total net debt is defined as pro forma total debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. As discussed in footnote (1) to \u201cCapitalization,\u201d we anticipate that our actual cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of the closing of the Merger will be substantially lower than the amount reflected in \u201cCapitalization\u201d on a pro forma basis and is currently estimated to be approximately $62.0 million, not the amount reflected as pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018. If we calculated our pro forma total net debt as our pro forma total debt less such estimated $62.0 million and not $575.2 million as shown on a pro forma basis in \u201cCapitalization,\u201d our pro forma total net debt to Pro Forma Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 7.1x. (9) We define Free Cash Flow as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted for the items included below, which is also derivable from cash flows from operating activities, less cash paid for purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software development costs, as well as the proceeds from patent litigation settlement, plus payments for interest, income taxes, share-based awards, certain merger-related costs, hurricane relief contributions and sponsor management fees. See below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow. We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our liquidity across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management and the Board of Directors do not believe are indicative of our core operating cash flow results when assessing the performance of the Company. 38 ----- 39 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

We include in this category our SaaS offerings. Our SaaS offerings provide our customers with existing and new software management through a hosted service as opposed to traditional software deployments. There can be no assurance that SaaS revenue will be significant in the future despite our levels of investment. There is a risk that our SaaS offerings may reduce demand for licenses and maintenance of our traditional software products, which could impact our revenue. Additionally, margins associated with our SaaS offerings are generally lower than margins associated with our on-premises solutions. A large portion of our revenue is generated from the renewal of existing customer contracts, the rate of which is uncertain and may decline or fluctuate in the future. Our SaaS contracts typically contain non-cancelable subscription terms of one to several years, after which the contracts are generally renewable at a customer’s option, and there are generally no obligations to license additional software or subscribe for additional services. This inherent uncertainty surrounding the renewal of our customer contracts, and the date of any such renewals, impacts when the combination of revenue and changes in deferred 40 ----- revenue in a given period are recorded and creates volatility in our quarterly results. Our customers may not renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription agreements and in fact, some customers elect not to do so. In addition, our customers may opt for a lower-priced edition of our offerings or for fewer subscriptions. We have limited data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, in particular for our newer offerings, so we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If we experience a decline in the renewal rates for our customers or they opt for lower-priced editions of our offerings or fewer subscriptions, our operating results may be adversely impacted. There is also a risk that our internal development and customer support teams could find it difficult or costly to support both traditional software installed by customers and SaaS. To the extent that our new SaaS offerings are defective or there are disruptions to our services, demand for our SaaS offerings could diminish and we could be subject to substantial liability. In addition, interruptions or delays in service from our third-party service delivery hosting vendors could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. Further, if we or our third-party service delivery hosting vendors experience security breaches and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our success in the emerging area of cloud computing depends on organizations and customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with the increasing adoption of virtual infrastructure solutions for on-premises data centers as well as for cloud computing and end-user computing. Concerns about security, privacy, availability, data integrity, retention and ownership may negatively impact the rate of adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing environments are complex and the deployment of our systems management solutions in the cloud may require additional professional services and implementation services which we may not have the ability to provide at an appropriate margin. In the cloud, our products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, all of which must interoperate for end users to achieve their computing goals. As the cloud computing market continues to develop, we expect other companies to enter this market and to introduce their own initiatives that may compete with, or not be compatible with, our cloud solutions.

In order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products and strategies. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable, especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our products. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well-established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits and cost savings of our mergers and acquisitions activities.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Many countries in Europe and Israel, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. We carry out our business operations through entities in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. As such, we are required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S. federal, state and foreign tax laws. Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax liabilities are determined, in part, by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates as well as by the positioning of our cash balances globally. Similarly, if statutory tax rates or tax bases were to increase or if changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were made that impact us directly, our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. This evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income. If management’s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets changes, we will be required to increase our valuation allowance, which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and earnings. We are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense and operating cash outflows. Further, the U.S. federal income tax legislation recently enacted as Public Law No. 115-97 (the “Tax Act”) is highly complex, subject to interpretation, and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, substantial revisions to the taxation of international operations and limitations on the use of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Act.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Many countries in Europe and Israel, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. We carry out our business operations through entities in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. As such, we are required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S. federal, state and foreign tax laws. Our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax liabilities are determined, in part, by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates as well as by the positioning of our cash balances globally. Similarly, if statutory tax rates or tax bases were to increase or if changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were made that impact us directly, our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. This evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income. If management\u2019s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets changes, we will be required to increase our valuation allowance, which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and earnings. We are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense and operating cash outflows. Further, the U.S. federal income tax legislation recently enacted as Public Law No. 115-97 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) is highly complex, subject to interpretation, and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, substantial revisions to the taxation of international operations and limitations on the use of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Act. In the future, the Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) are expected to release regulations and interpretive guidance relating to the legislation contained in the Tax Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect our business. 50 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

International non-GAAP revenue has historically represented approximately 50% of our total non-GAAP revenue and also represented approximately 50% of our total non-GAAP revenue in fiscal year 2018. Success in selling and developing our products throughout the world depends on a variety of factors, risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including: ‰ developing and executing an effective go-to-market strategy in various locations; ‰ difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including compliance with local labor and employment laws and regulations; ‰ non-compliance with our code of conduct or other corporate policies; ‰ longer payment cycles; ‰ increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; ‰ adverse tax consequences; ‰ adverse impact of inflation; ‰ changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 54 ----- ‰ restrictive local laws regarding the transfer of funds from, or the conversion of currencies in, certain countries; ‰ restrictions on our ability to access cash in foreign jurisdictions; ‰ changes in global, economic and political landscapes; ‰ impact from volatile or sluggish local economies or global macroeconomic conditions; ‰ loss of proprietary information, including intellectual property, due to piracy, misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection; ‰ the need to successfully localize our products; ‰ lack of appropriate local infrastructure to carry out operations; ‰ workforce reorganizations in various locations, including global reorganizations of sales, research and development, technical services, finance, human resources and facilities functions; ‰ political unrest, war or terrorism, particularly in areas in which we have employees and facilities; ‰ potential vulnerability to computer system, internet or other systemic attacks, such as denial of service, viruses or other malware, any of which may be caused by criminals, terrorists or other sophisticated organizations; ‰ compliance by us and our services providers (including unaffiliated third-party service providers) with a wide variety of complex and differing local laws, regulations and treaties, including unexpected changes in (or new) legislative or regulatory requirements, such as anti-corruption, competition, anti-money laundering, export control and data privacy laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”), the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, as well as the new EU GDPR, which becomes effective in May 2018, the Network and Information Security Directive in the EU, trade controls and sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, early termination of contracts with government agencies, audits, investigations, sanctions or penalties; ‰ licenses, tariffs, export controls, economic sanctions and other trade barriers; ‰ potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the Trump administration, which has been critical of existing and proposed trade agreements; and ‰ natural disaster, disease or other extraordinary events impacting business continuity. U.S. and international laws and regulations that apply to our global operations are complex and increase our cost of doing business. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our international operations include the FCPA, economic sanctions laws and export control laws. International laws and regulations include local laws that also prohibit bribery, including commercial bribery (including the UK Bribery Act), and corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, increased export and import controls stemming from Trump administration policies, retaliatory measures or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Additionally, our operations are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, storage, transmission, use, protection and disposal of data, and new laws in this area have 55 ----- been passed by several jurisdictions, while other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. Complying with emerging and changing requirements, both domestic and international, may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. We have adopted and implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with U.S. laws and the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of these laws, rules and regulations could result in criminal or civil fines against us, our officers or our employees; restrictions on the conduct of our business; harm to our brand or reputation; and delays in potential acquisitions. Such violations could result in penalties and other restrictions that may, under certain circumstances, materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. The unique risks of operating in a particular country may require us to adopt a different business approach or strategy in that particular country, which could increase our cost of doing business or limit the type of business activities we can perform in such country. In addition, if we suffer a business disruption due to any of the risks listed above and do not have in place or are not able to implement adequate response plans, our ability to support customers and maintain normal business operations for a significant length of time could be hindered such that our competitive position could be significantly impacted.

We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Additionally, under the Credit Facilities, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under our Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our existing or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our Credit Facilities or the documentation governing our other indebtedness from repurchasing all of the Notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the Notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our Credit Facilities. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture that will govern the Notes and a cross-default under the Credit Facilities. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.

We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control.

The source of funds for any purchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under our Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our existing or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our Credit Facilities or the documentation governing our other indebtedness from repurchasing all of the Notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the Notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our Credit Facilities. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture that will govern the Notes and a cross-default under the Credit Facilities.

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 was impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance of approximately $66.1 million, primarily due to changes in estimates of the utilization of foreign tax credits and our income tax benefit was further impacted by tax expense associated with the patent litigation settlement proceeds received in April 2016 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, on October 11, 2016, the Spanish Supreme Court rendered an unfavorable ruling against the Company regarding Spanish Non Resident Income Tax derived from payments carried out by Spanish tax resident customers.

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.15,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.15.1,Revenue Recognition,"We derive revenue principally from software-related arrangements consisting of software license and maintenance offerings, non-software arrangements consisting of our SaaS offerings as well as the associated professional services for each of these types of arrangements. We recognize revenue when all of the following core revenue recognition criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the license or service has occurred; (iii) the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the arrangement fee is probable. _Software License and Maintenance Arrangements_ Software license revenue is recognized upfront on perpetual license sales when the core revenue recognition criteria above are satisfied and vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple-element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of our maintenance offerings through independent maintenance renewals. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand-alone basis, as well as management-approved pricing for certain new offerings. We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the longest expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is typically the longest maintenance term. In our time-based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value of undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms, and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license and maintenance fees in time-based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements and are included in term license and maintenance revenue in the statements of comprehensive loss. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years and in some instances, can extend up to five or more years. _Professional Services Arrangements_ Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and education services associated with our products, is derived under both time-and-material and fixed fee arrangements. In most fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on days of effort. If no discernible customer deliverable exists until the completion of the 115 ----- professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined software license and professional services revenue is recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. _SaaS Arrangements_ SaaS subscription fees are recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the subscription arrangements beginning on the date that the service is made available to customers. Additional professional services fees, principally related to optional services engagements that are not essential to the functionality of our core SaaS offerings and are considered to have stand-alone value, are generally recognized on a proportional performance basis based on days of effort. In our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, SaaS subscription revenue and optional professional services revenue are included in perpetual maintenance and SaaS revenue and professional services revenue, respectively. _Other Revenue Recognition Considerations_ In arrangements containing both software and non-software (e.g., SaaS) elements, which to date have been infrequent, we allocate the arrangement consideration first into software and non-software units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy and then apply the applicable software and non-software revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting. To date, we have determined the relative selling price of software and non-software units of accounting based on management’s best estimate of selling price as other means of determining relative selling price (e.g., VSOE or other third-party evidence) have not been available with respect to all of the components in bundled software and non-software arrangements. We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators (collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our products and services. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from financed customer transactions are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are invoiced and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency. In our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, revenue is categorized as perpetual license, perpetual maintenance and SaaS, term license and maintenance or professional services revenue. We allocate revenue from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these 116 ----- categories based on the VSOE of fair value of the elements in each revenue arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon management’s best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee.

These grants typically consist of stock options that are half time-based (the time-vesting options) and half which contain service, performance and market conditions (the performance-vesting options). The time-vesting options vest in annual increments assuming continued employment, with accelerated vesting in the event of a change of control. The performance-vesting options also vest in annual increments, assuming continued employment, the occurrence of a liquidity event and the achievement of target investor returns. Additionally, there are provisions for partial vesting for both time-vesting and performance-vesting options in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances as set forth in the terms of the award. The options are exercisable for Class B non-voting common stock. Both the time-vesting options and the performance-vesting options contain certain repurchase features that allow the Company to repurchase shares acquired by the employee through the exercise of the options, contingent upon the employee’s separation from the Company. The fair value of our common stock is used to value our share-based awards, establish the exercise price for future option grants and establish the price paid by the Company to repurchase shares acquired by former employees through the exercise of stock options upon the employee’s separation from the Company, after six months from the date of exercise. 117 ----- The fair values of the Company’s common stock were approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations, which were performed at least annually. If stock options were granted a short period of time prior to the date of a valuation report, we retrospectively assessed the fair value used for financial reporting purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-HeldCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the “AICPA Guide”), management exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including: ‰ The results of contemporaneous valuations of our common stock by unrelated third parties; ‰ Market multiples of comparable public companies in our industry as indicated by their market capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions; ‰ Our performance and market position relative to our competitors, who may change from time to time; ‰ Our historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for our future performance; and ‰ The economic and competitive environment in which we operate. The fair value of our common stock was determined using the average of the income and market approach valuation methods to estimate the Company’s enterprise value and then adjusting the enterprise value for net debt adjustments to estimate the Company’s equity value. There have been no secondary sales of our common stock or other transactions that may indicate the fair value of the common stock in an orderly market transaction. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company’s financial forecasts to estimate the value of the subject company. The fair value of an individual share of our common stock was derived by dividing the Company’s equity value by the number of outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. The fair values of our Class A and Class B common stock were the same because holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock participate equally in dividends and liquidation proceeds of the Company.

We assess goodwill for impairment as of January 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value.

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.16,"Year Ended March 31, 2018** **2017** **2016",17.16.3,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (collectively, Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes nearly all revenue recognition guidance under previously existing GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is likely that more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under previously existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts and requires enhanced disclosures. Topic 606 is effective for public companies beginning the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 and for nonpublic companies beginning the first quarter of our fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. Topic 606 may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective method) or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We anticipate adopting Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the full retrospective method. While the Company is continuing to determine the full impact of Topic 606, it currently anticipates the standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and believes the most significant effect relates to the timing of the recognition of software license revenue. Specifically, under Topic 606, the Company currently expects to recognize substantially all software license revenue, in both perpetual licensing and term licensing arrangements, at the point in time the licensed software is transferred to the customer. This represents a substantial change to our application of previously existing GAAP, under which a substantial portion of our perpetual license revenue and all of our term license revenue is generally deferred and recognized ratably, most commonly over the term of the associated maintenance arrangements but in some cases over the longest expected delivery period of other undelivered elements in the arrangement. As a result, the Company also anticipates a significant reduction in deferred license revenue upon adoption of Topic 606, principally relating to the cumulative earlier recognition of deferred license revenue recognized upon software transfer to our customers. The Company currently believes that the point-in-time recognition requirement of Topic 606 will increase the volatility of its revenue and earnings period to 121 ----- period. The Company does not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recognition for its maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. Under Topic 606, a larger portion of the Company’s sales commissions and other incremental costs to acquire contracts will be subject to capitalization as compared to our application of previously existing GAAP. However, incremental costs related to software license deliverables will be expensed as incurred whereas under our application of current GAAP, a portion of such costs are capitalized and amortized commensurate with the timing of software license revenue recognition. Additionally, the Company currently anticipates that it will amortize incremental costs related to new customer business over an expected period of benefit of approximately five years, which is generally longer than amortization periods utilized under our application of previously existing GAAP. The Company is currently assessing the potential financial statement impact of these new requirements. The Company is also currently assessing the income tax impacts related to Topic 606, mostly relating to the potential impacts from earlier recognition of revenue and the associated reduction in deferred revenue under the standard. Subject to the Company’s overall tax attributes and other factors, the adoption of Topic 606 could result in an increase in income taxes payable and accelerated cash tax payment requirements in periods subsequent to adoption of the standard in comparison to existing tax treatment. We do not believe Topic 606 will have a material impact on the timing of our customer contract billings and cash receipts, and thus on our operating or free cash flows, other than the potential tax impacts noted above. 122 -----",,as_expected,2018,334,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""The text does not indicate any exposure to risks associated with cyclical products.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""The text does not indicate any exposure to risks associated with cyclical products.""}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""The text does not indicate any exposure to risks associated with cyclical products."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nText: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (collectively, Topic 606).

Our customers use our portfolio of solutions to help ensure seamless IT operations and performance across applications and infrastructure, including new technologies that power their core business capabilities. Our solutions manage the IT systems and processes that enable mission-critical business functions such as processing payment transactions at global financial institutions, managing global airline reservations, check-in and departure processes at scale in real-time and ensuring consistent inventory and pricing data across online and brick-and-mortar storefronts. We have a culture of innovation and have consistently invested in and delivered modern solutions that address our customers’ evolving IT requirements. As IT paradigms have expanded from mainframe, to client-server, to mobile, to cloud, we have remained a trusted, market-leading provider of solutions for our customers’ important IT challenges. We are differentiated in our ability to provide ITOM solutions at the scale and sophistication required by the world’s largest organizations. Our broad, diversified base of more than 10,000 customers spans over 120 countries and a wide range of industries, including major banks, financial services firms, government agencies, technology companies, telecommunication providers, manufacturers, educational institutions, retailers and hospitals. Our clients include 97 of the Forbes Global 100. We also count as our clients 49 of the top 50 commercial banks, all of the top 25 manufacturing companies, 23 of the top 25 insurance companies and 24 of the top 25 telecom companies, based on Forbes Global rankings. Our capability and legacy of serving this massive installed base drives stickiness of our solution and provides visibility into future bookings and opportunities to grow our product penetration. Historically, the expansion of our customers’ IT infrastructures has fueled increased usage of our installed solutions within their organizations and provided new opportunities to sell additional solutions from our portfolio. Our solutions have high customer retention, which is demonstrated by approximately 80% of our non-GAAP product revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 coming from customers that have maintained a relationship with us for over 10 years. Except for one customer that represented 5.3% of our non-GAAP revenue in fiscal year 2018, no customer represented more than 5% of our non-GAAP revenue in any of the past three fiscal years. The digitization of business has placed growing demands on IT. Today, customers, employees and partners increasingly depend on speed, efficiency and security in the delivery of digital services for competitive differentiation. Across many industries, organizations are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud IT strategies to achieve cost savings, improve security, enhance agility and gain greater flexibility. Rather than replacing existing IT infrastructure, new architectures often run alongside existing infrastructure such as mainframe, adding layers of complexity and thereby compounding the demands for interoperability. In the face of these increasing business demands and architectural complexity, many organizations use ITOM solutions to move faster and improve decision making in order to compete more effectively in their markets. Enterprises increasingly require ITOM solutions that are compatible across modern and traditional infrastructures, integrate seamlessly with other software tools, and do so with the reliability and performance necessary to support intricate business use cases. We were founded in 1980 as a mainframe management software provider and we have consistently developed innovative solutions, leveraged new technologies and techniques, responded to the evolving needs of our customers and expanded our portfolio.

These trends include the growing strategic importance of IT, the increasing complexity of enterprise IT architectures, the increasing challenges enterprises face in managing IT operations and the persistence of mainframe as a core computing platform. Taken together, these trends underpin the technology tailwinds driving the growth of integrated ITOM software platforms. ‰ Market Opportunity. We believe that the global ITOM market represented over $25 billion of spend in 2017 and is expected to grow to over $38 billion of spend in 2022, representing a CAGR of approximately 7% to 8%. This projected market growth represents an opportunity for us to expand our services and revenues within the ITOM market. For additional information, see “Market, Ranking and Other Industry Data.” ‰ Growing Strategic Importance of IT. The global digitization of business has evolved IT from a supporting function to a core capability for many of today’s leading enterprises. How well a business can build, deliver and manage IT drives its ability to offer differentiated services and compete effectively in the global and online business environment. This evolution has elevated the strategic importance of IT resources in many enterprises and increased the scope of the digital services such enterprises are expected to deliver and manage. ‰ Increasing Complexity of Enterprise IT Architectures. From mainframe to client-server architecture to mobile and multi-cloud to IoT devices, the evolution of new technologies over the past several decades has expanded the scope of IT. These new technologies often are being deployed alongside existing infrastructure, necessitating the inclusion of operations management in almost all IT disciplines to run a secure and performing business. The compounding complexity of modern IT architectures — coupled with the proliferation of data and increasing transaction volumes — strains IT resources and requires new solutions that enable businesses to manage their IT infrastructures securely and efficiently. ‰ Enterprises **_Face_** **_Increasing_** **_Challenges_** **_in_** **_Managing_** **_IT_** **_Operations._** Modern IT organizations often need to manage disparate types of computing architectures and deployment models including multi-cloud, hybrid and on-premises. They also must maintain performance and availability of technology infrastructure to run mission-critical workloads and dynamically scale IT services to growing business demands. The resulting heterogeneity of modern IT environments has made managing IT operations a complex task for IT professionals. Key challenges include: - managing increasing complexity of business services running across heterogeneous, multi-cloud infrastructure; - securing the IT infrastructure by tracking compliance to identify, prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities; - containing the total cost of ownership of IT infrastructure; - identifying, locating and monitoring all IT assets within complex, multi-cloud environments; 125 ----- - enabling agile software development and IT operations so that organizations can build, deploy and scale applications at faster speeds; and - increasing efficiency, including limiting downtime, accelerating speed of delivering new services and providing faster incident resolution. ‰ Persistence of Mainframe as a Core Computing Platform. Mainframes are powerful servers, capable of processing large numbers of transactions simultaneously, while supporting thousands of applications, users and devices and operating with near perfect uptime. Superior speed, security and reliability constitute the core value proposition of the mainframe and differentiate the platform from other IT infrastructures such as distributed networks or cloud. Transaction processing, data retrieval and records management are among the most missioncritical mainframe workloads. For many of the world’s largest companies, the mainframe is and will continue to be a critical part of their IT infrastructure. Data-sensitive industries such as financial services and governments require the mainframe’s superior security features, and large companies with very high transaction volumes, such as commercial banks, retailers and airlines, rely on the speed and reliability of the mainframe. The central role mainframe servers play in modern IT infrastructure, the risk involved in moving mission critical workloads off the mainframe and the lack of viable alternatives for key use cases create significant barriers to migrating from the platform. Secular trends such as the growth of mobile transactions, proliferation of digital data and increased connectivity between IT infrastructure and endpoints are creating growth in mainframe usage. Organizations are expanding their mainframe computing capacity, measured in MIPS to effectively manage these additional demands.

We continue to pursue a favorable resolution on this matter for years prior to January 1, 2006.

The lawsuit also alleges that IBM fraudulently induced BMC to enter into the OA by non-disclosure and misrepresentation of its plans regarding the relevant customer.

As further described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer that incurs or guarantees any Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or certain future Indebtedness (and any Domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary incurs or guarantees Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities or certain capital markets debt securities) will, subject to certain exceptions and to release as provided below or elsewhere in this “Description of Notes,” guarantee the Notes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” (or the 30-day grace period set forth therein), the Issuer shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is (or becomes) a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Completion Date to execute and deliver on the Completion Date a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary. Each of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities as of the Completion Date will guarantee the Notes. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) (i) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities or (ii) the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee (except, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation, it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release) unless, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), at the time of such release or discharge, such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; (c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (e) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or 152 ----- upon the liquidation of a Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; or (f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that (i) such Guarantee shall not be released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) such Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.",,as_expected,2018,334,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Following the consummation of the Merger, the Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, whether for payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor\u2019s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are limited to the amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor\u2019s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness\u2014Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.\u201d Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (a) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) (i) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities or (ii) the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee (except, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation, it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release) unless, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), at the time of such release or discharge, such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries\u201d; (c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under \u201c\u2014Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\u201d or the Issuer\u2019s obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (e) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or 152 ----- upon the liquidation of a Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; or (f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that (i) such Guarantee shall not be released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) such Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Euro Note to provide an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (with any required attachments) or W-9 or to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide other certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; (3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Euro Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period); (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with respect to the Euro Notes or any Guarantee thereof; 159 ----- (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes; (6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Euro Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another available Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; (7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), or any law, legislation, rules or practices implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; (8) any Taxes imposed as a result of the beneficial owner being or having been (i) a \u201c10-percent shareholder\u201d of the Issuer as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any successor provision or (ii) a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code or any successor provision; (9) any Taxes imposed as a result of the Holder or beneficial owner being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business, as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision; (10) any Taxes imposed by reason of the Holder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s past or present status as a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax-exempt organization or a personal holding company with respect to the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; or (11) any combination of the items (1) through (10) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or limited liability company or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Euro Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or limited liability company or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Euro Notes directly. The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor\u2019s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Euro Note or Guarantee of a Euro Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer\u2019s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer\u2019s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer\u2019s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. 160 ----- Wherever in the Indenture, the Euro Notes or this \u201cDescription of Notes\u201d there is mentioned, in any context, with respect to the Euro Notes: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Euro Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any Guarantee of a Euro Note, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holders and beneficial owners of the Euro Notes for any present or future stamp, transfer, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Euro Note, any Guarantee of a Euro Note, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Euro Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Euro Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (10)). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Euro Notes or Guarantees thereof is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, a series of Notes (including upon an Equity Offering or in connection with another transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that 163 ----- constitutes a Change of Control) may, at the Issuer\u2019s discretion, be given prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer\u2019s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering or other transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer\u2019s discretion, the Redemption Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the applicable Redemption Date, or by the applicable Redemption Date as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer\u2019s discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the applicable redemption price and performance of the Issuer\u2019s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the Notes eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed. Notes of any series called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes of such series or portions of them called for redemption, unless such redemption remains conditioned on the happening of a future event.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; 164 ----- (4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to the applicable Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent specified in the notice receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, an electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the principal amount of the Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Dollar Notes or at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Euro Notes; (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer shall determine that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) such other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of Notes through the facilities of DTC or of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, subject to the applicable rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; 165 ----- (2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities will, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We currently have no intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control following the Completion Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that 166 ----- such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above) to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes of such series that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of _Control,” may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in_ aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",,as_expected,2018,334,

Within 450 days after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (i) to repay: (w) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (and in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); (x) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (and in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); (y) Obligations under the Notes or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of other Senior Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect thereto, if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any Senior Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer will either (1) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (A) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” or (B) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in arm’s-length privately negotiated transactions, or (2) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon; or (z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other property or assets (other than Capital Stock), in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), either (A) that is used or useful in a Similar Business or (B) that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (iii) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, in the case of clause (ii) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated_ as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of 168 ----- intent within 180 days of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within the later of 450 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days from the date of the Acceptable Commitment, and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment; _provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before_ such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired. To the extent Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes, or that is equal to €1,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Notes, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within twenty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $50.0 million by transmitting electronically or mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to applicable procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, 169 ----- any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise apply such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions described in the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Senior Credit Facilities will limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuer is contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.",,as_expected,2018,334,

If on any date following the Completion Date (i) the Notes of a series have an Investment Grade Rating from any two of the three Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), then beginning on such date and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants with respect to such series of Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”): (1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; (2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”; (3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; (5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; 170 ----- (6) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; and (7) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the “Suspension Date”), the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be reset at zero. In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) any two of the three Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes of the applicable series below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events. The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be released during the Suspension Period to the extent provided in clause (f) under “—Guarantees” and subject to the proviso thereto. If the Reversion Date occurs following a Suspension Date, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries prior to the Reversion Date will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Acquisition entered into during the Suspension Period), (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” (6) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee or direct obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period, and (7) all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Liens.” During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated on and after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the 171 ----- Indenture, the Notes of the applicable series or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants in respect of any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) on and after the Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that the Notes of any series will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness solely because such Indebtedness has a junior priority with respect to shared collateral or because it is guaranteed by other obligors.",,as_expected,2018,334,

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes through participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream.

Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Dollar Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",,as_expected,2018,334,

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",,as_expected,2018,334,

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(2) of the Code), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions under other applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation: PTCE 84-14, respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers; PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTCE 91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds; PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts; and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or 261 ----- render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, nor pays any more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code) in connection with the transaction. Each of the above noted exceptions contains certain conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",,as_expected,2018,334,

Additionally, if any purchaser or subsequent transferee of the Notes is using assets of any ERISA Plan to acquire or hold the Notes, such purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to represent that none of us, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates has acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser’s or transferee’s decision to acquire, hold, sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with respect to the Notes and none of us, the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates shall at any time be relied upon as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold, sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with respect to the Notes. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive and should not be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Each purchaser or subsequent transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of Notes (or any interest therein) does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or the provisions of applicable Similar Laws.

If you use the cash method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest received on the Euro Notes, determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate for euros on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (but may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the disposition of the euros so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to stated interest on the Euro Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued on the Euro Notes held during such year, determined by translating such stated interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) within such year during which such stated interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: ‰ the last day of the accrual period; ‰ the last day of the taxable year, if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or 265 ----- ‰ the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. If you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Euro Note (including, upon the sale or other disposition of a Euro Note, the receipt of amounts attributable to accrued stated interest previously included in income), you will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as United States source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above). _Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Euro Notes_ Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income for United States federal income tax purposes to the extent not previously included in income) and the adjusted tax basis in the Euro Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Euro Note will, in general, be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. Your U.S. dollar cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such Euro Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Euro Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros, then your amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. If, however, you are a cash method taxpayer and the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes, euros received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale or other taxable disposition. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the sale or other taxable disposition of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method taxpayer that does not make the election described above will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as United States source ordinary income or loss) upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the euros received (based on the spot rate on the settlement date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition date. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Euro Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Euro Note may be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Euro Note is your purchase price for the Euro Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference 266 ----- between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Euro Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement date of such disposition, provided the Euro Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Euro Note. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized on the disposition of a Euro Note (with respect to both principal and accrued stated interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the Euro Note. _Disposition of Euros_ Your tax basis in euros received as stated interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the euros will generally be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as United States source ordinary income or loss). _Reportable Transactions_ United States Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions.

The purchase agreement also provides that if an initial purchaser defaults the purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated. The initial purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this offering circular. The initial purchasers propose to offer each series of the Notes initially at the offering prices on the cover page of this offering circular and may also offer the Notes to selling group members at the offering price less a selling concession. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. The initial purchasers may also offer and sell the Notes to investment funds managed by affiliates of the Sponsor at a discount from the offering price set forth on the cover of this offering circular.

In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering, or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of Notes within the U.S. by a broker/dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover of this offering circular, which is the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding seven (7) business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion without notice.

Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application for or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the offering is in progress. The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased Notes sold by or for the account of such initial purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions. These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed, various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking and other related services for the Sponsor, us, the Guarantors and our affiliates for which they have received customary compensation, and they may continue to do so in the future. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed to become agents, arrangers, book-runners, managers or lenders under the Credit Facilities and will receive customary fees and expenses in connection therewith. Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, is the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Existing Credit Facilities. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are agents and lenders to us and our subsidiaries under our Existing Credit Facilities and accordingly, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering through the repayment by us of amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities if such funds are released from escrow upon consummation of the Merger. See “Use of Proceeds.” Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are also acting as joint lead arrangers with respect to the Credit Facilities and may become lenders thereunder, for which they expect to receive customary compensation. In addition, the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have also agreed to provide interim financing to the Issuer with respect to an unsecured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Merger under certain circumstances in the event that the offering of the Notes is not consummated, for which these initial purchasers will be paid customary fees. These bridge commitments will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of this offering. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are serving as financial advisors to the selling stockholders of Boxer Parent Company in connection with the Merger, for which they will receive customary fees. Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor to KKR in connection with the Merger, for which it will similarly receive customary fees. In addition, 273 ----- KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of KKR, and therefore an affiliate of Parent and the Issuer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,243.11.3,New Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted,"In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (collectively, Topic 606 or the Standard). Topic 606 supersedes nearly all revenue recognition guidance under previously existing GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is likely that more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under previously existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts and requires enhanced disclosures. Topic 606 is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2020 and early adoption is permitted. Topic 606 may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective method) or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We anticipate adopting Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the full retrospective method. F-7 ----- While the Company is continuing to determine the full impact of Topic 606, it currently anticipates the Standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and believes the most significant effect relates to the timing of the recognition of software license revenue. Specifically, under Topic 606, the Company currently expects to recognize substantially all software license revenue, in both perpetual licensing and term licensing arrangements, at the point in time the licensed software is transferred to the customer. This represents a substantial change to our application of previously existing GAAP, under which a substantial portion of our perpetual license revenue and all of our term license revenue is generally deferred and recognized ratably, most commonly over the term of the associated maintenance arrangements but in some cases over the longest expected delivery period of other undelivered elements in the arrangement. As a result, the Company also anticipates a significant reduction in deferred license revenue upon adoption of Topic 606, principally relating to the cumulative earlier recognition of deferred license revenue recognized upon software transfer to our customers. The Company currently believes that the point-in-time recognition requirement of Topic 606 will increase the volatility of its revenue and earnings period to period. The Company does not currently expect Topic 606 to have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recognition for its maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. Under Topic 606, a larger portion of the Company’s sales commissions and other incremental costs to acquire contracts will be subject to capitalization as compared to our application of previously existing GAAP. However, incremental costs related to software license deliverables will be expensed as incurred whereas under our application of current GAAP, a portion of such costs are capitalized and amortized commensurate with the timing of software license revenue recognition. Additionally, the Company currently anticipates that it will amortize incremental costs related to new customer business over an expected period of benefit of approximately five years, which is generally longer than amortization periods utilized under our application of previously existing GAAP. The Company is currently assessing the potential financial statement impact of these new requirements. The Company is also currently assessing the income tax impacts related to Topic 606, mostly relating to the potential impacts from earlier recognition of revenue and the associated reduction in deferred revenue under the Standard. Subject to the Company’s overall tax attributes and other factors, the adoption of Topic 606 could result in an increase in income taxes payable and accelerated cash tax payment requirements in periods subsequent to adoption of the Standard in comparison to existing tax treatment. We do not believe Topic 606 will have a material impact on the timing of our customer contract billings and cash receipts, and thus on our operating or free cash flows, other than the potential tax impacts noted above.",,as_expected,2018,334,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,243.11.4,Use of Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, valuation of intangible assets as well as their associated useful lives, valuation of share-based compensation, capitalization and amortization of software development costs, the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and accounting for unrecognized tax benefits.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,243.11.6,Receivables,"In the ordinary course of business, we extend credit to our customers on both trade and financed terms. Trade and finance receivables are recorded at their outstanding principal balances, adjusted for interest receivable to date, if applicable, and adjusted by the allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest income on finance receivables is recognized using the effective interest method and is presented as other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Interest income on these finance receivables was $6.5 million, $4.5 million and $5.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider the length of time receivable balances have been outstanding, historical collection experience, current economic conditions and customer-specific information. When we ultimately conclude that a receivable is uncollectible, the balance is charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable was $3.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

Upon acquisition, goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. If a reorganization causes the Company’s reporting units to change, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units based on their relative fair values. We assess goodwill for impairment as of January 1 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. When conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a three step process. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step for that reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, determined using a combination of the income and market approaches on an invested capital basis, to its respective carrying value (including goodwill) as of the date of the impairment test. The third step, employed for any reporting unit whose carrying value exceeds its fair value, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative, the Company does not follow this three-step process, and instead performs a qualitative evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more likely than not impaired, the third step discussed above is performed to determine if there is an impairment and measure the amount of any potential impairment.",,as_expected,2018,334,

As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple-element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of our maintenance offerings through independent maintenance renewals. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand-alone basis, as well as management-approved pricing for certain new offerings. We are unable to establish VSOE of the fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of the fair value of all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of the fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the longest expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is typically the longest maintenance term. In our time-based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of the fair value of undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms, and VSOE of the fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license and maintenance fees in time-based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements and are included in term license and maintenance revenue in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual terms of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years and in some instances can extend up to five or more years.",,as_expected,2018,334,

We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from financed customer transactions are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are invoiced and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency. In our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, revenue is categorized as perpetual license, perpetual maintenance and SaaS, term license and maintenance or professional services revenue.

To the extent the index interest rate exceeds the strike rate on an interest rate reset date, the counterparty will pay us an amount equal to the notional amount of the Interest Rate Cap multiplied by the amount by which the index interest rate exceeds the Interest Rate Cap’s strike rate. The €400.0 million Euro-denominated Interest Rate Cap was not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes during the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and matured on September 3, 2016. The $2,304.0 million Interest Rate Cap was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability of interest payments under the U.S. Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) and matured on September 6, 2016. The $1,728.0 million Interest Rate Cap was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability of interest payments under the U.S. Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) and was de-designated effective December 25, 2016. The €300.0 million Euro-denominated Interest Rate Cap is designated as a cash F-15 ----- flow hedge of the variability of interest payments under the Foreign Euro Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate (EURIBOR). The critical terms of those Interest Rate Caps designated as cash flow hedges closely match those of the hedged portions of the Term Loans and the derivative instruments were, or are expected to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged forecasted future interest payments associated with the hedged portions of the underlying debt. In October 2013, we entered into four cross currency interest rate swap agreements (the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps) on a total notional amount of $335.0 million. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company terminated all the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps in connection with the repayment of the Foreign USD Term Loans pursuant to Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 4 (both as defined in Note 5) for total proceeds of $44.7 million, representing the fair value of the swaps on the termination dates. We recognized a net loss of $4.4 million, which is included in other income (expense), net, during the year ended March 31, 2018, related to the terminations. The Foreign Cross Currency Swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of interest payments under the Foreign USD Term Loans due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rates (LIBOR) and the variability of the principal balance due to changes in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. The critical terms of the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps closely matched those of the hedged portions of the Foreign USD Term Loans and, until their termination, the derivative instruments were highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged forecasted future interest payments as well as foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with the hedged portions of the Foreign USD Term Loans. In September 2016, we entered into a cross currency swap (the U.S. Cross Currency Swap) on a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and a deferred premium currency call option (the USD/EUR Option) with a U.S. dollar/Euro strike price of approximately 1.35. Under the terms of the U.S. Cross Currency Swap, we swapped U.S. dollar variable-rate interest payments on $1.0 billion of principal of the U.S. Term Loans for a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.62% on a fixed Euro notional amount of €889.4 million (determined based on a Euro spot exchange rate of 1.12). The counterparty pays us an amount equal to the U.S. dollar notional amount multiplied by the applicable variable interest rate, and we pay the counterparty a fixed interest payment equal to the Euro notional amount multiplied by the fixed interest rate. Upon final settlement at maturity of the U.S. Cross Currency Swap, we will pay the counterparty €444.7 million and will receive $500.0 million from the counterparty. The U.S. Cross Currency Swap matures on September 10, 2019. Under the terms of the USD/EUR Option, we pay a quarterly premium at a fixed rate of 0.88% on a fixed Euro notional of €444.7 million. Upon final settlement at maturity of the USD/EUR Option, we have the option to pay the counterparty $600.0 million and to receive €444.7 million from the counterparty, limiting our exposure to changes in Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates related to the final settlement of the U.S. Cross Currency Swap. The USD/EUR Option also matures on September 10, 2019.

Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial for all periods presented. Changes in the fair value of the €400.0 million Eurodenominated Interest Rate Cap, the $1,728.0 million Interest Rate Cap (subsequent to December 25, 2016), the U.S. Cross Currency Swap and the USD/EUR Option are recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

We evaluate the credit risk of trade finance receivables quarterly using an internal credit rating system based on whether an individual receivable meets specific internal criteria, including counterparty credit rating and receivable maturity date, and assign an internal credit rating of 1, 2 or 3, with a credit rating of 1 representing the best credit quality. F-17 ----- At March 31, 2018 and 2017, our trade finance receivables balances by region and by internal credit rating were as follows:",,as_expected,2018,334,

In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying business. Changes in our assumptions, plans and estimates may materially impact our income tax benefit. We maintain a valuation allowance against certain tax credits and net operating and capital loss carryforwards that we do not believe are more likely than not to be utilized in the future. The valuation allowance increased (decreased) by $78.7 million, $(66.1) million and $66.4 million during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These changes to the valuation allowance are primarily due to changes in estimates of the utilization of foreign tax credits, which for fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the Tax Act. At March 31, 2018, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $373.0 million, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $113.3 million, research and development tax credit carryforwards of $3.9 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $2.3 million, all of which expire between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2036. Certain of the federal net operating loss carryforward assets are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be fully realized. The capital loss carryforward is subject to expiration after the five-year limitation and will expire in fiscal 2021. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we did not consider any of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As a result of the Tax Act, we re-evaluated our assertion regarding indefinite reinvestment and for the year ended March 31, 2018, the temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 for the impact F-29 ----- of the change in assertion. Therefore, a deferred tax liability is not recorded for the temporary difference related to our book and tax basis investment in our foreign subsidiaries. This temporary difference is primarily related to goodwill that is recorded for GAAP but that has no tax basis and will become taxable only in an unusual, infrequent impairment event or upon a subsequent sale of the foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that the deferred tax liability as of March 31, 2018 for this temporary difference, if recorded, is approximately $97 million. We carry out our business operations through legal entities in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. These jurisdictions require that we file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S., state and foreign tax laws. We are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in these multiple jurisdictions. Our tax years are closed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) through the tax year ended March 31, 2012. In June 2015, the favorable decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals related to the year ended March 31, 2006 became final, and a refund of $18.7 million, which includes both tax and interest, was received from the IRS during the year ended March 31, 2017. In addition, certain tax years related to local, state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination. To provide for potential tax exposures, we maintain a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which we believe is adequate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $25.3 million. On October 11, 2016, the Spanish Supreme Court rendered an unfavorable ruling against the Company regarding Spanish Non Resident Income Tax derived from payments carried out by Spanish tax resident customers. As a result, the Company recorded additional tax expense of approximately $15 million, including related penalties and interest, during the year ended March 31, 2017. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within benefit for income taxes. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. We recognized a net benefit of $1.8 million, $1.3 million and $14.1 million related to interest and penalties during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $12.1 million and $14.1 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total amount of tax accrued related to uncertain tax positions was $26.2 million and $29.5 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.",,as_expected,2018,334,

The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

Concurrent with the consummation of the Acquisition, the full amount of the Term Loans was drawn. Proceeds from the Term Loans were net of a discount of $38.9 million. The aggregate original principal amounts of the U.S. Term Loans, the Foreign USD Term Loans and the Foreign Euro Term Loans were $2,880.0 million, $335.0 million and €500.0 million, respectively. The Term Loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount for each interest period at floating rates, as specified in the Credit Agreement, based on either, at our election, the prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, subject to a floor (each as defined), plus applicable spreads as specified in the Credit Agreement, payable in arrears on the last day of each interest period. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted-average effective interest rate for the Term Loans was 5.2%, prior to the effect of derivative instruments. As discussed in Note 2, the Interest Rate Caps minimize the impact of increases in interest rates on interest payments associated with the Term Loans. These Interest Rate Caps limit our exposure to the Eurocurrency Rate component of interest rates on the hedged portions of the Term Loans to a maximum rate of 5.00% from September 2016 through September 2018. Additionally, we were party to the Foreign Cross Currency Swaps on a total notional amount of $285.0 million to swap U.S. dollar variable-rate interest payments on a portion of the Term Loans for an average fixed interest rate of 5.84% on a fixed Euro notional amount of €208.5 million prior to their termination during the year ended March 31, 2018. In September 2016, we entered into the U.S. Cross Currency Swap on a total notional amount of $1.0 billion to swap U.S. dollar variable-rate interest payments on a portion of the U.S. Term Loans for a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.62% on a fixed Euro notional amount of €889.4 million, and we entered into the USD/ EUR Option with a U.S. dollar/Euro strike price of approximately 1.35 to swap U.S. dollars for Euros, limiting our exposure to changes in Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates related to the U.S. Cross Currency Swap. In April 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 3) to extend the maturity date of the Term Loans to September 2022 (accelerated to April 2021 if the aggregate principal balance of the 2021 Notes is more than $700.0 million on April 15, 2021), which may be further extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and to refinance the principal F-23 ----- amounts. Amendment No. 3 resulted in outstanding principal amounts under the U.S. Term Loans, the Foreign USD Term Loans and the Foreign Euro Term Loans of $2,354.1 million, $284.7 million and €690.0 million, respectively. Amendment No. 3 also reduced the interest rate floor applicable to the Foreign Euro Term Loans from 1.0% to 0.0%, and reduced the spread for the U.S. Term Loans from 4.0% to 3.75% if the first lien leverage ratio (as defined) is less than or equal to 3.75:1.00. In December 2017, the Company further amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 4) to refinance the principal amounts and adjust the applicable spreads of the Term Loans. Amendment No. 4 resulted in outstanding principal amounts under the U.S. Term Loans and Foreign Euro Term Loans of $2,482.3 million and €923.6 million, respectively, and the principal balance of the Foreign USD Term Loans was fully repaid. Amendment No. 4 also reduced the interest rate spread and the interest rate floor applicable to the U.S. Term Loans from 3.75% to 3.25% and from 1.0% to 0.0%, respectively, and reduced the interest rate spread for the Foreign Euro Term Loans from 4.50% to 3.75%. These Credit Agreement amendments resulted in the repayment of debt with certain lenders in the syndicate for total repayments of $1,013.6 million, and the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.8 million, representing the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with the debt extinguishment. These Credit Agreement amendments also resulted in new borrowings from certain lenders in the syndicate with proceeds totaling $1,146.3 million, net of a discount of $9.0 million and $17.3 million in debt issuance costs. The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity. Subject to certain prepayment premiums and penalties and the payment of customary “breakage” costs, we may voluntarily prepay the Term Loans at any time. Subject to certain exceptions, the Term Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to: (i) 100% of the net proceeds (as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) from certain non-ordinary course sales or other dispositions of assets, (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of debt (other than indebtedness permitted by the Credit Agreement) and (iii) 50% of annual excess cash flow (as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement with step-downs to 25% and 0% based upon achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios).

Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October of each year and is required to be paid in cash unless certain conditions are met that would allow the Company to pay all or a portion of interest by increasing the principal amount of the PIK Notes or by issuing new notes (PIK Interest). Cash interest accrues at 9.000%, and PIK Interest would accrue at 9.750%. All interest payments for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were paid in cash. The effective interest rate of the PIK Notes is 9.6% The PIK Notes are redeemable at our option at any time at the redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the PIK Notes at rates specified in the PIK Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as specified in the PIK Indenture), we must offer to purchase the PIK Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase. F-25 ----- The PIK Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends, make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock; make loans, investments and other restricted payments; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; or enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends. A breach of the covenants under the PIK Indenture could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal and/or related interest payments.

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. For our fiscal 2018 tax year, we utilized a blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 31.5% based on the weighted average daily tax rate. The Tax Act also contains multiple other provisions impacting us, including the creation of a territorial-style tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries (the Transition Tax) as well as other provisions that we will continue to evaluate in future periods. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118) requires that a company include in its financial statements the reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimates have been determined. SAB 118 permits a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has permitted private companies to apply SAB 118, which we have elected to do. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded the following provisional amounts that resulted in a net charge of $108.4 million recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018: (i) a $175.7 million charge related to the Transition Tax, net of Transition Tax-related foreign tax credits; (ii) a $76.2 million valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that are not expected to be utilized because of changes to the international tax provisions of the Tax Act; and (iii) an offsetting $143.5 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. based on the new lower federal corporate tax rate. The Company will continue to refine these provisional amounts and final impacts may differ from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, completion of our tax calculations through the end of the measurement period permitted under SAB 118 and consideration of additional guidance that may be published by U.S. tax authorities. The Tax Act also established new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax rules. Because of the complexity of the GILTI rules, we are in the early stage of evaluating the tax accounting impacts including whether we will make an accounting policy election to either (i) treat taxes due on future U.S. GILTI inclusions in taxable income as a current expense when incurred (the period cost method) or (ii) factor such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the deferred method). Multiple factors must be evaluated before we can make this determination and fully assess the impacts of the GILTI rules. Therefore, we have not yet recorded any income tax accounting impacts associated with this provision of the Tax Act.

946,Final Offerings 2018.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.33,(8) Share-Based Compensation,243.33.1,,"The Company has issued stock options to its executives and other employees which primarily vest in annual increments over four or five years, with a term of ten years. These grants typically consist of stock options that are half time-based (the time-vesting options) and half which contain service, performance and market conditions (the performance-vesting options). The time-vesting options vest in annual increments assuming continued employment, with accelerated vesting in the event of a change of control. The performance-vesting options also vest in annual increments, assuming continued employment, the occurrence of a liquidity event and the achievement of target investor returns. Additionally, there are provisions for partial vesting for both time-vesting and performance-vesting options in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances as set forth in the terms of the award. The options are exercisable for Class B non-voting common stock. Both the time-vesting options and the performance-vesting options contain certain repurchase features that allow the Company to repurchase shares acquired by the employee through the exercise of the options, contingent upon the employee’s separation from the Company, after six months from the date of exercise. F-30 ----- Additionally, the Company issues long-term incentive awards with share settlement features to certain employees (the LTIP Awards). The LTIP Awards consist of both time-based awards, which vest 1/3 per year over three years, and performance-based awards, which vest 1/3 per year over three years, further adjusted from 0% to 200% of the target payout based on the achievement of certain financial metrics. The LTIP Awards are settled in cash unless the Company, any affiliate of the Company or any successor entity to the Company is a publicly-traded company, in which case the LTIP Awards are settled in stock. The LTIP Awards are accounted for as liability awards. In April 2014, the Company paid a dividend to its stockholders of $56.1959 per share. In connection with this dividend, the exercise price of the performance-vesting options outstanding at the date of the dividend was adjusted to reflect the effects of the dividend. The outstanding time-vesting options were modified to provide for future cash settlement of a portion of the award representing the amount by which the exercise price would have been adjusted to reflect the dividend. In connection with this modification, these time-vesting option holders received rights to future cash payments totaling approximately $35 million, representing the equivalent of the exercise price adjustment, payable annually over the original vesting term of the award, with the first payment accelerated to May 2014. In February 2018, the Company approved the Boxer Parent Company Inc. Stock Option Exchange Plan (the Exchange Plan), which allows approximately 25 option holders to receive cash proceeds in exchange for the cancellation of a limited quantity of time-vesting options or performancevesting options. The value received in cash is equal to the intrinsic value of the options cancelled under the Exchange Plan, based on the Company’s approved stock value on each of four Exchange Dates (as defined in the Exchange Plan), which are set to 20 days after the January 1 or July 1 stock valuation has been approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee (i.e., two dates in calendar 2018 and two dates in calendar 2019). A participant must have completed two years of service prior to the relevant Exchange Date to be eligible, and the aggregate amount of options that a participant may exchange pursuant to the Exchange Plan generally is limited to a maximum of 30% of a participant’s options outstanding as of November 1, 2017, and a participant may exchange no more than 10% of such outstanding options on any one Exchange Date. The Exchange Plan represented a modification of the options eligible to be exchanged, and these options are accounted for as liability awards as of the modification date. The modification resulted in incremental share-based compensation expense of $19.5 million, as of the modification date, for the year ended March 31, 2018. The first Exchange Date occurred subsequent to March 31, 2018. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we had stock option activity as follows:",,as_expected,2018,334,
