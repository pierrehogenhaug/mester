614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.2,Notice to prospective investors in the European Economic Area (“EEA”),3.2.1,,"The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs ----- Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH YOU SHOULD READ BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES.

These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum. Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum. Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations are: - changes in the decisions of insurance carriers and changes in the trends of the insurance industry; - industry competition; - unexpected fluctuations in our commission income related to our (re)insurance business as well as in our profit commissions related to our underwriting activities due to factors out of our control; - general volatility of the economy, inflation and geopolitical tensions; - identifying and consummating acquisitions or successfully integrating acquired business; - exposure to new business challenges and risks; - inability to successfully implement and maintain our various growth strategies and internal controls; - the risk of slow-down to our recent rapid growth; - reliance on third party service providers to perform key business functions; - failure to build, maintain, protect and enhance our brand image and reputation; - the loss of services of David Howden; - the loss of services of key members of senior management; - security breaches, data leakages, cyberattacks or other information security incidents involving personal or sensitive information, including our clients’ personal information, and any litigation, demands for ransom, penalties or fines; - regulatory, business and economic risks associated with our international operations; - failure to comply with regulations and guidelines; - changes in the regulatory approach to our commission-based earning model; - changes to trade rules and regulations resulting from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; ----- - the level of governmental regulation and supervision applicable to future acquisitions; - the outcome of legal proceedings, claims or investigations; - errors and omissions claims by our clients; - failure to comply with fiduciary regulations relating to handling of client funds; - infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property; - risk of data leakage and cybersecurity; - legislative or taxation changes or enforcement actions applicable to our business; - failure to comply with economic, social and governance regulations; - increases in the interest rates and the cost of incurring in new debt; - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; - substantial leverage and debt service obligations; - exposure to credit and liquidity risk; - inability to collect our receivables; - impairments to our goodwill and other intangible assets; - ineffective implementation of our derivative instruments; - changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions; - other factors relating to our indebtedness and financial information, the Notes, our structure, the Guarantees, the Collateral described in more detail under “Risk Factors”; and - other factors beyond our control.

Unless stated otherwise, the consolidated financial information of HGH Limited as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021 is extracted from the 2021 Financial Statements with the exception of certain line items in the cash flow statement which have been restated in the consolidated financial statements of HGH Limited and HGH Finance for the year ended September 30, 2022. Such restated amounts have therefore been extracted from the unaudited comparative column in the HGH Limited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, such figures also being consistent with the equivalent figures in the 2022 Financial Statements. The restated consolidated cash flow statement for HGH Limited for the year ended September 30, 2021 has not been audited by Deloitte LLP. For details of the restatements, please refer to the “Selected Historical Financial Data”; collectively, the “Financial Statements”. The Financial Statements were audited in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“UK ISAs”), as stated in each of EY’s and Deloitte’s independent auditor reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. On September 27, 2021, a new holding company, HGH Finance, was created and was subsequently inserted between HGH Limited and the operating subsidiaries of the Group on January 25, 2022. Therefore, at September 30, 2021 and for the year then ended, the financial statements of the Group were consolidated and reported at the level of HGH Limited. Accordingly, the 2021 Financial Statements and the comparative financial information presented in the Offering Memorandum for the year ended September 30, 2021 represent that of the Group as consolidated and reported at the level of HGH Limited. HGH Finance subsequently acquired all of the subsidiaries and primary operations (other than certain holding company operations) from its ultimate parent company, HGH Limited, on January 25, 2022 in a common control transaction outside of the scope of IFRS 3—Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”). As such, the 2022 Financial Statements represent the continuation of the Group previously headed by HGH Limited. These accounts were prepared on this basis with comparatives presented as if the Group consolidated its financial statements at the level of HGH Finance as at October 1, 2020. As a result of this presentation and, in each case, in accordance with IFRS 3, in the 2022 Financial Statements: - the share capital of HGH for the comparative period is based on HGH Finance’s share capital as at January 25, 2022; - the carrying value assets and liabilities transferred from HGH Limited to HGH Finance are measured at the book value of those assets as at the date of transfer. The value of those assets and liabilities was not recalculated on a fair value basis; - any equity transactions entered into by HGH Limited itself such as share buy backs or subscriptions for new share capital prior to the transfer on January 25, 2022, for the year ended September 30, 2022, have been treated and disclosed as transactions with former equity holders within equity in the HGH Finance financial statements; and - the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended September 30, 2021 presented in the Offering Memorandum presents the HGH Limited Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended ----- September 30, 2021; however, these amounts have been restated in accordance with the classification for the year ended September 30, 2022. Any resulting differences within equity of the shareholders of HGH Finance compared to the Group consolidated at the level of HGH Limited resulting from above items and balance sheet items not transferred across from HGH Limited to HGH Finance are balanced with an entry into the merger reserve. Similarly, equity transactions entered into by HGH Limited itself are presented as transactions with the former equity holders. Other than the reclassifications in connection with share capital and equity transactions described above and in the footnotes to the “Selected Historical Financial Data,” there are no material differences between the financial information of HGH Limited and HGH Finance as consolidating entities. Therefore, we believe that the 2021 Financial Statements are directly comparable to the 2022 Financial Statements for all material purposes with the exception of the HGH Limited Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended September 30, 2021 being presented on a restated basis, as noted above. Holders of the Notes will receive consolidated financial statements of HGH Finance pursuant to the reporting provisions in the Indenture, although we may in the future provide consolidated financial statements of another entity in compliance with such reporting provisions. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and _Other Information” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information.”_ Unless stated otherwise, the consolidated financial information of HGH Limited as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021 is extracted from the 2021 Financial Statements with the exception of certain line items in the cash flow statement which have been restated in the consolidated financial statements of HGH Limited for the year ended September 30, 2022. For details of the restatements, please refer to the “Selected Historical _Financial Data”._ For the 2022 Financial Statements and 2023 Financial Statements, HGH Finance prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (“IFRS UK”). IFRS UK comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) as adopted in the UK that were in effect as at September 30, 2023, or which were adopted early. For the 2021 Financial Statements, HGH Limited prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (the “IFRS EU”). IFRS EU comprise standards and interpretations approved by IASB and IFRIC as adopted by the European Union that were in effect as at September 30, 2021, or which were adopted early. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS UK and applicable law requires that management make use of certain critical accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments” and in the notes to the Financial_ Statements. In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditors’ reports from each of EY and Deloitte state that the reports (including the opinions) were prepared for and only for the Group’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditors do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone else other than the company’s members, as a body, for their audit work, their reports, or for the opinions formed save where expressly agreed by their prior consent in writing. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Such information and data have not been subject to any audit or review procedures carried out by any independent auditor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.11,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,3.11.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains various financial measures and ratios that are not presented in accordance with IFRS (collectively, “Non-IFRS Measures”). We present these Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that these and similar measures are widely used by certain investors as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity, and that this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring and comparing our operating performance with other companies across the periods presented. Such Non-IFRS Measures are unaudited. We present the following Non-IFRS Measures used in this Offering Memorandum: _“EBITDA” is defined as (loss)/profit before finance income and finance costs, income tax expense (benefit),_ depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA provides relevant and useful information for investors and management to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, tax position, depreciation and amortization and certain other items that we believe do not reflect our core business. _“Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA, adjusted to reflect:_ (i) fair value movements on deferred and contingent consideration arrangements, put options held by non-controlling interests of certain subsidiaries and investments held at fair value through the income statement, (ii) adjustments relating to non-operating items such as gain/loss on disposal of operations and dividends from equity investments held at fair value, (iii) adjustments for New Initiatives, which refer to new hires from expansion into new territories or new product lines that do not yet generate profit and take time to reach run rate profitability as they build a client base; this adjustment relates to the add-back of EBITDA losses of these lateral hires incurred in the financial year during this growth phase (the increase year on year relates to various programs within Insurance, Reinsurance and DUAL, including new hires driven by market dislocation arising from M&A in the insurance market), (iv) other cost adjusting items which are not considered run-rate costs or relating to the underlying performance of the Group; please refer to Summary Historical Financial Information and Other _Data for further details of this adjustment,_ (v) acquisition costs, which relate to professional and other incremental costs directly attributable to acquisitions and disposals of businesses and minority interests, (vi) IFRS adjustments, which adjust for non-cash transactions required to be recognized in profit and loss under IFRS, (vii) adjustments relating to the pre-acquisition EBITDA attributable to acquisitions (M&A) during the year acquired, to present the run rate as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, (viii) adjustments to remove the pre-disposal results of entities that were disposed of or closed by the Group during the fiscal year that do not qualify as discontinued operations under IFRS 5—Non_current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (“IFRS 5”), to present the run rate as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, and (ix) the unrealized portion of identifiable cost reduction savings programs currently undertaken and the expected benefit that would have been realized if they were in effect from the beginning of the year. ----- We believe Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by management because it provides a clear representation of our operating performance and the profitability of our business on a run-rate basis and eliminates the impact of the items that do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of the business. _“Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA excluding M&A and cost synergies” is defined as Adjusted Consolidated_ EBITDA, less pro forma pre-acquisition results of M&A and closed operations, and less pro forma results of cost synergy programs. _“Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of our_ Adjusted Revenue for the relevant period. _“Adjusted Revenue” is defined as IFRS Revenue adjusted for (i) the pre-acquisition revenue attributable to_ M&A during the year acquired, to present the run rate as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, (ii) the pre-disposal results of entities that were disposed of or closed by the Group during the fiscal year that do not qualify as discontinued operations under IFRS 5, to present the run rate as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, and (iii) other adjustments, which mainly represent the reversing IFRS 15 impacts for M&A in the year which are non-run rate in nature as well as some intercompany adjustments. _“IFRS Revenue” is defined as revenue in accordance with IFRS, consisting of fees and commissions, insurance_ underwriting income, and other operating income. _“Organic Revenue” is defined as IFRS Revenue adjusted for (i) revenue attributable to M&A during the first_ 12 months of the Group’s ownership as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, adjusted to a constant average foreign exchange rate for the year in which the reconciliation is performed. The comparative is also restated for acquisitions made during the current year to include the pre-acquisition results for the preceding year so that the perimeter is constant for purposes of calculating Organic Revenue Growth, (ii) operations that were disposed of or closed by the Group during the fiscal year that do not qualify as discontinued operations under IFRS 5, to present the run rate as if they had been made at the start of the financial year, adjusted to a constant average foreign exchange rate for the year in which the reconciliation is performed, (iii) additional commissions which can be earned by DUAL that are contingent on the underwriting result of the underlying contracts. The income on the performance of an underwriting year can take a number of years to realize and is highly variable in both quantum and timing. Therefore, volatility of the DUAL profit contingent commissions does not aid in the understanding of the organic growth of the business, (iv) other foreign exchange adjustments to IFRS revenue to achieve a constant foreign exchange rate for the year in which the reconciliation is performed, (v) adjustment for the non-run rate elements of IFRS 15 and (vi) add-back for the insurance income as per the Statement of Profit or Loss. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. _“Organic Revenue Growth” is defined as a percentage change in Organic Revenue, as compared to the same_ period for the prior year. Organic Revenue Growth is a key metric used by management to assess our financial performance. We believe that Organic Revenue Growth is an appropriate measure of our operating performance as it allows management and investors understand and evaluate the growth of our business without the impacts of acquisitions, which provides a meaningful and consistent manner to evaluate such growth from period to period on a consistent basis. _“Maintenance CapEx” is defined as the cash expenditure on the purchase of property, plant and equipment_ and intangibles assets, less investment capital expenditure and less cash expenditure on the purchase of intangible assets. “Management Operating Cash” is defined as cash generated from operations, adjusted for (i) cash outflows on the movement in insurance cash, (ii) cash inflows on investment in New Initiatives treated as an investment activity, (iii) cash inflows on exceptional items deemed non-run rate in nature, (iv) cash flows on Maintenance CapEx, (v) cash flows to pay for accrued transaction expenses on the Align acquisition, (vi) cash inflows on employee loans, and (vii) other adjustments. We believe that Management Operating Cash provides relevant and useful information on the ability of the business to generate cash from its mature operations on an ongoing basis with improved comparability between periods and eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to ongoing operating cash generation of the business. ----- “New Initiatives”represents costs attributed to new hires which take time to reach run rate profitability as they build a client base in new territories or new product lines. “Operating Cash Conversion” is defined as Management Operating Cash divided by Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA excluding M&A and cost synergies. “Pro Forma Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA” represents adjustments to our Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA in connection with certain M&A activity following September 30, 2023, which, as a result, were not consolidated within our financial results. In particular, we have adjusted our Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA to reflect the estimated pro forma EBITDA contribution from entities (i) the acquisitions of which were completed after September 30, 2023 (the “Recently Completed Acquisitions”), (ii) for which acquisition agreements have been executed and consummation of the acquisitions pending (“Acquisitions under SPAs”) and (iii) the acquisitions of which are currently subject to letters of intent (“LOIs”) and expected to complete within three months following the date of this Offering Memorandum (“Acquisitions under LOIs”) (the acquisitions described in (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Near-Term Acquisitions”) assuming each of the acquisitions had occurred on October 1, 2022 instead of the actual acquisition dates. The adjustments to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are based on good faith estimates of management of the pricing EBITDA of each entity, re-claculated on a post-IFRS 16 basis where needed, and aggregated for all of the Near-Term Acquisitions. Pricing EBITDA, in turn, is based on the results of operations of the targets as provided by the sellers, which financial information may not have been prepared, adjusted or presented in line with that of the Group. _“Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue” represents adjustments to our Adjusted Revenue in connection with certain_ M&A activity following September 30, 2023, which, as a result, were not consolidated within our financial results. In particular, we have adjusted our Adjusted Revenue to reflect the estimated pro forma revenue contribution from Near-Term Acquisitions (see also “—Pro Forma Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA”) assuming each of the acquisitions had occurred on October 1, 2022 instead of the actual acquisition dates. The adjustments to Adjusted Revenue are based on the results of operations of the targets as provided by the sellers, which financial information may not have been prepared, adjusted or presented in line with that of the Group. Pro Forma Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue (the “Pro forma Adjusted Financial Data”) have been presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be what our financial data would have actually been had the Near-Term Acquisitions occurred on the date assumed, nor do they purport to project our financial data for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Adjusted and Pro Forma Financial Information.” Although we believe the adjustments relating to the Near-Term Acquisitions to be accurate, the underlying information for such adjustments has been received from the sellers during the sale process and cannot be independently verified by our management, has not been independently reviewed or audited, may be prepared on a basis different than our own data and in some cases was based on estimated full year outturns. We cannot assure you that the financial statements of the Near-Term Acquisitions would not be materially different if such statements were audited or that the results of our Recently Completed Acquisitions match those shown below. Although there is no assurance that the Near-Term Acquisitions that have not closed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum will close or the timing thereof, we expect they will close within three months following the date of this Offering Memorandum and we expect to fund such acquisitions with cash on hand, including the net proceeds from the Transactions. “Total Debt”refers to all indebtedness shown in the “As Adjusted”column of the table under “Capitalization.” “Total Net Debt” is defined as Total Debt less Cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash is not included in Cash and cash equivalents. “Total Operating Expenses” is defined as the sum of certain IFRS line items from the Consolidated Income Statement, being other operating costs, insurance expense, impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets, and depreciation and amortization. The above non-IFRS measures should not be considered as measures of cash that will be available to meet the Group’s obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Group’s IFRS ----- results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate the Group’s performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in the Group’s presentation of the non-IFRS measures and whether you consider each to be appropriate. Further, the above non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes the Group may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of cash flows; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - they do not reflect the Group’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group’s working capital needs; and - other companies in the industry may calculate these measures differently than the Group does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a further discussion and_ quantification of non-IFRS financial measures used in this Offering Memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and to investors and reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Industry,9.2.1,Insurance Distribution Value Chain,"The insurance industry comprises the following functions: Retail Brokers:_ They assist clients, including individuals, businesses, and public institutions, to identify their insurance needs and secure appropriate insurance policies. The broking process involves negotiating policy terms and placing the client’s risk with a suitable insurer, either directly or via an underwriting agency or a wholesale broker. Wholesale Brokers:_ They function as intermediaries between retail brokers and insurance carriers, typically in specialty lines of insurance. Wholesale brokers focus on the more complex or high-risk coverage areas and typically do not have direct contact with the insured, and instead provide access to insurance carriers and products that a retail broker might otherwise not have. In some cases, wholesale brokers also serve as intermediaries between underwriting agencies and insurance carriers. Reinsurance Brokers:_ They facilitate the transfer of risk from an insurance carrier to a reinsurer, aiding in the diversification and management of the insurer’s risk exposure. Underwriting Agencies:_ They serve as intermediaries between insurance companies and brokers or customers. These agencies may act as MGAs, which issue and administer policies, handle claims, and oversee renewals on behalf of insurance companies. They carry out most of the traditional insurer activities, including underwriting and pricing, except for providing capital and incurring liabilities for claims. Their performance is measured by underwriting results. Their profitability may also be influenced by “loss-sharing” agreements with insurance companies, which are contingent on the agencies’ underwriting performance.

We assist our clients in devising appropriate risk mitigation strategies through insurance products and enable the placement of insurance policies with insurance carriers and reinsurers. We do not assume underwriting risk for the insurance policies we assist in placing and the compensation model for our services typically involves commissions based on premium levels or fees for services rendered. Consequently, the performance of the insurance brokerage sector is dependent on the economic performance of the broader insurance and reinsurance markets, reflected in the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is dependent on the insurance rates and the underlying amount of coverage purchased. The amount of coverage purchased is typically correlated to the overall GDP level and macroeconomic factors underlying each specific client industry and/or risk class. Insurance rates are cyclical in nature and vary between “hard”markets, where premium rates are increasing, and “soft”markets, where rates are declining. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

It is generally categorized into traditional P&C and specialty lines. Traditional P&C lines include coverage for commercial property, general commercial liability, workers’ compensation, and other products that provide broad protection against common risks faced by businesses in various sectors. Specialty line products are tailored to mitigate risks faced in specific industries, such as natural resources, marine, energy, fleet, real estate, and construction, as well as complex functional risks, including cyber, financial lines, professional indemnity, directors and officers. Specialty lines also include transactional lines, which are designed to mitigate risks in business transactions, particularly in mergers and acquisitions, with products such as warranty and indemnity insurance, tax liability insurance, litigation buyout insurance, and contingent liability insurance. ----- _Personal Lines Insurance_ The personal lines sector of the insurance market caters to individuals, providing a range of non-life insurance products. This includes general coverage options such as accident and health, household, motor, travel, and personal accident insurance. Additionally, the market also addresses the needs of niche segments or individuals with unique risk profiles through specialist non-life insurance products, which cater to specific interests or higher-value assets such as jewelry, art, and vintage cars. _Reinsurance_ Reinsurance products help insurance underwriters, including carriers and MGAs, by securing protection from another insurer. It is designed to redistribute risk, thereby assisting insurers in managing large-scale claim liabilities. It is primarily categorized into treaty reinsurance and facultative reinsurance. Treaty reinsurance involves comprehensive agreements covering a broad range of risks under long-term contracts, offering consistent risk management over extended periods. Facultative reinsurance is tailored to specific, individual risks, providing customized solutions through detailed underwriting on a case-by-case basis. _Advisory and Consulting Services_ Advisory and consulting services offer specialized expertise in employee benefits, mortgage products and capital market advisory. These services include comprehensive advice in real estate and mortgage advisory, as well as strategic advice in mergers and acquisitions, capital raising, and insurance-linked securities for insurance carriers and insurance service companies.

This entrepreneurial spirit and people-first approach have been instrumental in fostering a vibrant corporate culture. Out of a total workforce of approximately 15,500 individuals, about 4,500 employees are shareholders, and around 2,600 of them participate in equity incentive schemes. Together, they hold approximately one-third of the Group’s equity, establishing our workforce as the largest and most significant shareholder group.

From October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2023, we completed over 100 Bolt-on Acquisitions and Transformational Acquisitions, accounting for approximately £1,040 million of acquired revenue. The majority of these transactions are the result of bilateral negotiations, although we also selectively participate in competitive auctions. The majority of our M&A activity by volume focuses on small to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions that bolster our existing regional capabilities. From October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2023, our M&A approach resulted in the successful completion of 97 Bolt-on Acquisitions, with over 50% of these deals valued at less than £5 million whereas about 60% of acquired EBITDA comes from deals with multiples below 10x pricing EBITDA. See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” Source: Company information ----- Large strategic deals for transformative growth have been focused on expanding geographical footprint and product capabilities. For example, the acquisitions of A-Plan Group and Aston Lark expanded our personal lines offering and products for micro SME, SME and mid-sized corporates within the UK. The recent acquisition of Marsh R.S. strengthened our position in southern Spain and improved our capabilities to cover large corporates in Spain. The acquisition of Assiteca significantly increased our presence in Italy by adding a further 20 offices. The acquisition of Align has moved DUAL to one of the largest MGAs globally. The acquisition of TigerRisk strengthened our position in the global reinsurance market, placing us among the world’s top reinsurance brokers. It also complemented our offering of facultative reinsurance by adding treaty reinsurance and capital advisory capabilities in the U.S. and the UK. During the financial year ended September 30, 2023, we enhanced our treaty reinsurance offering and improved our footprint in the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Belgium and Denmark through strategic M&A activity. Acquired entities are integrated into the Group and generally rebranded to Howden to maximize the scale benefit and global coverage of our brand.

614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.25,Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data,9.25.1,,"_The following table sets forth our summary historical consolidated financial data as of the dates and for the periods indicated. On September 27, 2021, a new holding company, HGH Finance, was created and was subsequently inserted between HGH Limited and the operating subsidiaries of the Group on January 25, 2022 (the “HGH Finance Reorganization”). Therefore, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021, the financial statements of the Group were consolidated and reported at the level of HGH Limited. The summary historical consolidated financial data have been derived from the 2023 Financial Statements and the 2022 Financial Statements, which have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent auditors, and the 2021 Financial Statements, which have been audited by Deloitte LLP, our independent auditors for that period with the exception of certain line items of the HGH Limited Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended September 30, 2021 which are being presented on a restated basis. Such restated amounts have therefore been extracted from the unaudited comparative column in the HGH Limited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, such figures also being consistent with the equivalent figures in the 2022 Financial Statements. The restated Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended September 30, 2021 has not been audited by Deloitte LLP. The following tables also contain various measures and ratios that are not presented in accordance with IFRS (the “Non-IFRS Measures”). Such measures and ratios may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt, have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or (loss)/profit for the year or any other performance measures derived from or in accordance with US GAAP, IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our financial statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. The historical results included below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and should be read in conjunction with “Selected Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is important to our investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance within the insurance brokerage industry. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation of each of our operating units and for us as a whole. However, Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS, and should not be used as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA has its limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported in accordance with IFRS.

This adjustment relates to the add-back of EBITDA losses of these lateral hires incurred in the financial year during this growth phase and is calculated by investment.

(iv) Group-wide transformation projects relate to projects which add new significant capabilities or are transformational to the Group. Examples include the creation of global front end trading systems for both Howden and DUAL, implementation of global IT platforms and implementation of global IT security standards. (v) Non-current assets impairments related to the charges taken in respect of goodwill and intangible assets. (vi) The Covid-19 adjustment relates to all incremental costs and income directly attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic. This ranges from items such as government cash grants in certain non-UK jurisdictions, travel cancellations, setting up employees to work from home and making office spaces Covid-19 safe in line with local requirements. (vii) Employee service post-business combination relates to the continuing provision of services rendered by employees of acquired businesses, which are performed in order to earn deferred or contingent consideration for an acquisition, or to fulfil vesting requirements of Howden shares issued as consideration as part of an acquisition. (viii) Other items relate to onerous contracts and other items considered not to be run-rate in nature. (f) Acquisition costs, which relate to professional and other incremental costs directly attributable to acquisitions and disposals of businesses and minority interests.

(j) Adjustments relating to the unrealized portion of identifiable cost reduction savings programs currently undertaken and the expected benefit that would have been realized if they were in effect from the beginning of the year.

614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"Our business and results of operations depend on decisions and actions by insurance carriers and trends in the general insurance industry, which are beyond our control.","We are engaged in insurance brokerage and agency activities and derive revenue principally from commissions paid by insurance carriers. Historically, the results of companies in the insurance carrier industry have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The industry’s profitability, and therefore the profitability of our own business, may be affected significantly by competition and consolidation, capital availability, cyclicality, historical and expected loss experiences, and volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, climate-related and other natural catastrophes. The demand for our insurance products varies significantly, closely tracking the fluctuations in overall economic activity. As economic activity intensifies, we generally observe an increase in demand for insurance products, which conversely declines during periods of economic downturn. Furthermore, client demand is influenced by specific dynamics within a particular industry or client segment, over which we exert no control. There is no assurance that the insurance industry will effectively adapt to changing consumer needs by providing suitable product lines or maintaining adequate access to capacity. Should the industry fail to promptly respond to these evolving demands, there is a considerable risk that consumers may increasingly resort to self-insurance or alternative risk mitigation methods. Such shift would result in a reduced overall need for traditional insurance products, thereby reducing the number of submissions and commissions and, therefore, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also depend on the continued ability of insurance companies and other third parties to underwrite risk and provide coverage and capacity, which, in turn, is contingent on insurance carriers’ ability to procure reinsurance and therefore reinsurers’ ability to access capital. If the insurance companies we rely upon are unable to provide enough capacity for key risks, or if they fail to keep up with the fast changing risk environment, our clients may decide not to purchase these products or may forsake insurance entirely. For example, the demand and the scope of insurance products involving socio-political (war or terrorism coverage), climate (catastrophe coverage and energy transition risk), legal, and technology risks have changed frequently in the last years. As a result, we may not be able to procure the amount or type of coverage that our customers desire, or the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain lines of coverage that we offer to our clients, we could lose clients or be unable to place insurance coverage for certain risks for which we do not have alternative markets, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our relationships and agreements with insured clients, retail brokers, trading partners, including exclusive insurance carriers, are generally terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, our counterparties have the ability to amend the terms of the agreements. Insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new insurance products, limit our ability to distribute their products in certain geographies, amend our agreements with them to our detriment, or decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels. If any counterparty terminates or amends their relationship with us, we may lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new insurance carrier relationships. ----- Additionally, to the extent that reinsurance becomes scarce as a result of adverse economic conditions, consolidation or disintermediation, our commission rates and/or premiums may decline and may significantly affect our profitability. Similarly, retail brokers and other trading partners could develop their own wholesale distribution channels or choose to work with wholesale distributors other than us. This could reduce the number of submissions we receive which could result in reduced commissions and, therefore, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new relationships with retail brokers or other sources of business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business may be materially adversely affected.","We face competition in all markets in which we operate, primarily based on product breadth, innovation, quality of service, and price. Over the last several decades, large insurance brokerages, new private equitybacked brokerages, and publicly traded companies in the financial services industry have been acquiring small to medium-sized independent intermediaries to offer insurance products and services and to strengthen their market share. Some of these market participants may have greater resources than we do and, as a result, may identify and adapt to trends more quickly or withstand an economic downturn and/or declining premium rates better than we do. In certain markets we compete directly with locally owned insurance brokerages, many of which have existing relationships with insurance carriers. Since relationships between insurance brokerages and insurance carriers or customers are often local or regional in nature, we may be competitively disadvantaged in areas in which we do not have a significant local or regional presence. Various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets have also emerged and are likely to continue. These alternatives to traditional insurance include, among other things, greater levels of selfinsurance, captives (i.e., arrangements where the policyholder owns the insurance company), rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions. Some insurance carriers are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers on policies they sell directly. An increase in the use of alternative insurance markets may reduce our client base and, therefore, adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Recently, regulatory changes in the financial services industry have permitted, and may further permit, in the future, banks, securities firms, and insurance carriers to affiliate, causing increased consolidation in the insurance industry. If we are unable to compete effectively or if competition reduces the fees that we can obtain for our services, we will suffer a loss of market share, decreased revenues, and reduced operating margins, which in turn may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"We may experience unexpected fluctuations in our commission income because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and which historically have varied and are difficult to predict, and we are less able to forecast profit commissions related to our underwriting business than premium-based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.","Commissions related to our (re)insurance business are generally paid on the basis of a percentage of premiums paid by clients for insurance products. We have no control over the insurance premium rates on which these commissions are calculated. The amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on factors beyond our control. Premium rates may vary widely and are determined by insurance carriers based on a wide range of economic and specific market conditions. During the last 10 years, we have experienced a positive rating environment. During 2020, the net impact of rate and exposure had a moderately positive impact on our results. This trend continued with a moderately positive impact until the year ended September 30, 2023. Because we cannot determine the timing and the extent of premium rate changes, we may not be able to accurately forecast our commission income, including whether it will significantly decline. Any decline in ----- premiums or reduction in our commission rates may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenue. Our underwriting division, which is granted delegated authority by insurance companies to underwrite risks within a defined category of business on their behalf, earns a commission for its services, along with a profit commission which represents a share of underwriting profits when the risks underwritten perform at or better than an agreed loss ratio. Profit commissions are typically dependent upon the profitability of the business placed with the insurer. We are less able to forecast profit commissions than premium-based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings. As the profitability of our underwriting division is in part dependent upon the ratio of claims made to total underwriting business placed, catastrophic events, whether natural or otherwise, may affect the amount of claims being made and therefore the profitability of the business which we placed, and in turn may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.4,"Our business may be adversely affected by a challenging economic environment, inflation and geopolitical tensions.","Our revenue by location of end-insureds is almost evenly split across the UK, Europe and North America. As a result, we are particularly affected by economic developments and regulatory and political changes in the Western economies and markets globally. Economic difficulties, increased competition between insurers due to an economic downturn and other factors may prevent increases in premiums or may even cause the premium rates on which commissions are based to decline. In addition, any significant reduction or delay by customers in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Factors such as declining business and consumer confidence, cost of living crisis, lower household income and consumer spending, downturns in the property market and other economic challenges could have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of our commercial and individual customers. Insolvencies associated with continuing economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business through the loss of customers or by hindering our ability to place insurance. Due to their size, our small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) business customers may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn and may be more prone to insolvency than larger commercial customers. Global markets are also experiencing volatility and disruption as a result of global inflationary pressures and monetary policy tightening, the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, the recent events in the Middle East and the potential regional instability resulting from these events, and trade tensions between the United States and China. Capital markets have been and may continue to be impacted by inflation, which is currently the case in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and there are concerns that current inflationary pressures could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, increased foreign exchange volatility and decreased GDP in the markets in which we operate. In addition, there are concerns that these events could push the Eurozone, the UK and/or the United States into an economic recession, any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial markets. Any of the events described above may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any of the aforementioned factors, individually or in the aggregate, that negatively impact the insurance market, the economy, and the economic growth and stability of any of the jurisdictions we conduct our business in (including but not limited to the UK and the European Union) could increase our operating costs, impose additional regulatory burdens and may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverage that we offer our clients, overall underwriting capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance. This or any other negative economic developments in any of the jurisdictions we conduct our business in could reduce customer confidence or limit the demand for our insurance products and as a result may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.5,"We may be unsuccessful in identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition candidates or integrating acquired companies, which could impede our growth and ability to remain competitive in our industry.","Our strategic plan includes the regular and systematic evaluation and acquisition of companies in new and existing markets. Since our founding, we have partnered with and acquired firms with offices across 50 countries. We have sought and continue to seek individuals and companies that share our values and can seamlessly integrate into our Group, placing a strong emphasis on employee ownership. For example, our core broking business was expanded following the acquisition of A-Plan Group, one of the UK’s largest personal and commercial lines insurance brokers, thereby significantly broadening our retail distribution and specialist product capabilities in the UK and incorporating A-Plan Group’s best-in-class distribution model. We further expanded our broking business through the acquisition of Aston Lark, one of the UK’s largest independent insurance brokers specializing in complex commercial and private client insurance and employee benefit advice, which completed in April 2022. Further, our position in the (re)insurance market was strengthened following the acquisition of Align (one of the largest independent managing general agencies (“MGA”) in North America) in 2021, the acquisition of Assiteca (one of the largest insurance intermediaries in Italy) in 2022 as well as the acquisition of TigerRisk (the world’s fourth largest global reinsurance broker) in January 2023. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Prospective acquisition candidates may not become available or we may not be able to complete an acquisition once negotiations have commenced. We may also fail to secure the financial resources, including through third party financing, to complete prospective acquisitions. We sometimes compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have greater financial resources or are otherwise willing to pay more than we are and these entities may be able to outbid us for these acquisition targets. In addition, some of the acquisitions we may undertake in the future could substantially increase our size, either as a result of a single acquisition or multiple acquisitions. If the size of our Group increases due to current or future acquisitions, it may be difficult for us to properly integrate, manage and control each of our newly acquired divisions, branches and local projects, particularly in light of our decentralized structure. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and _Industry—Our decentralized organization may negatively affect our ability to implement and maintain our strategy, internal controls and more generally to carry out our business.”_ We also may fail to fully or timely integrate any acquired company into our Group. We completed 56 acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2023, and over 100 acquisitions since 2016, and have hired a large number of lateral employees as part of our growth strategy. We have not yet completed integration efforts for all of these acquisitions and we may be unable to successfully integrate all of our recently acquired intermediaries or any insurance intermediaries that we may acquire in the future. The acquisition or integration of such acquisition involves a number of factors that may affect our operations. These factors include, but are not limited to: - distraction of management; - incurrence of significant amounts of additional debt; - tax and accounting issues, including the creation of significant future contingent liabilities relating to earn outs for acquisitions or other financial liabilities; - difficulties in the integration of acquired operations (which may include implementing or remediating controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company, integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, information technology and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions, transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms) and retention of key personnel; - the degree to which the acquired company’s business is different from that of our core insurance intermediary business and the degree to which we understand and master the practices (including, without limitation to, the accounting practices) of non-intermediary businesses; and - unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and/or new legal or compliance obligations. Our continued growth is partly based on our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and our failure to do so may cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, ----- incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally, which in turn may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.6,"Launching new business initiatives and expanding into new business lines may expose us to new challenges and more risks, and we may not achieve the expected results.","Our growth strategy involves a number of new business initiatives which serve to diversify our offering. These include, among others, launching new business ventures, such as Howden Ventures, a world-first insurance innovation hub with £500 million of delegated underwriting capacity. We also have recently expanded our catastrophe bond practice, as we now also act as initial purchasers in catastrophe bonds offerings. Additionally, from time to time, we seek selected opportunities to use the Group’s resources to support our underwriting capabilities. For instance, in 2020 we created Catalyst Capacity Vehicle, a vehicle we used until 2022 to support a specific retrocession binding authority agreement for Tamesis, a global specialty excess of loss treaty reinsurance business part of DUAL. Our lack of familiarity or experience with these and any future new businesses may make it more difficult for us to anticipate client demand and preferences, and we may encounter significant competition in business areas where we are less established. We may not be successful in the introduction, marketing or development of any new business initiatives and they may not perform in line with expectations. Our new business initiatives may also expose us to additional and new risks. For example, since we recently started acting as initial purchasers in catastrophe bonds offerings, we are now exposed to the remote risk that, if on the settlement date of a catastrophe bond where we have acted as initial purchaser, an investor fails to pay any amount due in connection with their investment, our Group may be required to buy out such investor’s position. We cannot guarantee that these and any future new ventures will ultimately prove successful or will not generate significant losses. Failure to successfully manage a new business initiative may adversely impact our brand image and reputation and negatively affect our existing business lines and the launch of future initiatives and, therefore, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, regardless of the revenue that we may derive from them, these and any future initiatives will require financial investments and will involve significant diversions of management’s time and attention, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our Business and Industry,13.1.7,"Our decentralized organization may negatively affect our ability to implement and maintain our strategy, internal controls and more generally to carry out our business.","We believe that our decentralized organizational structure in which our divisions and their managers retain substantial autonomy is a key element of our business model and an important element in maintaining our competitive position. However, this structure could cause difficulties in bringing the controls, accounting procedures and policies of the companies of our Group and the companies we acquire up to the standard of our Group’s controls and procedures in a timely manner, which could lead to inadvertent breaches of our existing policies as well as to inaccuracies or misstatements in our financial reporting. While we have adopted certain policies and rules that are applicable to each entity of our Group, we may not be able to efficiently monitor and enforce the compliance of each local team with such policies and rules. As decentralization necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of each division of our Group and on their local business and branch managers, there is a risk that those local managers will not comply with our internal policies or processes, or that we will not successfully implement future compliance policies. Any failure to properly implement our internal policies and processes may cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our decentralized structure and acquisitive nature may also increase the risk of errors or malicious or fraudulent activity or delay our knowledge of potential errors or malicious or fraudulent activity. While a well-designed, operated, and tested control system may provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, our internal controls and procedures may not identify all errors or prevent certain ----- malicious or fraudulent activity and our knowledge of potential errors or malicious or fraudulent activity may be delayed. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of a control, or may become inadequate over time. Because of these inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected, which may result in liabilities or reputational damages and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our decentralized structure may cause difficulties in our awareness and responsiveness to adverse operating or financial developments at our insurance intermediaries. To implement and monitor our business plan and determine and report our operating results, we depend on timely and accurate reporting of business conditions, including legal, regulatory, and financial results, from our businesses. We have internal controls and communication procedures in place to receive ongoing communications from management as well as formal monthly and quarterly reporting from each of our businesses regarding their financial condition and operating results, and overall business conditions, including legal and regulatory compliance. However, if an adverse business or financial development occurs at one or more of our businesses, or if one or more of our businesses were to report inaccurate financial information, we may not become aware of the occurrence in a timely manner, which could make it more difficult for us to effectively respond to that development and could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our exposure and determine and report our financial results. There is also a risk that each division of our Group, and particularly newly acquired Group companies, may not swiftly implement or maintain efficient, reliable IT systems, or that newly acquired companies are not fully integrated within our Group’s IT infrastructure. Moreover, this structure may negatively affect or delay our ability to move cash within our Group and, therefore, comply with our financial obligations, including paying any amount due under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.","We have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods but there is no certainty that we will be able to sustain such revenue growth. Our growth strategy focuses on driving organic growth and executing our growth initiatives. We believe that our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to: - execute our acquisition strategy and adequately expand, train, integrate and retain our insurance and reinsurance brokers and underwriters; - attract new talent and adequately train, integrate and retain new employees, and maintain or increase our sales force’s productivity; - sell insurers products effectively so that we are able to attract and retain clients without compromising our profitability; - attract new clients, successfully deploy and implement our products, obtain client renewals, provide our clients with excellent client support and implement cross-selling initiatives within our existing client base; - increase our network of insurer trading partners and maintain the ongoing dialogue with our network of insurance carriers; - enhance our information, training and communication systems to ensure that our employees are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and clients; - improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of our operational and financial results; - successfully create new distribution channels; - successfully introduce new products and enhance existing products; - successfully introduce our products to new markets inside and outside of the UK; ----- - successfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants; and - increase awareness of our brand. We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives, and as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. Our historical growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future performance and may decline in the future. In future periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than in recent periods or decline for any number of reasons, including those outlined above. In addition, the additional expenses we will incur may not lead to sufficient additional revenue to maintain historical revenue growth rates and profitability. If our revenue growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In particular, our acquisition strategy includes a disciplined approach to evaluating opportunities and integrating acquisitions and the use of contingent payments, or “earn outs” and equity incentive schemes to incentivize the acquired company’s management teams, encourage retention of key employees and further align interests. Our future growth depends, in large part, on our ability to successfully implement these strategies. If we fail to successfully implement these strategies, if new regulations impact their efficacy or if any of these strategies ultimately proves unsuccessful, we may not be able to compete effectively or achieve and maintain profitability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, companies that we have acquired may not be as profitable as we expected them to be. Since our founding in 1994, we have partnered with and acquired businesses with offices across 50 countries and have hired a large number of employees through lateral hiring as part of our growth strategy. Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of each of the companies we acquire, we may not have identified all material facts and risks concerning these companies. Unanticipated events or liabilities relating to these companies may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, once we have integrated an acquired company, it may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or productivity comparable to our existing locations, or otherwise perform as expected. In addition, the companies we acquire may not provide a sufficient level of client service and satisfaction, which may negatively affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The (re)insurance brokerage industry continues to experience intense competition for the services of leading individual producers and brokerage teams. We are and may be subject to a number of claims or proceedings that arise as a result of recruitment practices focused on attracting key talent. While such practices are common in our industry, these claims, regardless of merit, may ultimately result in financial liability for our Group. For example, on October 10, 2023, HGH Limited (and certain other companies in our Group) and Guy Carpenter & Company Limited (and certain other companies within the Guy Carpenter/Marsh McLennan Group, (the reinsurance broking arm of Marsh McLennan Companies, Inc.)) reached an agreement for settlement in the amount of £56.5 million (inclusive of Guy Carpenter’s costs) in respect of claims commenced by Guy Carpenter against the Group in the High Court of England and Wales. The claims related to alleged breach of employment obligations (including post termination restrictive covenants) within the employment ----- and other agreements of 37 individual reinsurance brokers who ceased employment with Guy Carpenter and were recruited and employed by our Group. An adverse outcome or the cost of any settlement in connection with one or more of these matters may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier, client or employee relationships, or divert personnel and management resources. The number of claims, actions and other proceedings arising as a result of our recruitment strategy (whether meritorious or not) may increase in the future, and thus we expect to be required to devote more resources to managing such claims and challenges in the future. Conversely, if key personnel were to end their employment with us, or if we experience significant turnover, it could negatively affect the execution of our business strategy, disrupt the relationships with our clients and/or insurance carriers, and our operations could be adversely affected until suitable replacements with appropriate experience can be found. In particular, if we fail to retain key personnel of our newly acquired companies, the value of those acquisitions itself could be materially affected and we may be unable to fully realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our equity ownership model is a key part of our proposition to retain existing and new employees. Should our equity ownership model cease to be attractive for any reason, including a change in the tax or fiscal treatment of shares or a decrease in share prices, it may have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and, therefore, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We are at risk of attack by a growing list of threat actors through increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. Because the techniques used to infiltrate or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. While we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions and some entities hold certifications for meeting certain security standards, we have been exposed in the past, and may be exposed in the future, to cyber incidents. For instance, in October 2023, three of the Group’s electronic platforms providing various services to brokers and the market were attacked and unavailable for a short time, causing some limited disruption. The Cyber response plan was activated and regulators notified as appropriate. If we are unable to maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access or be subject to security breaches, which could in turn cause extended disruptions in the functioning of our information technology systems, unexpected costs, thus damaging our reputation, causing us to lose clients and adversely impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite the various measures we have implemented to safeguard systems and data and to mitigate the impact of loss were it to occur, were a successful attack to occur, our information could be encrypted or otherwise unavailable to us. While we select our service providers and our third party vendors carefully, cyberattacks and security breaches at a client or vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business and could put our systems at risk.

The insurance and insurance intermediary industries have been subject to a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory and governmental bodies concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include, without limitation, the receipt of supplemental and contingent commissions by insurance brokers and agents from insurance companies and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the collection of broker fees, which we define as fees separate from commissions charged directly to clients for efforts performed in the issuance of new insurance policies and related matters. The approach taken by regulators regarding streams of income, such as commission income, may change from time to time and, notwithstanding the diversification of the business overall, this may adversely impact the reliability of income streams. We are subject to laws regarding money laundering, financing of terrorism and laws prohibiting us, our employees or intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments ----- and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, across the jurisdictions we conduct our business in. This is includes, without limitation and by way of example, the UK’s Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the UK Bribery Act, The Fourth and Fifth European Union Anti-Money Laundering Directives. We also may be subject to sanctions administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, the UK National Crime Agency, or other relevant sanctions authorities. The scope, sophistication and nature of the anti-corruption laws, regulation and levels of enforcement may vary significantly among the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. As a result of our growing international presence, we may become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities. Failure to comply with any such laws could result in investigations, public censure, financial penalties, and liability and/or enforcement actions being brought against us. Additionally, any developments or changes in laws and regulations (including due to changes in fiscal policies and in the political framework in any of the jurisdictions we conduct our business in) could impair our ability to conduct our business or make our business model less attractive, and thus could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Firms in our industry must maintain regulatory authorizations in most, if not all, the jurisdictions we conduct business. Some of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, such as the UK, have an extensive set of rules that apply to our business, while in other jurisdictions the relevant regulators are or are planning to implement similar regimes. Our insurance intermediary activities must comply with prudential rules and guidelines in each relevant jurisdiction, which impose or may impose in the future, amongst other things, a high-level standard on the establishment and maintenance of proper systems and controls and minimum threshold conditions that must be satisfied for an insurance intermediary firm to remain authorized as well as rules on the conduct of business and treating customers fairly. For instance, in the UK, these rules impose minimum “threshold conditions” that must be satisfied as well as robust standards for the establishment and maintenance of proper systems and controls, notably for the conduct of business and the fair treatment of customers. These rules also impose upon us certain minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Our conduct obligations require us to demonstrate that we are consistently delivering fair outcomes to consumers and that senior management is taking responsibility for ensuring that we, and our employees at all levels, deliver the consumer outcomes relevant to our business by establishing an appropriate culture. Such rules oblige us to proactively identify and manage conflicts of interest fairly and we risk regulatory action if we do not do so. Furthermore, we often incur additional costs in order to comply with changes to the regulatory landscape. There is no assurance that we will continue to be able to fund such costs or that the incurrence of such costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similar sets of rules already exist or may be implemented in the future in the other jurisdictions we conduct our business in, such as Ireland, Australia and in Asia. Firms have an ongoing obligation to periodically provide regulators in each of the jurisdictions they operate in with certain information, such as their financial performance and customer outcomes. Regulators supervise firms’ activities to assess compliance with regulatory requirements, including client money rules. Regulators will seek additional information from firms via surveys, thematic reviews and formal risk assessments. Certain regulators have extensive investigative and disciplinary powers, including the power to impose fines and vary or cancel regulatory authorizations. While in the ordinary course of business we maintain an ongoing dialogue ----- with regulators across the jurisdictions where we operate, and while we endeavor a high standard of compliance, failure to comply with the rules and regulations imposed upon us may lead to disciplinary action, including requiring customers to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties or the partial or total revocation or variation of our authorizations to conduct business. In addition, individuals performing various controlled functions for regulated firms in some jurisdictions are required to be approved persons and to satisfy certain fitness and propriety criteria. Any disciplinary or enforcement action against these individuals by any regulator in any of the jurisdictions we conduct our business in, could prevent such persons from continuing to work for us. If these individuals are key personnel, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disciplinary or enforcement action against any individuals or against the business generally could result in damage to our brands and reputation which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We can also be affected indirectly by governmental regulation and the supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing our managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our clients. Future changes in laws and regulations relating to our business, as well as any regulatory intervention or investigation with respect to our business or the industry more generally, could limit future activities and result in increased costs of regulatory compliance and increased management attention being required to be dedicated to compliance. The focus of regulatory attention may change, develop into new and different areas, or further deepen the areas already subject to regulatory attention, thereby necessitating a change in our business lines or business model. For example, changes in the area of anti-trust enforcement could impact our acquisition strategy or subject us to various acquisition-related legal investigations or proceedings. This may consequently result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Regulation.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from commissions negotiated with, and paid for by, insurance carriers. This type of revenue has recently been subject to enhanced scrutiny by various regulators with respect to conflict of interest, anti-trust and unfair competition, in particular as our market share increases in certain jurisdictions, notably in the US, conduct and anti-bribery laws and regulations. For example, in 2021, the FCA has completed a market study into how general insurance firms charge their retail customers for home and motor insurance (the “FCA Market Study”). Based on the FCA Market Study, the FCA has introduced changes to the regulatory regime and provided, amongst other things, market-wide restrictions on renewal pricing exceeding the equivalent new business price, additional reporting requirements and an enhanced framework for the assessment of fair value. Some of the potential market scenarios that could emerge from the FCA Market Study and any similar findings by other regulators could have a significant impact on renewal profitability which, in the short term, may lead to a decrease in overall margins per policy. In May 2021, the FCA launched a consultation, “CP21/13: A new Consumer Duty,” on changes to its handbook of rules and guidance to set a higher level of protection for consumers in retail financial markets. The Consumer Duty imposes greater expectations on firms as regards consumer outcomes. The Consumer Duty is comprised of a ‘Consumer Principle’ that reflects the overall standards of behavior expected from firms, along with a set of rules and guidance which intended to amplify the Consumer Principle and which set out the detail of the FCA’s expectations for firms providing services to retail clients. The Consumer Principle sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to consumers. The rules for new and existing products came into force on July 31, 2023 and have been a key area of focus for the FCA in subsequent months. Although the rules and guidance are helpful, as with all new outcome-based regulatory frameworks, decisions of the regulators also play an integral part in interpretation of the same and there are, as yet, very few examples to draw on. ----- The theme of consumer-focused regulation being introduced by local regulators is a global risk for our Group, due to the nature of the highly regulated services being provided across numerous jurisdictions. Our Group monitors the risk this could pose to any of its existing business lines; however, it is likely that consumerfocused regulation will evolve and may diverge across these jurisdictions in future. To the extent the FCA or any other regulator adopts rules that reduce or eliminate the commissions payments we are able to receive from insurance carriers, our revenue could be reduced which, in turn, would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

To accommodate firms during the transition period, the FCA introduced a Temporary Permissions Regime which ended on December 30, 2023. From May 1, 2021, the relations between the European Union and the UK have been governed by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”). The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not create a detailed framework to govern the cross border provision of regulated financial services from the UK into the European Union and from the European Union into the UK.

Following the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, we provide our broking and underwriting services through entities that are authorized and regulated in the European Union, including through entities based in Luxembourg. Our continued ability to provide services through entities based in the European Union depends on the criteria set forth by the relevant regulators, which include establishing a presence in those jurisdictions. Establishing presence and substance in the relevant jurisdictions is an ongoing process, requiring a significant investment of resources. For instance, the relevant regulators may require that we hire senior employees with particular skill-set and experience or that we maintain a minimum headcount in each relevant jurisdiction. Additionally, the relevant regulators may change the requirements for us to conduct business in the European Union jurisdictions at any time. From time to time, we may receive enquiries from regulators with respect to our passporting and other arrangements.

This includes compulsory reporting requirements and, in some jurisdictions, a commitment to move towards net zero operating models. Significant changes to the way in which businesses operate could impact the operations of our Group and our clients.","There has been increased focus by customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well as by governmental organizations and regulators on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. ----- Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are increasingly focusing on ESG issues and implementing policies and regulations to address them, including by expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability, natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital and risk oversight. For example, companies across all industries have been subject to increasing ESG reporting requirements, such as the new requirements under the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (EU Directive 2022/2464), which will come into force in the European Union in 2024. While we have been making statements about our ESG goals and initiatives since the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 through our reporting under the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework(including through periodic sustainability reports and information provided on our website and in our press releases and other communications), compliance with these regulations could require significant changes to our business practices, operations, and investments. There can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will meet ESG expectations or any current or future ESG reporting requirements that are continuously evolving. In particular, we may not be able to efficiently collect and report data from each of the companies of our Group and, therefore, we may not be able to comply in a timely manner with any present or future ESG reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant financial penalties, legal liabilities, and reputational damage, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, changes in regulations, laws, and policies around ESG factors and negative perceptions and media attention regarding the activities of some of our clients could have an adverse impact on the operations of our Group and our clients, as well as expose us to legal and financial risks, and thus may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Our Existing Facilities bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or SOFR (LIBOR historically), as applicable, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates have recently risen in response to higher inflation and could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. As for September 30, 2023, our Group estimates that, through the combination of the natural hedge and interest rate derivatives (swaps and cap), a weighted average of 67% (2022: 61%, 2021: 36%) of the notional amount of the Existing Term Loans is hedged for the period to March 2024. In the future, we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges, on terms that are acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us to interest rate risk. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform. Some of these reforms are already effective, while others are still being implemented. These benchmark reforms include the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (Regulation 2016/1011/EU), which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. As a further example of the ongoing benchmark reforms, on March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or the potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an ----- adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark.

This exposure arises where revenue is received in currencies different from the currency of our costs. A significant amount of our revenue is denominated in GBP, USD and EUR. However, the majority of our costs are denominated in GBP, despite diverse currency exposures. Further, our debt service obligations are in USD and EUR, serviced by respective USD and EUR profits. While there is a hedging program to buy GBP-sell USD to give some certainty over cash flows, the USD and EUR profits are largely unhedged to act as economic hedge over our Group’s debt leverage given our Group’s debt is largely in USD or EUR. Therefore if the USD/EUR debt fluctuates in value in GBP due to foreign exchange, there is a compensating movement in the USD/EUR profits to maintain leverage. Moreover, sharp spikes in USD vs. GBP at a month end can cause leverage to increase as the USD debt is revalued higher (at the spot rate) without a corresponding adjustment in EBITDA, as EBITDA is calculated on a 12 month average basis, all of which may cause positive or negative fluctuations to the leverage ratio. As a consequence, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations and any unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates, including as a result of the devaluation of a currency in a particular country we operate in, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Currency Fluctuations and Hedging.”_ Furthermore, we present our consolidated financial statements in GBP. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all operations that use a functional currency other than GBP. We translate into GBP at then-applicable exchange rates, exposing us to translation risk (i.e., the risk that exchange rates will impact the value of our income, assets, liabilities and expenses reported in GBP even if the value has not changed in the underlying currency). Currency translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and could result in significant changes to the carrying value of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

As of September 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our Total Debt would be in the amount of £5,603 million (equivalent), including $1,250 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes, $3,435 million in aggregate principal amount under the New Dollar Term Loan, €660 million in aggregate principal amount under the New Euro Term Loan and $1,083 under the 2030 Dollar Term Loan, and excluding up to £630 million available for drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Senior Notes.” Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Indentures do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our current or future leverage could prevent us from generating sufficient cash to pay the principal, interest or any other amounts that become due and payable under our ----- indebtedness, including the Notes. The terms of the Indentures and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will permit, under certain circumstances, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness by the Group and the proceeds from such indebtedness may be used, among others, to finance shareholder dividends reducing our liquidity while increasing our leverage. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations including, but not limited to: - result in our inability to maintain one or more of the financial ratios under our debt agreements, which could trigger the early maturity of part or all our debt; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower leverage and better access to third-party financing sources; - increase the costs of current and future loans; - limit our capacity to access new debt and promote necessary investment, or our ability to withstand adverse market conditions; or - force us to increase our capital stock or to divest specific strategic assets to service our debts or comply with the commitments under such debts. Pro forma for the Transactions, most of the principal amount of our financial debt will fall due in 2031 as a single payment upon the maturity of the Senior Secured Notes and the New Term Loan Facilities and there can be no assurance that we will at such time be able to refinance or otherwise repay such principal amount in full, and therefore holders of the Notes are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise the financing that we require.

Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks and in capital markets and our general financial performance. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on satisfactory terms and conditions as certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional debt.

As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such other secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such other indebtedness. While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among others, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.

As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, who will, subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, provide instructions to the Notes Collateral Agent in respect of the Collateral. By accepting a Senior Secured Note you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, ----- holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Senior Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law (see also “—The rights of _holders of the Senior Secured Notes in some of the Collateral may be adversely affected by such security interests being second-ranking”). The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the_ realization of security interests in collateral. The Notes Collateral Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. The Notes Collateral Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be affected or governed, as applicable, by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, as applicable, to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken (see also “—The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes in _some of the Collateral may be adversely affected by such security interests being second-ranking”). For example,_ in certain circumstances, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There might be some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides for the creation of “parallel debt”obligations in favor of the relevant Notes Collateral Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of each Issuer and Guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Notes Collateral Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Notes Collateral Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Notes Collateral Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are deemed not to have been validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

The applicable hardening ----- period will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, extended or recreated, including those security interests created on a subsequent date pursuant to an undertaking or promise to create the relevant security interest by the relevant mortgagor or pledgor. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future debt may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise restart or reopen hardening periods in certain or all of the jurisdictions of the SSN Guarantors or security providers, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. If the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the applicable hardening period, the security interest may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it under certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements. If the provider of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the relevant collateral grant date, any security interest in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the security provider or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Senior Secured Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Furthermore, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the Collateral may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain “permitted reorganizations.” In certain jurisdictions such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described herein. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security for the _Notes.”_ For a summary on hardening periods and actions for rescission in the jurisdictions of the SSN Guarantors or security providers in force as at the date of this Offering Memorandum see “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with_ respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the Bank Collateral Agent until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date. At any time that the Bank Collateral Agent does not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral. If we have, at such time, outstanding indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes and has a greater outstanding principal amount than the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, then the authorized representative for such indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the ----- Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. Also, under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Senior Secured Notes obtain possession of any part of the Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first priority obligations.

As such, in certain circumstances, the Collateral may be second-ranking in a particular jurisdiction and only be deemed and treated as security interests ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the obligations pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement pursuant to the application of the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. If the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were avoided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, holders of the Senior Secured Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and be subordinated, with respect to such security interests, to senior security interests over the same Collateral securing the obligations pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Under the U.S. bankruptcy code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or which could be materially delayed). Moreover, the U.S. bankruptcy code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents and profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. bankruptcy code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the Senior Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings or any other relevant time, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” ----- Furthermore, a bankruptcy court may decide to substantively consolidate us and some or all of our subsidiaries in a bankruptcy proceeding. If a bankruptcy court substantively consolidated us and some or all of our subsidiaries, the assets of each entity would become subject to the claims of creditors of all entities. Such a ruling would expose holders of the Senior Secured Notes not only to the usual impairments arising from bankruptcy, but also to potential dilution of the amount ultimately recoverable because of the larger creditor base. Furthermore, a forced restructuring of the notes could occur through the “cramdown” provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Under those provisions, the Senior Secured Notes could be restructured over holders’ objections as to their interest rates, maturities and other general terms. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances or which could be materially delayed). In addition, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will impose certain limitations on the ability of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing unless the authorized agent for the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement opposes or objects thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Upon a_ finding by the bankruptcy court that the Senior Secured Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured “deficiency”claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Senior Secured Notes to receive “adequate protection” under the U.S. bankruptcy code, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The laws of these states or jurisdictions may limit the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to foreclose on the real property Collateral located in any of these states or jurisdictions. Applicable laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure that are different from and that require a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it is has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and “one form of action”rules which can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of the location of the Collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Collateral Agent may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the lien covenant that will be set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens.” Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt_ secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the notes by reason of a breach of such covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to enforce the covenant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

These assets will also secure our and such guarantors’ indebtedness pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the Notes Collateral Agent. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these security interests. Our obligation to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in specified Collateral is limited and neither the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for the notes nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any duty to take any actions to perfect the security interests. To the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is not properly perfected, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. In connection with any Collateral located in the United States, if additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become SSN Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such SSN Guarantors. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Depending on the type of the assets constituting such collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, or that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such collateral. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor perfection or take any actions to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest. Similarly, the Bank Collateral Agent will have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein. Any failure to monitor may result in the loss of the security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Senior ----- Secured Notes and the SNN Guarantees against third parties.

As a result, the enforcement of a share pledge governed by the laws of such jurisdictions typically requires the sale of the relevant Collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public or notarial auction or other similar procedures. No assurance can be given that any such disposal process would be successful and any such steps may result in substantial waiting periods, notice requirements, legal costs and expenses that may not be recoverable from the SSN Issuers or through the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil _Liabilities,” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In addition, upon the foreclosure of a share pledge where not all the share capital is pledged, the remaining shareholders and the company may have pre-emption rights under the laws of certain jurisdictions (although not under English law, as explained below) in the case of private limited liability companies or as set out in the bylaws of the company in the case of both private and public limited liability companies, where applicable, over the shares that are being foreclosed. This may delay the enforcement process or affect the value of the shares. Under English law, the collateral taker may be able to exercise rights of appropriation with respect to financial collateral within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), which, notably, includes unlisted shares in private companies (unlike many other jurisdictions which have adopted Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements).

Until the senior ranking debt of such SUN Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled shall be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such SUN Guarantor as their interests may appear.

If, for whatever reason, such payments are not sufficient, for example, in the event that any withholding taxes are imposed, or otherwise deducted by the relevant borrower, in respect of any payments, the Issuers may not have other sources of funds available to them such that would permit them to make payments pursuant to the relevant Notes and will be dependent upon the cash flow from the Group in the form of intercompany loans or other distributions or payments to make payments pursuant to the Notes. In addition, HGH Finance and HGH Midco 3 Limited, which are the direct parent companies of the SUN Issuers and the SSN Issuers, respectively, are holding companies and have no revenue-generating operations of their own and no material assets other than the equity interests in their respective subsidiaries. Therefore, their ability to make direct or indirect payments or other distributions to the Issuers will be subject to the availability of profits or funds for such purpose which, in turn, will depend on the future performance of the Group which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative (including with respect to taxation), regulatory and other factors that may be beyond their control, and on the ability of the relevant Group companies to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to HGH Finance and HGH Midco 3 Limited. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may be or become subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions to their respective parent companies (including HGH Finance and HGH Midco 3 Limited) or the Issuers pursuant to their financing arrangements, and such financing arrangements may actually prohibit the ability of these subsidiaries to otherwise move cash within the restricted group. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient profits or cash flow from operations or that alternative sources of financing will be available at any time in an amount sufficient to enable these subsidiaries to service their indebtedness and to fund their other liquidity needs and also make payments to the Issuers to allow the Issuers to meet all payment obligations under the Notes. In such circumstances, holders of either series of Notes would have to rely upon their respective claims for payment under the relevant Guarantees and, as applicable, enforcement of the security interest over the Collateral, which are subject to the risks and limitations described herein. See also “—The Guarantees of the _Notes and the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_ In addition, financial assistance or corporate benefit restrictions may further prevent upstream loans, dividends or other distributions being made, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Guarantors by the Group subsidiaries to enable them to service their respective obligations to the Issuers, as applicable, and the Issuers to service their respective obligations under the Notes (or the Guarantors under the relevant Guarantees, as applicable). In particular, the ability of the Group subsidiaries to pay dividends will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their debt when due. Although the Indentures limit the ability of the Group subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuers and the Guarantors, there are significant ----- qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. For instance, goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our profit or loss account, as well as charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could potentially reduce our subsidiaries’ reserves available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments directly or indirectly to the Issuers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Relating to the Notes,13.4.2,The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness or obligations of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.,"Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the future liabilities of the Group subsidiaries (other than the SSN Issuers or the SUN Issuers, as the case may be) that are not, or do not become, Guarantors and to the liabilities of any Guarantor to the extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of the relevant series of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantor. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Group, including the Post-Closing Guarantors prior to the granting of the Post-Closing Guarantees, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuers or any Guarantor, as the case may be. Accordingly, in the event that any nonGuarantor subsidiary, including the Post-Closing Guarantors prior to the granting of the Post-Closing Guarantees, becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuers or any Guarantor, as the case may be, including the holders of the Notes, will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and - creditors of such subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. Based on the relevant calculation method in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we estimate that the Guarantors accounted for approximately 70% of our EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, non-Guarantor subsidiaries had £107 million of third-party debt outstanding, none of which was secured over the Collateral, and £180.9 million of lease liabilities. In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will share the Guarantees with lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the Indentures will, subject to certain limitations, permit the Issuers, HGH Finance and their respective subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indentures, and such indebtedness may also be secured. See “—Our substantial leverage and significant _debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.” The lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement have the discretion to_ release any guarantors in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes and the liens on the Collateral in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to automatically be released. While any obligations pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remain outstanding, any Guarantee of the Notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes, the Senior Notes Trustee or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, as applicable, under the Indentures, at the discretion of lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, if the relevant Guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or any other indebtedness (other than in connection with a repayment in full of the New Credit Facilities or Refinanced Facilities). See “Description of the Senior Notes,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Other _Indebtedness.” The lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement have the discretion to release_ guarantees in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of the holders of the Notes. In addition, in connection with the Senior Secured Notes, the liens on the assets of any such subsidiary that is released as a guarantor will automatically be released without the consent of any holder of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” If one_ or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or security interest depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor or of the Collateral against any security provider. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations under its Guarantee or security interest, (ii) direct that the holders of the relevant series of Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee or security interest was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee or security interest has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when the relevant Guarantee or security interest was given; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee or security interest was held to exceed the corporate objectives of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or security interest was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; or - the amount of the Guarantee or security interest would exceed the amount of distributable funds available for distribution to the shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or security interest granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indentures, as applicable. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security ----- provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee or security interest was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee or security interest, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the relevant Issuer and of any other Guarantor or security provider under the relevant Guarantee or security interest which has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee or security interest obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

In the event that the Issuers, the Guarantors, any third-party security providers or any other subsidiaries of HGH Finance experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.

There is no assurance that such credit ratings will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in the applicable rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect our ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which we are able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. Our credit rating may be impacted by a number of factors, including the effects of the economic conditions in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future and any future rating downgrades of the sovereign debt of these countries, as well as changes in the legal framework or taxation applicable to our activities. Any adverse developments with respect to our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We serve clients all over the world with over $38 billion in gross written premiums placed as of September 30, 2023, combining the capabilities of a global brokerage firm with the personalized values of an employee-owned business supported by long term, growth oriented financial partners. Our global headquarters are in London, United Kingdom, and we have offices in more than 50 countries across Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, the United States and Latin America, combined with a network of partners which enables us to cover over 100 countries and territories globally. We believe that we are one of the few players with an operating model that combines a global platform with strong local presence. Our personal, service-oriented approach, delivered through our office network, branches and digital and online channels, and backed-up by data and analytics, has led to high levels of client satisfaction, driving high retention rates and strong organic growth. In addition to the strong organic growth, we expanded our global network through a selective and disciplined acquisition program investing in likeminded, entrepreneurial insurance businesses. The successful execution of our combined organic growth and acquisition strategy has led to sustained and significant growth. We generated IFRS Revenue of £2,350.6 million, Adjusted Revenue of £2,442.8 million, Loss after tax of £328.8 million, and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of £780.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with IFRS Revenue of £1,630.4 million, Adjusted Revenue of £1,841.2 million, Loss after tax of £92.1 million, and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of £598.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.

Our commission income is generally based on insurance premiums and negotiated commission rates, and fees are paid for claims administration or other individual services based on negotiated amounts. We derive a small portion of our commission income from profit commission agreements with our insurers. Profit commissions are typically dependent upon the underwriting profitability of the business placed with the insurer, which is a function of premiums earned less commission paid, claims costs, insurer expenses and the target financial returns for the insurer. We are less able to forecast profit commissions than premium based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings. Furthermore, ----- catastrophic events, whether natural or otherwise, can have a significant effect on the number and value of claims being made, and therefore a significant effect on the profitability of the business we place with the insurance company. Changes in profit commissions are largely attributable to economic and market conditions that are outside of our control and that affect premium prices and lead to increases or decreases in overall claims. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We may experience unexpected fluctuations in _our commission income because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and which historically have varied and are difficult to predict, and we are less able to forecast profit commissions related to our underwriting business than premium-based commissions due to the link with variable insurance events and the inherent volatility this brings, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting results of operations,17.2.2,Acquisitions,"Our results of operations during the periods under review have been affected by certain acquisitions which may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate the historical performance of our business by comparing period over period results. Some of our material acquisitions for the three-year period ended September 30, 2023 include the acquisition of A-Plan during the year ended September 30, 2021, Align, Aston Lark and Assiteca during the year ended September 30, 2022 and TigerRisk and March R.S. during the year ended September 30, 2023. See “—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results” below for an explanation of how acquisitions during the periods under review have affected the comparability of our results across these periods. Acquisitions impact our financial position and results of operations in a variety of ways. First, our consolidated results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business. As acquired businesses are included in our consolidation perimeter from the date of completion of each relevant acquisition, their full impact is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred is measured as the fair value of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group at the date of exchange. Any costs directly attributable to the business combination are booked to the income statement as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Subsequent changes in the fair value of consideration transferred or identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are adjusted where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with the applicable IFRS. For some acquisitions, we have structured acquisitions to include contingent payments, or “earnouts,” to the acquired company’s management team to incentivize them and encourage retention of key employees. These earnouts are generally contingent on maintaining or achieving specified revenue, earnings or other financial performance measures in future periods and range in duration but typically up to three years after the completion date of the acquisition. Other measures to incentivize both growth and retention of key employees in acquisitions are equity incentive schemes put in place post-completion and typically are four or five years in duration. Finally, equity in the form of Howden Group shares issued as consideration to the acquired company’s management forms another key retention strategy given the shares are relatively illiquid and have strict leaver provisions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting results of operations,17.2.3,Insurance Cycle,"The general insurance cycle is an insurance market phenomenon that is driven by supply of and demand for insurance and can be particularly pronounced in reinsurance and industrial lines insurance. The insurance market cycle is defined as “softening”and “hardening.”“Soft”periods are characterized by falling or stagnant premium rates and are driven normally by excessive supply of capital from insurance companies and other ----- market participants competing for available business. Soft markets on average result in low profitability for the insurers and as a result lower commissions for brokers. In a soft market, insurance buyers in the small- and mid-sized markets tend to reduce deductibles, increase their limits of coverage, and purchase new coverage. “Hard” periods can be precipitated by catastrophes, such as natural disasters, or similar significant losses, for example, severe credit market losses, that result in insurers’ capital becoming depleted or some insurers no longer being able to participate in the market. The lack of capital and decreased competition drives up premium rates, thereby the potential for greater profitability for the remaining insurers. Additionally, catastrophes or similar significant losses may also precipitate increased customer demand for insurance policies, driving demand for capital and further hardening the market. Hard and soft markets may also be affected by broad-based trends or by factors affecting individual insurance product lines or specific geographic areas. From 2016 to 2019, we were in a soft market with retractions in premium rates across the carriers. Beginning in 2019, rates and exposures began to increase and the market continued to harden in certain areas, particularly, catastrophe-exposed property and upper layers of management liability exposure in 2020 and 2021. The market continues to be generally hard though some lines are softening or moderating; however, it is not clear whether the rate and exposure increases will continue into the foreseeable future as economic conditions are difficult to predict.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting results of operations,17.2.4,Seasonality,"We experience some seasonality in the volumes of (re)insurance policies we place and, consequently, in our commission and fees, as most (re)insurance policies renew on the first day of the year. Like many of our competitors, we have also historically transacted less business in the last quarter of the calendar year than in other months. Accordingly, commission and fees for the first fiscal quarter tend to be slightly lower than the rest of the year. While our aggregate revenue varies from quarter to quarter in part as a function of the foregoing, our compensation expenses, selling expenses, administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year, with the exception of a step-up in spending following an acquisition. We recognize contingent revenue throughout the year and cash receipts tend to follow close to or shortly after. In the case of some of our business lines, such as treaty reinsurance or DUAL, the cash collection cycle may be longer and varies up to 24 months. Under the terms of our Existing Facilities, we are generally required to make monthly interest and quarterly principal payments on outstanding borrowings.

This exposure arises where revenue is received in currencies different from the currency of costs. A significant amount of our revenue is denominated in GBP (31% for the year ended September 30, 2023), USD (35% for the year ended September 30, 2023) and EUR (21% for the year ended September 30, 2023), while our costs are incurred in a number of currencies and weighted towards GBP. Therefore the Group generates most of its profits in USD and EUR but is loss-making in GBP. The Group’s debt servicing costs are in USD and EUR and the profits generated in USD and EUR are used to service this debt. While there is a hedging program to buy GBP-sell USD to give some certainty over cash flows, the USD and EUR profits are largely unhedged to act as economic hedge over the Group’s debt leverage given the Group’s debt is largely in USD or EUR. Therefore if the USD/EUR debt fluctuates in value in GBP terms due to foreign exchange, there is a compensating movement in the USD/EUR profits to maintain leverage. Furthermore, as we present our consolidated financial statements in GBP, we are required to translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all operations that use a functional currency other than GBP. We translate into GBP at then-applicable exchange rates, exposing us to translation risk (i.e., the risk that exchange rates will impact the value of our income, assets, liabilities and expenses reported in GBP even if the value has ----- not changed in the underlying currency). Currency translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and could result in significant changes to the carrying value of assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The Existing Facilities bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or SOFR (LIBOR historically), as applicable, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future and our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. As for September 30, 2023, the Group estimates that, through the combination of the natural hedge and interest rate derivatives (swaps and cap), a weighted average of 67% (2022: 61%, 2021: 36%) of the notional amount of the Existing Term Loans was hedged for the period to March 2024. This further decreases to a weighted average of 66% (2022: 41%, 2021: 18%) of the notional amount of the Existing Term Loans being hedged for the period to March 2025 and 8% for the remaining period to maturity on November 2, 2027.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

In addition to these material acquisitions, a number of smaller acquisitions were made which further impacts the year-on-year comparisons. The results of each of these acquisitions and disposals are included in the Financial Statements from the date the relevant transaction was completed and are further detailed in the notes to the Financial Statements. Our Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2023 include, among others, the following acquisitions in comparison with the Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2022: - 6 months of activity of March R.S., acquired on March 22, 2023 and consolidated into our broking business in Europe. The acquisition of the Spanish insurance broker reflects Howden’s growth strategy in Europe, expanding Howden Iberia’s client offering. Since its acquisition, March R.S. has contributed revenue of £11 million and an Operating Loss of £0.2 million to the Group for the year ended September 30, 2023. - 9 months of activity of TigerRisk Partners, acquired on January 9, 2023, which has since been consolidated into our Howden Tiger division. Since its acquisition, Howden Tiger has contributed revenue of £171.4 million and an Operating profit of £16.1 million to the Group for the year ended September 30, 2023. Our Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 include, among others, the following acquisitions in comparison with the Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2021: - 12 months of activity of Align Financial Holdings LLC and its controlled subsidiaries, acquired on October 1, 2021 and consolidated into our MGA business in the US. Since its acquisition, Align has contributed revenue of £84.3 million and an operating profit of £10.2 million to the Group for the year ended September 30, 2022. - 5 months of activity of the Aston Lark Group, acquired April 21, 2022 and consolidated into our broking business in the UK and Ireland. Since its acquisition, Aston Lark contributed revenue of £91.8 million and an operating profit of £3.7 million to the Group for the year ended September 30, 2022. - 4 months of activity of 93% of the economic interest in Assiteca S.p.A and its controlled subsidiaries, Italy’s third largest brokerage company, acquired on May 6, 2022 and consolidated into our non-UK broking business. Since its acquisition, Assiteca has contributed revenue of £17.8 million and an operating loss of £11.6 million to the Group for the year ended September 30, 2022. ----- If the acquisitions that completed during the fiscal year ended 2021 had been made on October 1, 2020, the consolidated income statement under IFRS for the year ended September 30, 2021 would have reflected revenue of £1,147.9 million and operating profit of £56.8 million. If the acquisitions that completed during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 had been made on October 1, 2021, our consolidated income statement under IFRS for the year ended September 30, 2022 would have reflected revenue of £1,843.4 million and operating profit of £220.2 million. If the acquisitions that completed during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 had been made on October 1, 2022, our consolidated income statement under IFRS for the year ended September 30, 2023 would have reflected revenue of £2,442.9 million and operating loss of £16.3 million.

This increase was driven in large part by the impact of acquisitions (being both the post-acquisition results of acquisitions made in the year ended September 30, 2023 (£186.2 million), the largest of which relate to TigerRisk, as well as the impact of acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2022, the largest of which relates to Aston Lark and Assiteca (£214.0 million)). The £214.0 million represents the increase in Aston Lark and Assiteca revenue and other M&A from 2022 to 2023. The residual increase in fees and commissions relates to growth of other businesses in the Group’s perimeter that had been in existence as at September 30, 2022. _Americas_ Fees and commissions increased in the Americas by £191.2 million or 45.3%, from £421.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £613.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was partly due to organic growth through local initiatives, and partly driven by the acquisition of TigerRisk in January 2023 (£136.2 million). The primary drivers of organic growth in the region was due to new business and market conditions. Aside from the acquisition of TigerRisk, there was no other material M&A activity. _UK_ In the UK, fees and commissions increased significantly by £208.8 million or 45.6%, from £458.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £667 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver for this was the impact of Aston Lark results following its acquisition in April 2022, and a number of other acquisitions made in the UK such as Media Insurance Brokers and Reich Group during 2023, which in aggregate totaled £120.6 million. Revenue growth was also driven by good organic growth due to improving market conditions across motor and home insurance products in particular. _Northern Europe_ Northern Europe saw growth of £75.4 million or 30.9% during the year ended September 30, 2023, from £244.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £319.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was achieved largely due to investments both through acquisitions made in both 2022 and 2023 and investment in New Initiatives. _Asia_ Asia also experienced growth in fees and commissions, increasing by £19 million or 13.1%, from £145.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £164.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. There were two main drivers for this growth; organic growth in the region and the continued recovery of Howden High Net Worth, the Group’s high net worth business in Asia, which was impacted by the closure of borders in Asia during the Covid-19 global pandemic. ----- _Middle East_ Fees and commissions increased in the Middle East by £9.1 million or 12.3%, from £73.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £82.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The drivers behind this were organic growth and local initiatives. No acquisitions were made in the region during the year. _Australasia_ Australasia had growth of £22.2 million or 39.7%, from £55.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to £78.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in New Initiatives in the region as well as good underwriting conditions for the MGA business. _Southern Europe_ Fees and commissions also saw growth of £93 million or 80.7% in Southern Europe, increasing from £115.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £208.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of Assiteca in May 2022 and March RS in March 2023 as well as a number of smaller acquisitions across 2022 and 2023. _Eastern Europe_ Eastern Europe experienced growth in the year of £6.6 million or 25.6%, from £25.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £32.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was because of organic growth in the region due to new business and positive market conditions. M&A activity in Eastern Europe was limited unlike in the other regions. _Africa_ Fees and commissions in Africa decreased by £2 million or 13.3%, from £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £13 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by local market conditions in what is the Group’s smallest geography by location of end client. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased significantly by £102.5 million, or 148.1%, from £69.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £171.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by fiduciary income arising from increasing interest rates (£31.3 million) and an expansion in non-insurance placement activities such as mortgage and real estate advisory following the acquisition of SPF in August 2022, capital advisory services following the acquisition of TigerRisk in January 2023 and premium financing arrangements. _Insurance income_ Insurance income decreased by £5.6 million, or 93.3%, from £6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by the timing of premium recognition over the period of underlying cover of policies, which had expired by September 30, 2022, with some reinstatement premiums recognized in the year ended September 30, 2023. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs increased by £753.8 million, or 60.3%, from £1,249.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £2,003.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating costs was due to the enlarged footprint of the business following a number of acquisitions, the largest of which were Aston Lark and Assiteca in 2022 and TigerRisk in 2023 with an overall impact of £358.4 million from the annualization of M&A for the year ended September 30, 2022 and the impact of M&A for the year ended September 30, 2023. Within operating costs there was also a change in net foreign exchange loss of £76.0 million. Finally, there continues to be strong investment in New Initiatives largely relating to headcount ----- and set-up costs, integration of M&A and other Group investment programs, which all contributed to an increase in other operating costs. See “—Key income statement items”for further detail in relation to operating costs. _Insurance expense_ Insurance expense decreased by £13.7 million, or 137.0%, from a charge of £10 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £3.7 million gain for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was due to a downward revision in the expected ultimate claims settlement. _Impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets_ Impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets decreased by £4.8 million, or 55.2%, from £8.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £3.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The movement between September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022 was impacted by heightened risk of credit risk arising from global economic conditions as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other political developments. However the change in credit risk profile between September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023 was not as significant as in the prior year. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization expense increased by £211.8 million, or 120.3%, from £176 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £387.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase in the expense was driven by the amortization of acquired intangibles from acquisitions both in the current year and in the prior year as well as £127.7 million accelerated amortization of acquired brand assets which were rebranded to one global Howden brand on October 1, 2023. _Dividend income_ Dividend income increased by £1.2 million, or 300%, from £0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by the underlying performance and timing of dividends of minority equity investments. _Gain/loss on disposal_ Gain on disposal increased by £3.8 million, or 1,900%, from £0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to £4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by the disposal of certain non-core operations. _Finance income_ Finance income increased significantly, by £17.1 million, or 462.2%, from £3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £20.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 due to increased interest returns on cash holdings and investments in money market funds arising from rising interest rate environment. _Finance costs_ Finance costs increased significantly by £75.9 million, or 30.1%, from £252.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £328.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase is driven by the increase in interest rates and the increase in borrowings to fund the Group’s expansion plans, which increased by £826.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, to £4,534.5 million, from £3,707.7 million as at September 30, 2022. In addition, the relative strengthening of the GBP since September 2022 due to market conditions drove an £95.3 million gain in the foreign exchange gains on USD and EUR denominated borrowings when translated back to GBP, which partially offset the increase in finance costs. _Fair value through profit or loss_ Fair value through profit or loss increased by £12.6 million, or 59.7%, from £21.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to £33.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to upward revaluation of contingent consideration and put option on non-controlling interests due to improved forecasts. ----- _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense decreased significantly by £56.6 million, or 602.1%, from a charge of £9.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, to a £47.2 million gain for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by a net release of deferred tax liabilities. The deferred tax movements relate to release of deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets as these are amortized and other short term timing differences. _Loss after tax from continuing operations_ Loss after tax from continuing operations was £328.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to £92.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

This increase was driven in large part by the impact of acquisitions (being both the post-acquisition results of acquisitions made in the year ended September 30, 2022 (£209.8 million)), the largest of which relate to Align, Aston Lark and Assiteca, as well as the impact of acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2021, the largest of which relates to A-Plan (£111.6 million in revenue contribution for the period under consideration). The residual increase in fees and commissions relate to organic growth of other businesses in the Group’s perimeter that had been in existence as at September 30, 2021. _Americas_ Fees and commissions increased in the Americas by £167.1 million, or 65.6%, from £254.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £421.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This was partly due to local initiatives, and partly driven by the acquisition of Align in October 2022 (£84.3 million). The primary drivers of organic growth in the region were due to new business and market conditions. Aside from the acquisition of Align, there was no other material M&A activity. _UK_ In the UK, fees and commissions increased significantly by £206.5 million, or 82%, from £251.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £458.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The primary driver for this was the impact of A-Plan results following its acquisition in March 2021, and the acquisition of Aston Lark in April 2022. _Northern Europe_ Fees and commissions in Northern Europe increased by £52.8 million, or 27.6%, from £191.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £244.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This was achieved through local European initiatives. _Asia_ Asia also experienced growth in fees and commissions, increasing by £34.2 million, or 30.8%, from £111 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £145.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The two main drivers for this growth were general growth in the region and, secondly, the recovery of Howden Private Wealth (formerly known as IPG), the Group’s high net worth business in Asia, which was impacted by the closure of borders in Asia following the Covid-19 global pandemic. _Middle East_ Fees and commissions increased in the Middle East by £18.4 million, or 33.3%, from £55.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £73.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The drivers behind this were local initiatives. No acquisitions were made in the region during the year. ----- _Australasia_ Fees and commissions in Australia increased by £12.3 million, or 28.2%, from £43.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to £55.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily driven by an increase in New Initiatives in the region. _Southern Europe_ Fees and commissions in Southern Europe increased by £54.7 million, or 90.3%, from £60.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £115.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of Assiteca in May 2022. _Eastern Europe_ Fees and commissions in Eastern Europe experienced growth in the year of £5 million, or 24%, from £20.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £25.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Performance in the region grew purely from new business and market conditions, as there was little M&A activity unlike in certain other regions. _Africa_ Fees and commissions in Africa increased by £6.5 million, or 76.5%, from £8.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £15 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This was due to improvement of business in the region caused by new business and market conditions. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased significantly by £27.7 million, or 66.7%, from £41.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £69.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was driven by growth and an expansion in non-insurance placement activities such as insurance comparison related products and mortgage and real estate advisory. _Insurance income_ Insurance income increased by £1.4 million, or 30.4%, from £4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was driven by the timing of premium recognition over the period of underlying cover of policies. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs increased by £374.1 million, or 42.7%, from £875.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £1.2 billion for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in operating costs was due to the enlarged footprint of the business following a number of acquisitions, the largest of which were A-plan in 2021 and Align, Aston Lark and Assiteca in 2022, as a result of which our headcount increased and costs associated with New Initiatives and M&A activities also increased. In addition, these acquisitions led to a ramp-up of the Group’s need for back office support, which had an overall impact of £253.3 million from the annualization of M&A for the year end September 30, 2021 and the impact of M&A for the year ended September 30, 2022. See “—Key income statement items” for further detail in relation to operating costs. _Insurance expense_ Insurance expense decreased slightly by £0.3 million, or 2.9%, from £10.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £10 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Insurance expense has been broadly flat year-on-year; however, a downward change in claim movements accounted for the small decline during the year ended September 30, 2022. _Impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets_ Impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets increased significantly by £7.9 million, or 987.5%, from £0.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £8.7 million for the year ended September 30, ----- 2022 as a result of the increased size of the Group. In addition, there was a heightened risk of credit risk arising from global economic conditions as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other political developments. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization increased by £75.8 million, or 75.6%, from £100.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £176 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase in the Group’s depreciation and amortization expense was driven by the amortization of acquired intangibles from acquisitions both in the current year and in the prior year. _Dividend income_ Dividend income decreased by £0.2 million, or 33.3%, from £0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This is driven by the underlying performance and timing of dividends of minority equity investments. _Gain on disposal_ Gain on disposal stayed largely consistent throughout the period under review and there were no material disposals during the periods under review. _Finance income_ Finance income decreased significantly by £52 million, or 93.4%, from £55.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as a result of a one-off gain of £53.5 million arising in the year end September 30, 2021 due to a favorable debt modification of the Existing Term Loans to reduce the interest charge and extend the tenor of the borrowings. _Finance costs_ Finance costs increased significantly by £178.2 million, or 240.5%, from £74.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £252.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was driven by a £2,127.2 million increase in borrowings to fund the Group’s expansion plans. In addition, the relative weakening of the GBP in September 2022 due to market conditions drove an increase of £98.8 million in the foreign exchange losses on USD and EUR denominated borrowings when translated back to GBP. _Fair value through profit or loss_ Fair value through profit or loss decreased significantly by £12.5 million, or 37.2%, from £33.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £21.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was driven by the change in equity structure of the group following the acquisition of all the subsidiaries and operations from HGH Limited by HGH Finance and the restated comparatives. _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense decreased significantly by £17.6 million, or 65.2%, from £27 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to £9.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was driven by an increased current tax charge of £13.2 million due to an underlying increase in trading profits, offset by deferred tax movements of £30.8 million. The deferred tax movements relate to release of deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets as these are amortized and other short term timing differences. _Loss after tax from continuing operations_ Loss after tax from continuing operations was £92.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to £20.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Movements in such fiduciary cash balances are included in the cash flow under IFRS reporting, thus reflected below. Cash flows from operating activities correspond to loss after tax, plus income tax expense, plus fair value through profit and loss, less movement due to foreign exchange, plus acquisitions costs, less dividend income, plus net finance costs, plus depreciation and amortization, plus share based payments, plus goodwill and intangible assets impairment, plus employee services post business combination, less the gain on sale of subsidiaries and other non-current assets, adjusted for the increase or decrease in the following assets and liabilities: non-current trade and other receivables, insurance investments, insurance receivables, current other receivables accrued income and prepayments, cost of fulfillment asset, insurance payables, current trade and other payables, deferred income, non-current trade and other payables, provisions, and insurance underwriting balance. Cash flows from investing activities correspond to purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets, investment in subsidiaries (net of acquired cash, associates and joint ventures), issue/repayment of loan receivables, proceeds from disposal of operations, purchase or disposal of investments held at fair value through profit and loss, dividend income and transactions with equity holders (largely the issuance of loans to employee shareholders of the HGH Limited). Cash flows from financing activities correspond to fluctuations from borrowings, proceeds from issue of share capital, acquisition of non-controlling interests, dividends payable to non-controlling shareholders, financing derivatives, transactions with former equity holders (funding of share buybacks of HGH Limited), lease principal repayments and settlement of deferred consideration obligations.

The decrease was due to interest costs, which increased by £152.7 million due the rising interest rate environment and an increase in borrowings raised during the year to fund corporate activities such as acquisitions and investment in New Initiatives. The investment in New Initiatives also consumed cash while the relevant books of business were built. The net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £33.7 million to £164.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 from £198.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 (restated). The decrease was ----- due to interest costs, which increased by £111.6 million due to an increase in borrowings raised during the year to fund corporate activities such as acquisitions and investment in New Initiatives, partly offset by an increase in cash from operations. This movement includes the impact of the presentation reclassification of two line items, which together accounts for a decrease of £23.4 million in cash from operating activities. Specifically, acquisition costs were reclassified from investing activities to operating activities, contributing to a £26.3 million decrease of cash inflow from operating activities from September 30, 2021.

The increase was due to a net increase in investment in financial instruments of £165.5 million, which are largely money market funds not classified as cash and cash equivalents under IFRS and an increase of £35.7 million investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets due to the various Group transformational IT programs in front end trading systems and general increase in the size of the Group. These were partially offset by a net reduction of £118.6 million spend on acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired. The net cash outflow from investing activities increased significantly by £858.1 million to £1,147.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 from £289.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2021 (restated). The increase was primarily due to increased acquisition activity in the year led by Aston Lark Group (cash consideration of £654 million) and Align (cash consideration of £377.8 million) along with a number of smaller M&A.

As of September 30, 2023, our unrestricted own cash and cash equivalents (net of bank overdrafts) and debt proceeds held in cash or money market funds, amounted to £817.8 million. Our restricted cash balances of ----- £139.3 million as of September 30, 2023 (including £31.9 million investment in money market funds) pertains to £81.1 million of cash and money market funds held in the retro reinsurance cells in our Guernsey vehicles and £58.2 million held in entities locally for regulatory reasons and to satisfy orderly wind down obligations. We do not expect such restrictions on cash to impact the overall liquidity of the Group; restricted cash; for the avoidance of doubt, restricted cash is not included in any calculations of net debt, net leverage or similar credit metrics. In addition, there is £630 million of capacity under our New Revolving Credit Facility, £75 million of which was drawn subsequent to September 30, 2023 for short-term working capital purposes but intended to be repaid shortly following the Issue Date. The Board monitors the forecast levels of borrowings and leverage ratios to ensure it remains within its risk appetite. The Group also has a number of put options granted to several non-controlling shareholders and key senior management in relation to their minority shareholding. If one or more put options were exercised, we would be required to fund a payment in cash to the relevant option holder in accordance with the relevant agreement. In such circumstances, depending on the amount, the payments may be made in several installments over a period in order to preserve liquidity. In 2023, the Group drew an additional £1,000 million of fresh equity from its institutional investors to fund M&A and expansion plans. This follows over £700 million of fresh equity from its institutional investors in the preceding two years. We currently have, and, following the completion of the Transactions, will continue to have, substantial debt. After giving effect to the Transactions as of September 30, 2023, our Total Debt is expected to amount to £5,603 million. After giving effect to the Transactions, the Group’s main borrowings mature in 2030 to 2033 and will be refinanced at an appropriate time in the future. We expect that, following the completion of the Transactions, our primary sources of cash will be cash flows from operating activities and cash balances and borrowings under our debt facilities, including the New Credit Facilities and the Notes. We anticipate continued support from our Sponsors in the form of additional equity funding to maintain the Group’s leverage and risk profile within sustainable parameters. Historically, our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that they will continue to be, operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and costs related to New Initiatives, integration costs and deferred consideration arrangements, and debt service payments. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, whether equity or debt, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Our Substantial Leverage and Debt Service Obligations Could _Adversely Affect Our Business and Prevent Us from Fulfilling Our Obligations With Respect to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ We believe that, based on our current level of operations, our cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service payments for at least the next twelve months.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The amounts presented in the statement of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and clients. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited as the counterparties are the Group’s bankers with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. In respect of managing credit risk arising over trade and other receivables, the subsidiaries across the Group maintain credit control teams as appropriate to manage the credit risk and in some business units, a variable element of remuneration of employees is linked to cash collection. The Group applies the lifetime credit risk model to insurance receivables. The Group monitors the ageing of insurance receivables based on whether it is current or not and days past due. Management provides for all balances more than 365 days overdue and for all remaining balances a provision for impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets is created based on prior experience of bad debt unless a specific provision is created due to there being an identified loss. An example of an event triggering a specific provision for impairment losses on financial assets and/or contract assets would be a counterparty in known distressed financial situation. The main input in determining ----- the lifetime credit loss is the average historical bad debt experience rate based typically over the last three years. The Group applies the 12 month credit loss model to other receivables unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The main input is the likelihood of a default occurring in the next 12 months based on past experience and current market conditions given the majority of the other receivables are due within 12 months. The total expected credit loss provision on insurance receivables as of September 30, 2023 was £23.3 million (2022: £21.6 million, 2021: £12.4 million). The increase is predominantly driven from net additional recognition of provision following recoverability review as well as the overall increase in size of Group driven by acquisitions and organic growth. The bad debt expense recognized in respect of insurance and trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 was £3.9 million (2022: £8.7 million, 2021: £0.8 million).",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.27,Quantitative and Qualitative Information Regarding Market and Operating Risks,17.27.2,Interest Rate Risk,"The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is on the interest payable on the Group’s variable rate borrowings, including overdrafts, and interest receivables on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. As a result, the Group is subject to a certain degree of interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates. The Group is not subject to interest rate risk in relation to the fixed rate borrowings. The exposure for the Group, as at September 30, 2023, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates (i.e. giving cash flow interest rate risk) when the interest rate is due to be re-set and fixed interest rates (i.e. giving fair value interest rate risk) when the financial instrument is due for repayment. The Group’s largest exposure to interest rate risk relates to the Existing Dollar Term Loans where the USD portion has interest payable based on SOFR (LIBOR historically) and the EUR portion has interest payable based on EURIBOR. While there is a partial natural hedge with USD and EUR denominated insurance cash and investments earning floating SOFR (LIBOR historically) or EURIBOR interest, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage the interest rate risk. It is estimated that through the combination of the natural hedge and interest rate derivatives (swaps and cap), a weighted average of 67% (2022: 61%, 2021: 36%) of the notional amount of the Existing Term Loans are hedged for the period to March 2024. This further decreases to a weighted average of 66% (2022: 41%, 2021: 18%) of the notional amount of the Existing Term Loans hedged for the period to March 2025 and to 50% (2022: 8%) for the remaining period to November 2027. The total fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps was £73.7 million as at September 30, 2023, of which £56.4 million was recorded in current derivative financial instrument assets and £17.3 million was recorded in non-current derivative financial instrument assets. The total fair value of the interest rate swaps was £81.9 million as at September 30, 2022, of which £42.2 million was recorded in current derivative financial instrument assets, £42 million was recorded in non-current derivative financial instrument assets and £2.3 million was recorded in non-current derivative financial instrument liabilities. The interest swaps and the intrinsic portion of the interest rate caps have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges on inception of the hedging instruments. The swaps and caps are recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated statement of financial position, with fair value movements on the swaps and intrinsic portion of the caps are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve via the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, as long as the requirements for hedge accounting are met and are effective. Amounts are recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve as and when the hedged forecast transaction occurs. Fair value movements in relation to time value of the interest rate caps are recognized in the cost of hedging reserve and amortized into the consolidated income statement over the life of the instrument. Historically, some interest rate hedges have been terminated as they no longer met the risk management objectives due to mismatch between variable interest rate risk and hedging instrument or an economic relationship was no longer able to be demonstrated between the hedged item and hedging instruments. On termination date, the balance in cash flow hedging reserve is recycled over the remaining life of the derivative ----- as the underlying forecast transaction is still expected to occur and the changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated income statement. For the year ended September 30, 2023, a loss of £6.6 million (2022: £74.9 million gain, 2021: £2.3 million loss) excluding tax was recognized in other comprehensive income. A gain of £37.6 million (2022: £7.7 million loss, 2021: £11.1 million loss) was recycled from equity to profit and loss. A total gain of £3.6 million (2022: gain of £17.6 million, 2021: loss of £0.6 million) was recognized in finance costs from hedge ineffectiveness arising from credit risk and changes in fair value of swaps, where the hedging relationship has been terminated. A 50 basis points change in reference interest rates did not have a material impact for the years under review. In respect of LIBOR transition, all tranches of the Group’s Existing Dollar Term Loans and Second Lien Facility, which had USD LIBOR as the reference rate have transitioned to Synthetic US Dollar LIBOR as at September 30, 2023. Interest rate derivatives, which had USD LIBOR on the floating rate of the swap have been amended to be based on Term SOFR plus the ISDA credit adjustment (“ISDA CAS”) or Compound SOFR plus ISDA CAS. Synthetic LIBOR will cease to be published on September 30, 2024 and further transition will be required.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.27,Quantitative and Qualitative Information Regarding Market and Operating Risks,17.27.3,Insurance risk,"The three key components of insurance risk are underwriting, reinsurance and reserving. - Underwriting: Poor claims experience could lead to larger losses than anticipated. The Group has issued reinsurance to a third party coverholder providing capacity to a retrocessional binder, with the coverholder delegating underwriting authority to a subsidiary of the Group. The retro binder covers a range of risks where there are detailed historical records over claims; however, there is no certainty the claims pattern will repeat for the future. This detailed dataset, allied with a subsidiary of the Group having delegated underwriting authority helps ensure the quality of underwriting despite the Group not previously taking on insurance risk. The Group’s losses are limited to the collateral placed for the reinsurance contract. Scenarios were modelled based on catastrophe models, which evaluate expected results over a significant timeframe and not for any one year. Based on these models, it is anticipated that there is a 2% chance for the complete exhaustion of collateral when the cover was issued. - Reinsurance: As this is the first time the Group has taken on balance sheet risk and the low risk of complete utilization of collateral, no reinsurance has been taken. Once there is sufficient certainty over the claims development, reinsurance may be considered to effectively lock in performance and minimize deterioration of results. - Reserving: Reserving risk arises where insurance liabilities are insufficient. To manage this risk, actuarial analysis is deployed to project the ultimate claims ratio as well monitoring for claims made and incurred claims but not yet reported on a regular basis. Reserving exercises include expert input from the underwriter and independently from actuarial resources within the Group, with additional external review where appropriate. The selected reserves were within a range of possible outcomes from known, specific events considered with potential to result in higher or lower total claims to be paid. The upper and lower bounds or the range would have increased/ decreased the claims liability by £19.0 million and £11.8 million respectively. For claims made, it is anticipated that the amount and timing of claims payments is typically resolved within three years.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The Group’s policy is to: align the Existing Facilities’ servicing costs in USD/EUR and operating profits in USD/EUR and monitor, and where appropriate, to hedge foreign currency transaction exposures. For the latter, this is most prevalent in certain subsidiaries where the costs are largely denominated in GBP but revenue is earned in a number of foreign currencies. In this situation, foreign exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies and buy GBP can be entered into to cover a proportion of the forecast foreign currency receipts. The amount forward sold is considered based on amounts after debt servicing in currency and acceptable impact on leverage for extreme movements in foreign exchange. ----- In the current and prior year, the Group entered into a series of foreign exchange forwards to buy GBP-sell USD to hedge foreign exchange risk arising in a GBP functional currency subsidiary which had USD income. These forwards were designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from the revenue recognition and subsequent arising receivable. As at September 30, 2023, some of these forwards with a carrying value of £0.2 million had not yet expired. In addition, the Group designated a portion of the EUR Term Loan and USD Term loan as hedging instruments in net investment hedges of EUR and USD foreign operations. The hedging instruments were recorded in non-current borrowings. The hedged risk is the foreign exchange risk arising on the value of the Group’s net investment in assets and liabilities in USD and EUR functional currency entities. The net gain or loss under this arrangement is recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair value changes and net effect on other comprehensive income in the year ended September 30, 2023 was a loss of £31.6 million (2022: £56.5 million gain, 2021: £9.9 million gain).",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The broking process involves negotiating policy terms and placing the client’s risk with a suitable insurer, either directly or via an underwriting agency or a wholesale broker. Wholesale Brokers:_ They function as intermediaries between retail brokers and insurance carriers, typically in specialty lines of insurance. Wholesale brokers focus on the more complex or high-risk coverage areas and typically do not have direct contact with the insured, and instead provide access to insurance carriers and ----- products that a retail broker might otherwise not have. In some cases, wholesale brokers also serve as intermediaries between underwriting agencies and insurance carriers. Reinsurance Brokers:_ They facilitate the transfer of risk from an insurance carrier to a reinsurer, aiding in the diversification and management of the insurer’s risk exposure. Underwriting Agencies:_ They serve as intermediaries between insurance companies and brokers or customers. These agencies may act as MGAs, which issue and administer policies, handle claims, and oversee renewals on behalf of insurance companies. They carry out most of the traditional insurer activities, including underwriting and pricing, except for providing capital and incurring liabilities for claims. Their performance is measured by underwriting results. Their profitability may also be influenced by “loss-sharing” agreements with insurance companies, which are contingent on the agencies’ underwriting performance.

We do not assume underwriting risk for the insurance policies we assist in placing and the compensation model for our services typically involves commissions based on premium levels or fees for services rendered. Consequently, the performance of the insurance brokerage sector is dependent on the economic performance of the broader insurance and reinsurance markets, reflected in the premiums placed. The volume of premiums placed is dependent on the insurance rates and the underlying amount of coverage purchased. The amount of coverage purchased is typically correlated to the overall GDP level and macroeconomic factors underlying each specific client industry and/or risk class.

Facultative reinsurance involves insuring large single risk exposures of insurers whereas treaty reinsurance involves insuring a collection of insurance policies. The business provides services across a wide range of business lines including property, casualty, cyber, facultative, retrocessional, legacy liability, aviation and space, marine, energy and specialty, credit surety and political risk, professional liability, health and life and medical and lawyers’ public liability, and has strong trading relationships with the world’s largest reinsurers.

Howden Markets also provides certain of our businesses, such as DUAL, Howden Tiger and our International Growth Markets, with strategic capacity services. _Howden Group Placement_ Howden Group Placement plays a key role within our Group, acting as the primary advocate for our clients in collaboration with our trading teams. This team works closely with our network of chief broking officers and related roles across the business, ensuring a coordinated and strategic approach to (re)insurance market activities, thereby enhancing our day-to-day trading operations, driving effective deployment of our capacity. Howden Group Placement serves as a central hub for various functions, including handling requests for proposals, managing critical and complex placements, facilitating C-suite escalations, addressing new capacity requirements for significant product portfolios and providing support for the design and placement of insurance facilities, panels, and portfolios—additionally, it assists in executing placement initiatives launched by our broking businesses. Howden Group Placement also plays a critical role in our strategic partners’ engagement, actively supporting regular quarterly business reviews, collaborating on placement and product initiatives, monitoring service performance and providing feedback. Furthermore, Howden Group Placement’s global reach enables us to handle escalations, critical coverage requests, disputed claims and dispute resolution (errors and omissions) matters, irrespective of jurisdiction. _Climate Risk and Resilience_ In March 2021, Howden set up a Climate Risk and Resilience team focused on helping corporate, financial sector and government actors across the globe understand the impact of risks like climate change, crisis resilience and the transition to a low carbon world.

Our New Initiatives capitalize on the loyalty that clients commonly exhibit towards their current brokers, leading to the addition of a significant number of employees in recent years. In the year ended September 30, 2023, we had approximately 1,120 employees in New Initiatives, which made up approximately 30% of the Group’s Organic Revenue Growth for the year ended September 30, 2023, contributing approximately 4% to our Organic Revenue Growth of 13% in this period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,284,M&A,284.2,Information Technology,284.2.1,,"We invest heavily in technology, data and analytics in order to provide innovative solutions for our clients as well as delivering IT capabilities internally to support our growth. ----- We are standardizing our trading platforms to generate efficiencies, implement a standard data model and mitigate end of serviceable life risk. We have also adopted leading software-as-a-service applications to create a scalable and global back-office application suite that can be rolled out to all businesses, supporting enhanced reporting and control, as well as streamlining processes and costs. We also have an ‘On-Net’ program which focuses on bringing Group companies onto common infrastructure platforms to enhance security, reliability and scalability benefits. Technology plays an increasingly important role in every aspect of the design and delivery of our products and services. We integrate insurance experience and digital expertise that create digital products and services for clients. Notable products include Nova and Rethink, which deliver digital solutions and data insights to clients and insurers to help inform decision making. As part of our growth strategy, we recently launched Howden Ventures, an end-to-end platform that accelerates the launch and growth of new insurance products by bringing together funding, capacity, expertise, governance and distribution. Howden Ventures is backed by a £10 million Howden Fund and a £500 million binding authority agreement, which provides pre-syndicated capacity to allow start-ups to trade once they have developed a product to test with the market. Howden Ventures is a division of DUAL, which provides critical infrastructure as an MGA incubator and connects Howden Ventures with the distribution network and expertise of the Howden Group. Recently, Howden Ventures acquired a stake in CetoAI, a marine software-as-a-service start-up that repurposes data produced by sensors connected to the ships’ alarm monitoring systems to provide fuel usage, carbon emissions and machinery maintenance analytics. Our investment in CetoAI is designed in the short term to fund a pilot which will underwrite a small portfolio of marine hull risk where CetoAI devices are installed and, in the long term, to create a MGA focused on ship-related risks. _Clients_ We serve a broad range of clients, from individuals to extensive global corporations, and we are committed to identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to cross-sell specialized products globally. Our expertise encompasses not only traditional P&C products but also extends to emerging sectors like cybersecurity, M&A, as well as climate risk and resilience solutions. Our client base is large and diversified, and no material part of our business depends upon a single group of clients. We therefore believe that the loss of any one client would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. _Sustainability and ESG_ As we continue to grow as a Group, it is important that we continue to grow responsibly. In 2023, we created a new governance structure to support our increasing work on all aspects of ESG, and to help us respond to increasing stakeholder and regulatory demands that continue to evolve across geographies. Our Sustainability Committee became a sub-committee of the board of directors of HGH Limited and was expanded to focus both on the climate-related impacts on the Group and the impacts of the Group on the climate (i.e. double materiality focused), and was renamed to reflect this as ‘The ESG & Sustainability Committee’. Our commitment to sustainability and ESG actively involves our colleagues in managing our impact on the environment and our local communities, as well as the actions we take to be a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our innovations, such as the Red Cross volcano catastrophe bond or micro-insurance in Tanzania, are designed to help support vulnerable communities, transition to a low carbon economy, and facilitate economic growth and resilience. We assist in mitigating the financial obstacles commonly encountered by sustainable energy projects. For example, there is a risk that the carbon credits being produced are not sequestering the correct amount of carbon dioxide, due to fraud or negligence by the project developers: Howden holds the distinction of being the first broker to provide insurance coverage addressing this concern, available in both the regulated market and the voluntary carbon market. We also believe in the pivotal role of insurance in facilitating essential funding during critical times, including to humanitarian organizations. For example, parametric insurance, built on pre-agreed triggers that result in pre-agreed payments, can provide the immediacy and reliability of funding needed to prevent a disaster from ----- turning into a crisis, and reduce the overall financial and, more importantly, human cost. We have deployed parametric insurance to support vulnerable communities in Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu, by developing and launching the Pacific region’s first parametric micro insurance products in partnership with UNCDF (the UN Capital Development Fund). Additionally, we have played an active role in assisting humanitarian organizations, for example by acting as a broker to provide insurance cover to a UN-led mission in Yemen to remove oil from a vessel to avert an environmental disaster. We also completed a review of the environmental impacts of our operations and identified two primary impact areas (i.e. (i) energy and emissions, and (ii) waste and recycling), and two secondary impact areas (i.e. (i) water and liquid waste, and (ii) biodiversity and nature), on which we will focus our efforts going forward. We further built out our central specialist team to manage environmental sustainability across the Group, whilst also implementing a net-zero and environmental data and reporting platform. Furthermore, the Group continues to work with the relevant regulators to ensure that all aspects of its business comply with local ESG rules and regulations. We also provide additional protection against the social and economic shocks of climate change through our charitable foundation, the Howden Foundation, which was established in 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We believe that our commitment to employee equity ownership, paired with the increasing power of our brand and the reputation of our business, has enabled us to attract some of the best talent in the market, which is evidenced by the appointment of a number of well-respected, senior market experts in the recent years. We are dedicated to cultivating and maintaining a diverse workforce that mirrors society across our organization. Our aspiration revolves around establishing an inclusive workplace environment that is devoid of both deliberate and unintentional biases, where every employee’s worth and appraisal hinge on their individual performance and contributions. Founded, and led by David Howden for the past 30 years, and supported by a board of directors and an executive committee comprised of experienced, long-serving members, our Group is headed by an entrepreneurial management team with unwavering focus on long-term value creation through organic growth and M&A investments. Employee ownership remains integral to our corporate culture and stands as a significant distinguishing factor, as our most substantial shareholder base consists of our workforce, with approximately 4,500 employees currently owning around one-third of the Group’s shares. We track employee engagement through our global people survey and see consistent levels of employee engagement (75% for the year ended September 30, 2023). The average number of persons employed by the Group during the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 15,500 located in 50 international offices. We have on-boarded approximately 800 new employees in the last year to enhance our capabilities, with a particular focus on strengthening our expertise in areas such as reinsurance, cyber risk, energy transformation, climate risk and resilience, as well as expanding our presence in new countries, notably in Europe. We consider relations with our employees to be in good standing, and there are no pending employment-related class action lawsuits. The agreements we enter into with employees and consultants who have access to proprietary information generally contain confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions, and agreements entered into with most members of our executive management team include non-solicitation and some members of our executive team include non-compete covenants that are in force for a six month to one year period after the cessation of employment.

Proceedings initiated against us may include, ----- amongst other things, legal disputes initiated by clients or policyholders stemming from insurance placement or claims handling, notably in situations where substantial insurance claims have been denied by insurance providers. Such cases are relatively rare for a business of our size and have typically been consistently resolved expeditiously with the assistance of our errors and omissions insurance carriers. Additionally, from time to time we are involved in legal actions initiated by rival insurance intermediaries, typically arising where several individuals have joined our Group from these competing entities. These cases are typically resolved through confidential agreements in the early stages of the litigation process. On October 10, 2023, HGH Limited (and certain other companies in our Group) and Guy Carpenter & Company Limited (and certain other companies within the Guy Carpenter/Marsh McLennan Group, (the reinsurance broking arm of Marsh McLennan Companies, Inc.)) reached an agreement for settlement in the amount of £56.5 million (inclusive of Guy Carpenter’s costs) in respect of claims commenced by Guy Carpenter against the Group in the High Court of England and Wales. The claims related to alleged breach of employment obligations (including post termination restrictive covenants) within the employment and other agreements of 37 individual reinsurance brokers based in the UK and Europe who ceased employment with Guy Carpenter and were employed by our Group. We may be involved in various other legal proceedings and subject to claims from typical business activities, including alleged errors and omissions related to our insurance brokerage services and standard employment matters. Some of these claims receive partial coverage through insurance or contractual indemnification provisions, while others fall outside the purview of insurance and are self-insured. Regarding self-insured risks, we continually assess and, when necessary, adjust our insurance coverage based on the most current information available. Based on the most recent information available, we are of the opinion that these existing or potential claims, whether considered individually or in the aggregate, will not significantly impair our financial performance, cash flow, or overall financial standing. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that these proceedings, along with other claims, inherently carry uncertainties, and our assessment of these matters may evolve in the future. Moreover, as industry practices and legal, judicial and social conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage, including reinsurance coverage, may emerge. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not aware of any other legal, administrative, judicial, regulatory, tax or arbitral proceedings or investigations (including any pending or threatened proceedings or investigations) that are likely to have, or have had, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of legal proceedings and investigations, however, can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard.

The Incentive Shares are subject to financial performance targets and a hurdle relating to the value of the A shares (the “Hurdle”), and ordinarily vest at the end of a four or five-year vesting period. At the end of the relevant vesting period, to the extent the performance criteria has been met, the Incentive Shares convert into a number of A Shares determined by reference to the A share price at the time. Any Incentive Shares which do not meet their performance criteria convert to Deferred Shares and are repurchased for £1p in aggregate. D, E and G shares do not have voting rights. D and G shares do not have dividend rights, while E and F shares participate in dividends in excess of £0.20 per A share. HGH currently chooses to re-invest its profits for future growth rather than pay dividends to shareholders. _Internal Share Offer_ Our Board may make an invitation to Shareholders to sell some of their A Shares and to all eligible employees to purchase A Shares from time to time through an internal market (the “Internal Share Offer”or “ISO”).

If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal Priority Obligation Security Documents or by the exercise of any rights available to it under Applicable Law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies with respect to any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and any other Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and each other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties, as applicable, upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Company or any Guarantor becomes subject to an insolvency or liquidation proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or, in each case, under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law), each Equal Priority Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to ----- such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank equal in priority with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Equal Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their security interests on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority relative to all the other Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted security interests on any additional collateral pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority relative to the other Equal Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a_ security interest to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to security interests in favor of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that does not constitute Shared Collateral; _provided, further, that the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any_ other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Obligations Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended, amended and restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.9,Security for the Notes,59.9.8,Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement,"If, after the Issue Date, the Company and the Guarantors incur Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral having, or intending to have, a Junior Lien Priority ranking relative to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes Obligations, the Company, the Guarantors, the Senior Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and the applicable Junior Priority Collateral Agent(s) will enter into a junior priority intercreditor agreement having substantially the same terms as those described in this “—Junior _Priority Intercreditor Agreement” section (as the same may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced,_ supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, a “Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement”) or another Customary Intercreditor Agreement of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement may be entered into, and amended from time to time thereafter, without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Equal Priority Obligations and/or Junior Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements, or their respective representatives. We expect that under the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, at any time at which Equal Priority Obligations are outstanding, the Controlling Collateral Agent will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. Subject to the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the actions and determinations ----- by the Controlling Collateral Agent will be deemed to be the actions and determinations of, and controlling for, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will apply at all times prior to, during and after any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Company or any Guarantor and will provide, among other things, for Lien priorities as follows: (i) the Equal Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking senior in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations; and (ii) the Junior Priority Obligations shall be secured by Liens on the Collateral ranking junior in priority to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations; in each case, subject to Permitted Liens. Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations or of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any similar Applicable Law, any Junior Priority Obligations Documents, the Security Documents, or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and each other Junior Priority Representative, on behalf of itself and each Junior Priority Secured Party under its Junior Priority Obligations Documents, will agree that (1) any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any Equal Priority Secured Parties or any Senior Priority Representative or other agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and rank senior in all respects and prior to any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations and (2) any Lien created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Junior Priority Obligations then or thereafter held by or on behalf of, or created for the benefit of, any Junior Priority Collateral Agent, any Junior Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be subordinated to and rank junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens created on the Collateral (or purported to be created on the Collateral) securing any Equal Priority Obligations. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Controlling Collateral Agent holds a Lien on the Collateral securing any Equal Priority Obligations that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Collateral and if such Collateral is in fact in the possession or under the control of such Controlling Collateral Agent or of agents or bailees of such Controlling Collateral Agent, or if it shall any time obtain any landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or any similar agreement or arrangement granting it rights or access to the Collateral, such Controlling Collateral Agent shall also hold such Collateral, or take such actions with respect to such landlord waiver, bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement, as sub-agent or gratuitous bailee for the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties. _Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds_ The rights and remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties under the Junior Priority Security Documents and the actions permitted to be taken by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent thereunder with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Exercise of Remedies and Certain Other Provisions of the _Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement.” The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and the Junior Priority_ Obligations Documents will require that if any Equal Priority Obligations are then outstanding, the Collateral or the proceeds from any Collateral pursuant to the sale, other disposition, collection, enforcement of any security document or the exercise of any remedies thereunder, or upon any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to either the Company or any Guarantor, will be applied: (1) first, to pay the Equal Priority Obligations as more fully described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; and (2) second, to pay the Junior Priority Obligations. ----- The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also contain provisions that require the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent for the benefit of all Equal Priority Secured Parties any and all Collateral and proceeds thereof received in contravention of the payment priorities of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, for application in accordance with the prior paragraphs. Furthermore, if any Equal Priority Obligations or commitments related thereto are then outstanding, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will have no ability to control any foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to any of the Collateral (including, without limitation, the time or method); provided, however, that if (i) the Company and Guarantor are not subject to an insolvency or liquidation proceeding and (ii) none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent nor any Equal Priority Secured Party is diligently pursuing foreclosure or other exercise of remedies in good faith with respect to the Collateral for 180 days after notice by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent to the Controlling Collateral Agent of an Event of Default and of its intent to commence foreclosure or other remedies with respect to Collateral (the “Standstill Period”), the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will be permitted to pursue foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral after the end of the Standstill Period. _Exercise of Remedies and Certain Other Provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement_ Subject to the Standstill Period defined above in “—Foreclosure and Application of Proceeds,”prior to payment in full of all of the Equal Priority Obligations (and termination of related commitments), the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties will have the exclusive right to exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral, to exercise and enforce all privileges and rights thereunder according to their discretion and the exercise of their good faith business judgment, including, without limitation, the exclusive right to take or retake control or possession of any Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, process, sell, lease, dispose of, or liquidate any Collateral. Notwithstanding any rights or remedies available to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or the Junior Priority Secured Parties under Applicable Law or otherwise, prior to the expiration of the Standstill Period, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties will not be permitted to, directly or indirectly, seek to foreclose or realize upon (judicially or non-judicially) their Lien on, or otherwise exercise any rights or remedies with respect to, any Collateral (including, without limitation, by setoff or notification of account debtors). The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will not (i) preclude the Junior Priority Collateral Agent from exercising certain actions that would be permitted to be taken as unsecured creditors against the Company or any Guarantor, and except in any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, as necessary to file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Priority Obligations and in certain other limited situations, or (ii) prohibit the receipt by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party of regularly scheduled payments of principal of, and regularly scheduled payments of interest on, the Junior Priority Obligations, as the case may be, but in each case of clause (i) and (ii), subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations as will be more fully set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Following the acceleration of any Equal Priority Obligations (the “Purchase Event”), within 30 days of the Purchase Event, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and Junior Priority Secured Parties will have the option, by notice to the representative of the Equal Priority Secured Parties, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Equal Priority Obligations in full in cash. The Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will also, among other things: (1) with respect to the Collateral, provide that so long as any Equal Priority Obligations are outstanding, only the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties will have the right to restrict or permit, or approve, the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Collateral in connection with an enforcement of remedies against such Collateral; (2) so long as the Equal Priority Obligations are outstanding, prohibit the grant of additional Liens in favor of the Junior Priority Collateral Agent on any property or assets of the Company and the Guarantors to the extent the Collateral Agents for the Equal Priority Obligations have not been granted a Lien on such property and assets; (3) provide that in the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral, the Liens granted to the Junior Priority Representatives and the Junior Priority Secured Parties ----- upon such Collateral to secure Junior Priority Obligations will terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Equal Priority Obligations; (4) provide that if the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party holds or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Company or any Guarantor securing any Junior Priority Obligations that are not also subject to the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations under the Equal Priority Obligations Documents, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or such Junior Priority Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Company or Guarantor shall promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Controlling Collateral Agent as security for the Equal Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Senior Priority Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior Lien on such assets or property subject to the terms of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Senior Priority Collateral Agents, will be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Senior Priority Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Priority Secured Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (5) provide that if any Equal Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Company or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Equal Priority Obligations will be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Equal Priority Secured Parties will be entitled to a future discharge of Equal Priority Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement will be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Junior Priority Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Priority Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (6) provide that, upon any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving either the Company or any Guarantor, the Junior Priority Collateral Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties: (A) shall not raise any objection to (i) the use of cash collateral by either the Company or any Guarantor if permitted (or not objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party or (ii) either the Company or any Guarantor obtaining DIP Financing if permitted (or not objected to) by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party and to the extent the Liens securing any Equal Priority Obligations are subordinated to or have the same priority as the Liens securing such DIP Financing, will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) its Liens in the Collateral to (x) the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, (y) any adequate protection Liens provided to the Equal Priority Secured Parties and (z) any “carve-out” agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent or as otherwise specified in the financing order relating to the DIP Financing, (B) will not request adequate protection or other relief in connection with any such use of cash collateral or any such DIP Financing; provided that the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or the Junior Priority Secured Parties shall be permitted to (i) seek adequate protection in the form of ----- additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or additional or replacement collateral to secure the Junior Priority Obligations as long as, in each case, the Equal Priority Secured Parties are also granted such additional or replacement Liens on the Collateral or additional or replacement collateral and such Liens that secure the Junior Priority Obligations shall rank junior to and be subordinated to the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the DIP Financing on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the DIP Financing rank to the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) if the Equal Priority Secured Parties or the providers of a DIP Financing are granted adequate protection in the form of a super-priority administrative expense claim, seek and receive adequate protection of its junior interest in the Collateral in form of a superpriority administrative expense claim; provided, however, that any such super-priority administrative expense claim of the Junior Priority Collateral Agent shall rank junior and be subordinated to any super-priority administrative expense claim granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties and the providers of the DIP Financing with respect to such Collateral, (C) will not contest (or support any other Person in contesting) (x) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties for adequate protection, (y) any objection made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or insolvency or liquidation proceeding claiming a lack of adequate protection or (z) the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts of any Equal Priority Secured Party under Section 506(b) or Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable insolvency law, (D) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of Equal Priority Obligations made by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Parties, and, so long as Equal Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not seek (or support any person in seeking) any such relief in respect of the Collateral without the consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, (E) will raise no objection to (or otherwise contest) any lawful exercise by any Equal Priority Secured Party of the right to credit bid Equal Priority Obligations at any sale in foreclosure of Collateral, (F) will raise no objection to (and will not otherwise contest) any order relating to a sale of assets of the Company or Guarantors for which the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented (or not objected to) that provides, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations rank relative to the Liens securing the Junior Priority Obligations in accordance with the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, and (G) so long as Equal Priority Obligations are outstanding, will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the United States Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral; (7) provide that the Junior Priority Collateral Agent will not contest, protest or object to any lien enforcement action or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Parties or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Parties of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral under the Equal Priority Obligations Documents or otherwise and has no right to direct the Controlling Collateral Agent to take any foreclosure or other action; (8) provide that no Junior Priority Representative or any other Junior Priority Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any proposed plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with or in violation of the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent ----- any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under the law applicable to such plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan); and (9) provide that each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Priority Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Priority Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Priority Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Priority Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Company and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Priority Secured Parties)), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, fees, expenses and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Priority Obligations, with each Junior Priority Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Priority Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Priority Secured Parties. If the Company incurs additional Equal Priority Obligations or additional Junior Priority Obligations that are not prohibited by the provisions of the Equal Priority Obligations Documents and the Junior Priority Obligations Documents, as applicable, (1) any such additional Equal Priority Obligations may be secured by a Lien having Senior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Senior Priority Representative with respect to such additional Equal Priority Obligations executes and delivers a joinder to the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or other Customary Intercreditor Agreement of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof and the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Equal Priority Obligations are permitted under the Equal Priority Obligations Documents, and (2) any such additional Junior Priority Obligations may be secured by a Lien having Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral if the Junior Priority Representative with respect to such additional Junior Priority Obligations executes and delivers a joinder to the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or other Customary Intercreditor Agreement of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof and the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate stating that the additional Junior Priority Obligations are permitted under the Equal Priority Obligations Documents and the Junior Priority Obligations Documents. The Controlling Collateral Agent, any other Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and applicable Junior Priority Collateral Agent may enter into one or more additional Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreements or other Customary Intercreditor Agreements of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof in connection with the incurrence of additional Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral having, or intending to have, a Junior Lien Priority ranking relative to the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes Obligations. The Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee shall execute any such intercreditor agreement upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by the Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied. Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Priority Obligations Document may be amended, restated, renewed, replaced or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no indebtedness under the Junior Priority Obligations Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing, or the terms of such new Junior Priority Obligations Document, would contravene the provisions of the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement or ----- other Customary Intercreditor Agreement of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof and the Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall include reciprocal provisions with respect to Equal Priority Obligations Documents. In the event that the Senior Priority Collateral Agent and/or the Equal Priority Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the Senior Priority Security Documents for the purpose of adding to or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any such Senior Priority Security Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Senior Priority Collateral Agent, the Equal Priority Secured Parties, the Company or any Guarantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens on Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable Junior Priority Security Document without the consent of or action by the Junior Priority Collateral Agent or any Junior Priority Secured Party; _provided, however, that (x) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of (i) removing assets_ subject to the Lien of any Junior Priority Security Document, except to the extent that a release of such Lien is provided for in the Junior Priority Obligations Documents or (ii) imposing duties that are materially adverse on (including by eliminating protections of) any Junior Priority Representative (without their consent) or (iii) altering the terms of the Junior Priority Obligations Documents to permit other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms of the Junior Priority Obligations Documents and (y) written notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall have been given to the Junior Priority Collateral Agent within 10 Business Days after the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or consent.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the Holders to realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to certain Bankruptcy Law limitations as described below.

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code or an administration of the UK Co-Issuer or a Guarantor incorporated in England and Wales, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent and the Controlling Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing or otherwise exercising its rights over assets of a debtor (including Collateral), or from disposing of security without the applicable court approval, which may not be given or could be materially delayed, depending on the circumstances. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the broad scope of the automatic stay that is triggered upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case under the Bankruptcy Code, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent or Controlling Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders would receive any distribution or payment on account of their Notes or would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’ fees and expenses to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral exceeds the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not _control decisions regarding the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Furthermore, in the event a U.S. or non-U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send written notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of _Control,”and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted_ for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is transmitted electronically or mailed (the “Change of Control _Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a_ Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the Change of Control Offer is commenced (or such later time and date as the Issuers decide in their sole discretion) (such time and date, the “withdrawal deadline”), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased and any other information as may be required by the paying agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC; (7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of ----- the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all applicable conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuers shall determine that the Change of Control will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date). The Senior Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers become party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the _funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required_ ----- _by the Indentures, and the change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. A transaction that is a “Permitted Change of Control” is defined to be excluded from the definition of “Change of Control.” Restricted Payments in connection with or in order to consummate a Permitted Change of Control will be permitted under the Indenture. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and _Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_ waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under Applicable Law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuers or any third party approved in writing by the Issuers that are making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to Applicable Law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. ----- The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless, prior to, or concurrently with, the time the Issuers are required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below), the Issuers have previously or concurrently mailed or transmitted electronically a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in ----- cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Company may determine (such Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, if any, to but excluding the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send written notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of _Control,”and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted_ for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is transmitted electronically or mailed (the “Change of Control _Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a_ Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the Change of Control Offer is commenced (or such later time and date as the Issuers decide in their sole discretion) (such time and date, the “withdrawal deadline”), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased and any other information as may be required by the paying agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC; (7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all applicable conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuers shall determine that the Change of Control will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow. ----- On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date). The Senior Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers become party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement and/or such other agreement being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the _funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by the Indentures, and the change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and _Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_ waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the ----- Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under Applicable Law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuers or any third party approved in writing by the Issuers that are making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to Applicable Law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.14,Repurchase at the Option of Holders,59.14.2,Asset Sales,"The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company (including by way of relief from or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with such Asset Sale) at the time of contractually agreeing to such sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, (a) at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) or (b) at least 50% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), in each case, received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. Within 540 days after the later of (x) the date of any such Asset Sale and (y) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any such Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Applicable Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”), (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under the Notes (which for avoidance of doubt, may be made by redemption or open-market purchases); (b) Equal Priority Obligations other than the Notes (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that if the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any Equal Priority Obligations other than the Notes, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations by either redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or by purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon; or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; (2) other than in connection with an Asset Sale described under clause (2)(b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) Capital Expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets or other investment in the business of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), either (i) are used or useful in a Similar Business or (ii) replace in whole or in part the businesses or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided, further, that the Company may elect to deem any Investment, Capital Expenditure, acquisition or investment within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), as applicable, that occurs prior to the receipt of the Applicable Proceeds from such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this clause (2) (it being agreed that such deemed Investment, Capital Expenditure, acquisition or investment shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) notice of such Asset Sale, (y) execution of a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable, and (z) consummation of such Asset Sale); or (3) any combination of the foregoing excluding, in the case of an Asset Sale described under clause 2(b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, the immediately preceding clause (2); _provided that, in the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application_ of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such Restricted ----- Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within the later of (x) 180 days of such commitment and (y) 540 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale (an “Acceptable Commitment”); and in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds after the later of (A) 540 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale and (B) the termination of such Acceptable Commitment (unless another Acceptable Commitment is entered into with respect thereto prior to such later date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the repatriation or expatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sales by an Exempt Entity would have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation or expatriation) or any such Applicable Proceeds are prohibited, delayed, restricted or subject to limitation by applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority from being repatriated or expatriated to the United Kingdom or United States or distributed to the Issuers or any Guarantor that is not an Exempt Entity, the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Exempt Entity so long, but only so long, as applicable, as such material adverse tax consequence exists or the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority will not permit repatriation or expatriation to the United Kingdom or United States or distribution to the Issuers or any Guarantor (the Issuers hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Exempt Entity to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree, determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation, expatriation or distribution), and if such repatriation or expatriation of any of such affected Applicable Proceeds, as applicable, no longer has material adverse tax consequences or is permitted under the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority, such repatriation or expatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated or expatriated Applicable Proceeds will be applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation or expatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant. Any Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds an aggregate of the greater of (x) £130.0 million and (y) 15.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuers shall make an offer to all Holders and, if and to the extent required by the terms of any other Equal Priority Obligations, to the holders of such Equal Priority Obligations (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Equal Priority Obligations that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased in the amount equal to the sum of the Excess Proceeds (the “Excess Proceeds Payment Amount”) at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Equal Priority Obligations. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Equal Priority Obligations Documents and/or the Indenture, as applicable, with a copy to the Trustee, in the case of the Indenture. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to all or a portion of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Equal Priority Obligations tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds Payment Amount (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for such amount offered in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Equal Priority Obligations surrendered by such Holders and holders thereof exceeds the ----- amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the Notes, the Equal Priority Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount or accreted value of the Notes or such Equal Priority Obligations tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes, the Equal Priority Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, but in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of the Applicable Proceeds the Issuers are offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply such Applicable Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Agreement) or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to make an Investment, Capital Expenditures or acquisitions of other assets or other investments prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Sale, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant with respect to such Asset Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder of any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds may apply any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and such Retained Asset Sale Proceeds shall in no event and under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds. For purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be Cash Equivalents: (1) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto, or if incurred or accrued or increased or decreased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual or increase or decrease had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Company) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the payment in cash on the Notes, that are assumed by the transferee (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) with respect to the applicable Asset Sale (or are otherwise extinguished, cancelled or terminated in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) and for which the Company and all Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing; (2) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and (3) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (3) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) £215.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value. To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in pounds sterling that is actually received by the Issuers upon converting such portion into pounds sterling. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each ----- repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In complying with these requirements, the Issuers may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC would not recommend enforcement action in relation to tender offers satisfying certain criteria. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company (including by way of relief from or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with such Asset Sale) at the time of contractually agreeing to such sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, (a) at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) or (b) at least 50% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), in each case, received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. Within 540 days after the later of (x) the date of any such Asset Sale and (y) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any such Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Applicable Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”), (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under the Senior Secured Notes or other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor that is secured by a Lien, which Lien is permitted by the Indenture and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; ----- (c) Obligations under other Senior Indebtedness (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that that, in the case of this clause (c), the Company shall either (i) equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or by purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (ii) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes, on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness, for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be repurchased (which offer shall be deemed an Asset Sale Offer for purposes of the Indenture); or (d) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; (2) other than in connection with an Asset Sale described under clause (2)(b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) Capital Expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets or other investment in the business of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), either (i) are used or useful in a Similar Business or (ii) replace in whole or in part the businesses or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided, further, that the Company may elect to deem any Investment, Capital Expenditure, acquisition or investment within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), as applicable, that occurs prior to the receipt of the Applicable Proceeds from such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this clause (2) (it being agreed that such deemed Investment, Capital Expenditure, acquisition or investment shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) notice of such Asset Sale, (y) execution of a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable, and (z) consummation of such Asset Sale); or (3) any combination of the foregoing excluding, in the case of an Asset Sale described under clause 2(b) of the immediately preceding paragraph, the immediately preceding clause (2); _provided that, in the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application_ of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within the later of (x) 180 days of such commitment and (y) 540 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale (an “Acceptable Commitment”); and in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds after the later of (A) 540 days after the date of the applicable Asset Sale and (B) the termination of such Acceptable Commitment (unless another Acceptable Commitment is entered into with respect thereto prior to such later date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the repatriation or expatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sales by an Exempt Entity would have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation or expatriation) or any such Applicable Proceeds are prohibited, delayed, restricted or subject to limitation by applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority from being repatriated or expatriated to the United Kingdom or United States or distributed to the Issuers or any Guarantor that is not an Exempt Entity, the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Exempt Entity so long, but only so long, as applicable, as such material adverse tax consequence exists or the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority will not permit repatriation or expatriation to the United Kingdom or United States or distribution to the Issuers or any Guarantor (the Issuers hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Exempt Entity to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree, determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation, expatriation or distribution), and if such ----- repatriation or expatriation of any of such affected Applicable Proceeds, as applicable, no longer has material adverse tax consequences or is permitted under the applicable local law, rule, regulation, order, decree or determination of any arbitrator, court or governmental authority, such repatriation or expatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated or expatriated Applicable Proceeds will be applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation or expatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant. Any Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds an aggregate of the greater of (x) £130.0 million and (y) 15.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuers shall make an offer to all Holders and, if and to the extent required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is _pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu_ Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased in the amount equal to the sum of the Excess Proceeds (the “Excess Proceeds Payment Amount”) at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, as applicable, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to all or a portion of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds Payment Amount (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for such amount offered in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such Holders and holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall select the Notes, the Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount or accreted value of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes, the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, but in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of the Applicable Proceeds the Issuers are offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that any portion of Applicable Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in pounds sterling that is actually received by the Issuers upon converting such portion into pounds sterling. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer.

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuers or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given (a) to the Issuers (with a copy to the Trustee) by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or (b) to the Issuers by the Trustee to comply with any of its or their obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after receipt of such written notice; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than any Receivables Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or pursuant to any Receivables Facility), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: ----- (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of (x) £255.0 million or more and (y) 30.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) £255.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; (7) the Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason (except as contemplated by the express terms thereof or the Indenture) cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; (8) the Liens created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is not required by the Indenture, the Security Documents or Agreed Security Principles) other than (A) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Indenture, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement and any other Customary Intercreditor Agreement, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the Controlling Collateral Agent or Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security Documents and such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes; or (9) the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Security Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents). If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and Trustee, or the Trustee (which may be at the direction of the Holders) by written notice to the Issuers, may declare the principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. ----- Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest, and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee and the Issuers may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer)) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes, provided that such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security reasonably satisfactory to each of them against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or any other Customary Intercreditor Agreement, except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Note. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (or refrain from ----- taking any other action) (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing _Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuers and the_ Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuers (with a copy to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable) with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee (after delivery to the Trustee of appropriate confirmation of beneficial ownership satisfactory to the Trustee), and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any duty, obligation or responsibility to confirm, verify or investigate any Position Representation or Verification Covenant and, unless notified by the Issuers, shall be entitled, without liability, to assume that the Position Representation is accurate and that any requested Verification Covenant has been provided and is accurate. In no instance shall the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent be required to calculate, confirm or verify that any beneficial owner is Net Short. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder providing such Noteholder Direction was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. Upon receipt of such Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee will be instructed to immediately cease, and shall not take, any action in accordance with the applicable Noteholder Direction and shall not incur any liability whatsoever to any Person pending the final and non-appealable determination of the court. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity or security such Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a voluntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding (as set forth in paragraph 6 under “Events of Default _and Remedies”) shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. In addition, for the avoidance of_ doubt, the requirements described in the preceding two paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank, and shall only apply to Noteholder Directions as defined herein and not to any other direction given to the Trustee under the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely (without liability) on any Noteholder Direction and Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the ----- Indenture, regardless of whether such Noteholder Direction is later challenged by the Issuer, shall have no duty to inquire as to, or investigate, the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuers, any Holder, any beneficial owner or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate issued in connection therewith. With their acquisition of the Notes, each Noteholder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuers in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that each Noteholder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with the Indenture, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction or an Officer’s Certificate issued in connection therewith. The Indenture will also provide that the Issuers will waive any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with the Indenture, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction or an Officer’s Certificate issued in connection therewith. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee will treat all Holders equally with respect to their rights described under the Indenture, and in connection with the requisite percentages required under the Indenture, that the Trustee will also treat all outstanding Notes equally irrespective of any Position Representation in determining whether the requisite percentage has been obtained with respect to the initial delivery of the Noteholder Direction. Subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any other Customary Intercreditor Agreement and certain other restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any request or direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such direction is unduly prejudicial to such Holders) or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture will provide that the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required, within 30 days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default, its status and the actions that the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period). The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under “—Reports and Other Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”: ----- (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuers or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given (a) to the Issuers (with a copy to the Trustee) by the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or (b) to the Issuers by the Trustee to comply with any of its or their obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after receipt of such written notice; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than any Receivables Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or pursuant to any Receivables Facility), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of (x) £255.0 million or more and (y) 30.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) £255.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; or (7) the Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason (except as contemplated by the express terms thereof or the Indenture) cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and Trustee, or the Trustee (which may be at the direction of the Holders) by written notice to the Issuers, may declare the principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. ----- Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest, and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is actually known to a responsible officer of the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee and the Issuers may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer)) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes, provided that such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or security reasonably satisfactory to each of the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Note. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (or refrain from taking any other action) (a “Noteholder _Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a_ written representation from each such Holder to the Issuers and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the ----- case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuers (with a copy to the Trustee) with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification _Covenant”).

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a voluntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding (as set forth in paragraph 6 under “Events of Default and Remedies”) shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph.

The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuers, any Holder, any ----- beneficial owner or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate issued in connection therewith. With their acquisition of the Notes, each Noteholder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuers in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

(d) Whenever pro forma effect or a determination of pro forma compliance is to be given to a Subject Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by an Officer of the Company and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of run rate benefits related to “run rate” initiatives projected by the Company in good faith to result from or relating to any Subject Transaction that is being given pro forma effect or for which a determination of pro forma compliance is being made that have been realized or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such run rate benefits have been taken or initiated, have been committed to be taken or initiated, with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or initiated or which are expected to be taken or initiated (in the good faith determination of the Company) (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such run rate benefits had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such run rate benefits were realized during the entirety of such period and “run rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken or initiated, any action committed to be taken or initiated, any action with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or initiated or any action that is expected to be taken or initiated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions, and any such run rate benefits shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests and during any subsequent Applicable Measurement Period in which the effects thereof are expected to be realized) relating to such Subject Transaction, and any such run rate benefits included in the initial _pro forma calculations shall continue to apply to subsequent calculations of such financial ratios or tests,_ including during any subsequent Applicable Measurement Periods in which the effects thereof are expected to be realizable; provided that (A) such run rate benefits are reasonably identifiable in the good faith judgment of the Company, (B) such actions are taken or initiated, such actions are committed to be taken or initiated, substantial steps with respect to such action have been taken or initiated or such actions are expected to be taken or initiated no later than twelve fiscal quarters after the date of consummation of the Transactions or such Subject Transaction or the date of initiation of any Subject Transaction and (C) no run rate benefits shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a _pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period._ (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this “Description of the Notes”), when calculating any financial metric or ratio, the financial definitions or component thereof, the Company shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure) or any other changes in the applicable accounting principles, provided that the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) (or any equivalent measure) is either excluded or included. (f) In the event that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantee) or refinances (including by redemption, repurchase, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness (other than normal fluctuations in revolving Indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes), in each case included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test, (i) during the Applicable Measurement Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the Applicable Measurement Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test that is to be calculated on a pro forma basis shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or refinancing of Indebtedness (including pro forma effect to the application of the net proceeds therefrom), in each case to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the Applicable Measurement Period (except in the case of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (or similar ratio), in which case such incurrence or refinancing of Indebtedness will be given effect, as if the same had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period). (g) If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which ----- the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any interest hedging agreements applicable to such Indebtedness). To the extent interest expense generated by Hedging Obligations that have been terminated is included in Consolidated Interest Expense prior to the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being made, Consolidated Interest Expense shall be adjusted to exclude such expense. Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate. For purposes of making the computations referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if lower, the maximum commitments under such revolving credit facility as of the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being made, except as set forth in paragraph (d) above. (h) For purposes hereof, the “maximum fixed repurchase price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which Consolidated Total Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, such fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the Board or senior management of such Person. (i) Any such pro forma calculation may include, without limitation, (i) all adjustments of the type described in the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such Applicable Measurement Period, and (ii) any other adjustments calculated in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. (j) For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any Fixed Amount, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA, Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA), such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence- Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to “—Limited Condition _Transactions” above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the_ case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be. (k) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including any covenant and including but not limited to amounts incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,”) that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test_ (including Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the “Fixed _Amounts”) substantially concurrently, simultaneously or contemporaneously with any amounts incurred_ or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and including but not limited to amounts incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) (any such amounts, the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is_ ----- understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts. (l) If any financial ratio, calculation, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement that is to be calculated by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (a “numerical _permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA and/or total assets (a “grower permission”) and_ the grower permission of such metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or Investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. (m) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on an Incurrence-Based Amount, such Incurrence-Based Amount shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (i) immediately prior to, substantially concurrently, simultaneously, contemporaneously with or in connection therewith or (ii) used to finance working capital needs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as reasonably determined by the Company). (n) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, so long as an action was taken (or not taken) in reliance upon a basket, ratio or test under the Indenture that was calculated or determined in good faith by an Officer of the Company based upon financial information available to such officer at such time and such action (or inaction) was permitted under the Indenture at the time of such calculation or determination, any subsequent restatement, modification or adjustments made to such financial information (including any restatement, modification or adjustment that would have caused such basket, ratio or test to be exceeded as a result of such action or inaction) shall not result in any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. (o) For purposes of determining compliance at any time with the covenants under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” “—Certain Covenants— Transactions with Affiliates” and the definitions of “Permitted Investments” and “Permitted Liens,” in_ the event that any Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition or Affiliate Transaction, as applicable, meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of transactions or items permitted pursuant to the first paragraph or any clause of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock _and Preferred Stock” (provided that all Indebtedness represented by term loans outstanding under the_ Senior Credit Agreement (after giving effect to the Transactions) on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”); provided_ that the foregoing will not be deemed to limit the classification or reclassification of amounts incurred between or among subclauses (a) and (b) of such clause (1)), any clause of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” clause (3) of the first paragraph or any clause of the second paragraph under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any clause of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” any clause of_ the definition of “Permitted Investment,”any clause of the definition of “Asset Sale”and any dispositions constituting exceptions thereto and any clause under “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates,” the Company, in its sole discretion, may, from time to time, classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any one category; provided that the reclassification described in this sentence shall be deemed to have occurred automatically with respect to any such transaction or item incurred or made pursuant to a Fixed Amount that later would be permitted on a pro forma basis to be incurred or made pursuant to an Incurrence-Based Amount. It is understood and agreed that any Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction need not be ----- permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Indebtedness, Permitted Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, disposition and/or Affiliate Transaction under such sections, respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof. (p) For purposes of any determination under the Indenture with respect to: (i) any Applicable Metric in a specified currency (other than in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Indenture or related usage, ratchet or permission), the equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Calculation Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange hedging permitted under the Indenture in respect of currency exchange risks); or (ii) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Indenture), the specified currency-equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the Company’s option, using any of: (A) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant testing period; (B) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; (C) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Calculation Date, if applicable); or (D) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group; and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the specified currency-equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates. (q) Without prejudice to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company may, from time to time, by notice to the Trustee, redenominate any Applicable Metric denominated in a particular currency into any other particular currency (as the Company may elect) by reference to any rate referred to in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph and, on and from the date of such notice, such Applicable Metric shall for all purposes be construed as being denominated in such currency specified by the Company in the amount determined by the Company in accordance with this paragraph. (r) For purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” such Person may elect, pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee, to treat all or_ any portion of the commitment (such amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Elected _Amount”) under any Indebtedness which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or_ secured by such Lien (whether by the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries or any third party), as the case may be, as being incurred or secured, as the case may be, as of the date of determination and (i) any subsequent incurrence of such Indebtedness under such commitment that was so treated (so long as the total amount under such Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence of additional Indebtedness or an additional Lien at such subsequent time, (ii) such Person may revoke an election of an Elected Amount pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding. (s) For all purposes under the Indenture, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (i) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (ii) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the succeeding paragraphs (i) and (j) in this section and “—Limited Condition Transactions” above, financial ratios, calculations and tests (including measurements of baskets and other calculations calculated on the basis of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Net Income, Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charges and any Fixed Amount or Incurrence-Based Amount), including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio and Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this section (“—Certain Compliance Determinations”). In addition, whenever a financial ratio, calculation, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement is to be calculated on a pro forma basis or requires pro forma compliance, the reference to an “Applicable Measurement Period” for purposes of calculating such financial ratio or test shall be deemed to be a reference to, and shall be based on, the most recently ended Applicable Measurement Period and may be determined with reference to the financial information of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Company (as determined in good faith by the Board or senior management of the Issuers (or any Parent Entity)). ----- (b) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio, calculation, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement that is to be calculated on a pro forma basis (including measurements of baskets and other calculations on the basis of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Net Income, Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA or Fixed Charges and any Fixed Amount or Incurrence-Based Amount), the Transactions or any other Subject Transaction (with any incurrence or refinancing of any Indebtedness in connection therewith to be subject to paragraph (d) of this section) that has been made (i) during the Applicable Measurement Period or (ii) subsequent to such Applicable Measurement Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Subject Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to the Transactions or any other Subject Transactions) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period (or, in the case of Consolidated Total Assets or cash and Cash equivalents, on the last day of the Applicable Measurement Period). If, since the beginning of any Applicable Measurement Period, any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Applicable Measurement Period shall have made any Subject Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this section, then such financial ratio, calculation, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement (including measurements of baskets and other calculations on the basis of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA or Fixed Charges and any Fixed Amount or Incurrence-Based Amount) shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this section. (c) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio, calculation, covenant, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement (including any financial definition or component thereof and any financial ratio, test, basket or threshold or permission based on the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio), any Default, Event of Default or other relevant breach of the Indenture that is to be calculated by reference to a calendar year, a fiscal year, an Applicable Measurement Period, a twelve-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”and any such financial ratio, calculation, test or any other similar or related term, concept or measurement, an “Applicable Metric”): (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (1) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Company during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (2) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (c)(i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (1) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (2) secondly, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (c)(i) above; and (3) thirdly, against the Carry Back Amount. (d) Whenever pro forma effect or a determination of pro forma compliance is to be given to a Subject Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by an Officer of the Company and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of run rate benefits related to “run rate” initiatives projected by the Company in good faith to result from or relating to any Subject Transaction that is being given pro forma effect or for which a determination of pro forma compliance is being made that have been realized or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such run rate benefits have been taken or initiated, have been committed to be taken or initiated, with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or initiated or which are expected to be taken or initiated (in the good faith determination of the Company) (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such run rate benefits had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such run rate benefits were realized during the entirety of such period and “run rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken or initiated, any action committed to be taken or initiated, any action with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or initiated or any action that is expected to be ----- taken or initiated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions, and any such run rate benefits shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests and during any subsequent Applicable Measurement Period in which the effects thereof are expected to be realized) relating to such Subject Transaction, and any such run rate benefits included in the initial _pro forma calculations shall continue to apply to subsequent calculations of such financial ratios or tests,_ including during any subsequent Applicable Measurement Periods in which the effects thereof are expected to be realizable; provided that (A) such run rate benefits are reasonably identifiable in the good faith judgment of the Company, (B) such actions are taken or initiated, such actions are committed to be taken or initiated, substantial steps with respect to such action have been taken or initiated or such actions are expected to be taken or initiated no later than twelve fiscal quarters after the date of consummation of the Transactions or such Subject Transaction or the date of initiation of any Subject Transaction and (C) no run rate benefits shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a _pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period._ (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this “Description of the Notes”), when calculating any financial metric or ratio, the financial definitions or component thereof, the Company shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and, in each case, any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure) or any other changes in the applicable accounting principles, provided that the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) (or any equivalent measure) is either excluded or included. (f) In the event that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantee) or refinances (including by redemption, repurchase, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness (other than normal fluctuations in revolving Indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes), in each case included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test, (i) during the Applicable Measurement Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the Applicable Measurement Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test that is to be calculated on a pro forma basis shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or refinancing of Indebtedness (including pro forma effect to the application of the net proceeds therefrom), in each case to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the Applicable Measurement Period (except in the case of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (or similar ratio), in which case such incurrence or refinancing of Indebtedness will be given effect, as if the same had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period). (g) If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any interest hedging agreements applicable to such Indebtedness). To the extent interest expense generated by Hedging Obligations that have been terminated is included in Consolidated Interest Expense prior to the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being made, Consolidated Interest Expense shall be adjusted to exclude such expense. Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by an Officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate. For purposes of making the computations referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if lower, the maximum commitments under such revolving credit facility as of the date of the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being made, except as set forth in paragraph (d) above. (h) For purposes hereof, the “maximum fixed repurchase price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with the ----- terms of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which Consolidated Total Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, such fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the Board or senior management of such Person. (i) Any such pro forma calculation may include, without limitation, (i) all adjustments of the type described in the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such Applicable Measurement Period, and (ii) any other adjustments calculated in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. (j) For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any Fixed Amount, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA, Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA), such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence- Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to “—Limited Condition _Transactions” above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the_ case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be. (k) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including any covenant and including but not limited to amounts incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,”) that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test_ (including Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the “Fixed _Amounts”) substantially concurrently, simultaneously or contemporaneously with any amounts incurred_ or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and including but not limited to amounts incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) (any such amounts, the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is_ understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts.

614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.1,England and Wales,214.1.1,,"Certain guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (each, an “English company”). Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts While the UK was a member state of the European Union, insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (“EU Recast Insolvency Regulation”) and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (as amended) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation continue to apply to the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English companies would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English company has its “center of main interests” (“COMI”) in a member state of the European Union (a “Member State”), insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant Member State and be subject to the laws of that Member Sate. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English company which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such ----- a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non- transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-Border Recognition of _English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings” below)._ English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the notes are guaranteed by the note guarantees and secured by security interests over the collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the issuers in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the issuer, of a notes guarantee against an English company and of the security interests over the collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the issuer, under the notes guarantees and/or under the collateral securing the notes and the notes guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company. As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company should be commenced in England based on English insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of English companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application for an administration order, (ii) the company, its directors, or certain creditors (discussed below) appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor filing a petition to wind-up the English company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation) (see “—No winding up petitions or orders” below). An English company may be wound up, among other reasons, if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (as described below). Under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act, a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (which is deemed to be the case if, among other things, it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, if the company fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 3 weeks of service or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order)) or “balance sheet” basis (i.e., it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Administration The Insolvency Act empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of any company within their general jurisdiction (see “Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts” above), any company incorporated in England, Wales or an EEA State, any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the UK or certain other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration, which must be one of the statutory objectives (described below). ----- An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the person making the appointment. To constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provisions apply to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator in respect of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The holder of the qualifying floating charge may appoint an administrator if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. During the administration, in general, no resolution may be passed, and no order may be made, for the winding up of the debtor and no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with permission of the court or the consent of the administrator. Accordingly, if any of the English companies were to enter into administration, the notes, the notes guarantees and the collateral, as applicable, may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company is in administration. There can be no assurance that the Notes Collateral Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “FCARs”). It is likely, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, that the security granted by an English company may not be enforced while it is in administration. The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary objective); (2) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the secondary objective); or (3) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the tertiary objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the tertiary objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the primary objective or the secondary objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the tertiary objective. Administrative Receivership In order to empower the Notes Collateral Agent to appoint an administrative receiver to an English company, a qualifying floating charge for purposes of English insolvency law must be granted by the relevant English ----- company and the qualifying floating charge must, unless the relevant security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions set out in Sections 72B–72GA of the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The Notes Collateral Agent would only be able to apply to appoint an administrative receiver over an English company if the security interests granted in the assets that constitute collateral on the settlement date fall within one of the exceptions. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “Transactions at an undervalue,” “Preference” and “Avoidance of certain floating charges” below, respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office. Fixed charge receivership A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges, see “—Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute. If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the FCARs. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Priority on Claims”). Liquidation / Winding-up Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company (to the extent that they are not subject to any fixed security interest) are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act. At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The difference between the two voluntary liquidation proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company must swear a statutory declaration that the company will be able to pay its debts in full, together with any ----- applicable interest, within a period not exceeding 12 months from the commencement of the winding up. In comparison, the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts. Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’general jurisdiction (see “Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of _the English Courts” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies_ registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”under the FCARs and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power, among other things, to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of Transactions” below). Under English insolvency law, a liquidator also has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving a prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up. Company voluntary arrangement English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies incorporated in England, Wales or an EEA State or with their respective COMI in the UK or a Member State (other than Denmark). Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement ----- cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to nonpreferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted in favor of the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail. Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings. Scheme of Arrangement A scheme of arrangement is a court approved compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or members. Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Companies Act”), the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or arrangement with respect to a company’s liabilities where such company (i) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act; and (ii) has “sufficient connection” to the jurisdiction of the English courts. In practice, any company is likely to satisfy the first limb of such test and the English courts have concluded that the second limb of such test has been satisfied where, among other circumstances, the company’s COMI is in England and Wales or the company’s finance documents are governed by English law and contain a clause providing for the submission to the jurisdiction of the English courts. Schemes of arrangement can be utilized by companies to provide for a modification or adjustment of the rights of the company’s creditors or members which, if approved by the requisite majorities of creditors or members and sanctioned by the court, will be binding on all creditors or members within the relevant class. In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before either type of scheme will become effective it must be approved by a majority in number, representing at least 75% in value of the affected class(es) of members and/or creditors (as applicable), present and voting at a duly convened meeting pursuant to an order of the court; and be sanctioned at a subsequent hearing by the court. In determining whether to sanction a scheme, the court will consider whether the terms of the statute have been complied with, whether the class(es) affected by the scheme were fairly represented by those who attended the relevant meeting(s) and whether the arrangement as a whole is such as an intelligent and honest person, being a member of the class concerned and acting with respect to their interest, might reasonably approve. A members’ scheme will typically involve a restructuring of the rights of a company’s members. Once approved, the scheme will be binding on all members (including dissenting members) or, if applicable, the whole class of members whose rights were affected by the scheme. A creditors’ scheme may involve (among other things) a proposal to defer, compromise, extinguish or replace the company’s debts. Once sanctioned and filed with Companies House, the scheme will be binding on all affected creditors, including any dissenting scheme creditors. Schemes are extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement substantially any arrangement relating to the rights of members or creditors against the company, including secured creditors. A debtor’s decision to propose a scheme of arrangement will not automatically give rise to a stay or moratorium on proceedings against that debtor or its property. However, the court has previously exercised its inherent discretion to grant a stay on proceedings to allow a scheme to be implemented. Restructuring Plan A restructuring plan is a procedure under Part 26A of the Companies Act which allows the English courts to effect a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or members (or any class of creditors ----- or members), similar to a scheme but with the added possibility of a “cross-class cram-down.”While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors or members (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby the proponents of a proposed restructuring plan (either the debtor company, any creditor or member of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company) must first apply to court for directions to summon one or more meetings of creditors or members (or classes of either category) to consider the restructuring plan. At that first hearing (referred to as the ‘convening hearing’), the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and may order that “out-of-the-money”creditors and members (i.e., those shown not have a genuine economic interest in the company) do not need to be permitted to participate in the proposed meetings. The general rule is that creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring plan must be permitted to participate in the proposed meeting(s). If the court makes a convening order, the proposed restructuring plan will then be voted on at the relevant creditors’ or members’ meeting, and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the class(es) of creditors or members present, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Following the convened creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (1) the court is satisfied that no creditor or member in the dissenting class(es) would be worse off than they would be in the ‘relevant alternative’ i.e., what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned; and (2) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of at least one class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative mentioned in (1) above. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not, once notice is delivered to Companies House. Although previously contemplated in earlier drafts of the proposed legislation, the Act does not contain an absolute priority rule (a prominent feature of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcies), requirements relating to impaired classes or provisions requiring a particular proportion of unconnected creditors to approve the plan. As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. Moratorium Part A1 of the Insolvency Act provides for companies to seek a standalone moratorium to provide a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors may fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. ----- Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: (a) pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by ----- number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; (b) pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; (c) automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and (d) at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). Challenges to Guarantees and Security There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company or may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would be entitled to pursue it. The Issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest or guarantee in respect of the notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court will generally not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.

It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company takes the decision to enter into the transaction.

The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

A relevant time for these purposes means up to twelve months (or where the charge is created in favor of a connected person two years) before the date on which the English company enters administration or liquidation, or at a time between the issuance of an administration application and the making of an administration order on that application or at a time between the filing of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and the making of the appointment. Where the floating charge is created in favor of a person not connected with the company, it must be shown that, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction under which the charge is created, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the consideration. If the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the FCAR, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
614_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.9,Re-characterization of fixed charge,214.9.1,,"There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed charges expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed charges will be upheld as fixed charges rather than floating charges will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the company’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds therefrom and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where a company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Limitation on Enforcement The grant of a guarantee or security by any of the English companies in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the company in question is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. Under the Companies Act, any security (including security not governed by English law) granted by a company (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. In the event where the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of its creation. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset registry or companies registry applicable in the granter’s jurisdiction of incorporation). Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act. Security over bank accounts With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English company, the banks with which those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that English company. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English company) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances. ----- Security over Shares Security over shares granted by an English company or over shares of an English company are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the shares in favor of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court. Assignments Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing under the hand of the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest. PSC regime Pursuant to Part 21A of the Companies Act (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the Companies Act), certain UK incorporated companies and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “relevant company”) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the Companies Act (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the Companies Act. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the Companies Act, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the security interests over the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to enforce its rights under the English security documents. Priority of Claims One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (see “—Prescribed Part” below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual set-off arrangements in place when a company enters liquidation or distributing administration are displaced by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). ----- The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers the secured indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of the debtor; - Second ranking claims: Moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts (where liquidation / administration occurs within 12 weeks of a moratorium) - Third ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking claims: ordinary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As between one another, preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking claims: secondary preferential creditors, including the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme and HMRC debts relating to VAT, pay-as-you-earn withholding, employee NIC, student loan repayments and certain construction industry deductions; - Sixth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed Part” below). - Seventh ranking claims: unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the officeholder can only use realization from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall; and - Eighth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, with interest, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. Prescribed Part An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 where the first ranking floating charge was created on or after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before then). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. As noted above, the Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. Foreign Currency Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date (i.e., the date (i) the company went into liquidation (or, if the liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, on the date when the company entered administration); or (ii) the company went into administration (or, if the administration was immediately preceded by a winding up, on the date when the company went into liquidation)). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. A ----- creditor who considers that the rate determined by the office-holder is unreasonable may apply to court and, if the court finds that the rate is unreasonable, the court may itself determine the exchange rate to be used. Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited Section 223(b) of the Insolvency Act provides a prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses and the imposition of certain amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than on the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. To prevent undue hardship, a supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company, the relevant insolvency practitioner or the court consents. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this prohibition.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the UK, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the UK) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the UK) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. The English courts have held that a Part 26A Plan is not within the Lugano Convention, as it falls within the insolvency exclusion within the convention (by contrast to schemes of arrangement—see above). It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of other treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the Luxembourg Entity: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings, ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Luxembourg Entity, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, the enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. It is worth noting that any financial collateral security or similar arrangement under the Luxembourg law of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”) would remain outside the scope of the Luxembourg bankruptcy laws; - judicial decisions concerning judicial reorganisation proceedings (procédures de réorganisation _judiciaire). As of the time of filing of a petition for the opening of such judicial reorganisation_ proceedings (procédure de réorganisation judiciaire): (i) the rights of creditors (including certain secured creditors), other than, unless otherwise agreed in the relevant security agreement(s), creditors benefiting from security interests governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Law, which would remain outside the scope of the Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on business preservation and modernisation of bankruptcy (the “Reorganisation Law”), may be frozen; (ii) notwithstanding contrary contractual provisions, the filing of the petition for or the opening of a judicial reorganisation proceedings shall not terminate existing contracts; ----- (iii) a breach of contract by a debtor before a moratorium is granted pursuant to the Reorganisation Law shall not entitle a creditor to terminate an agreement where the debtor remedies such breach within a period of fifteen days after it has been given formal notice to do so by the creditor; and (iv) a debtor subject to judicial reorganisation proceedings may unilaterally decide to suspend performance of contractual obligations for the duration of a moratorium granted as part of such proceedings; and - reorganisation by amicable agreement (réorganisation par accord amiable), in a dialogue between the Luxembourg Entity and its creditors (at least two of them), under the supervision—or not—of a conciliator. Upon application of the debtor, the Luxembourg court may approve such an arrangement, which will become enforceable, after verifying that it allows the reorganisation of part or all of the Luxembourg Entity’s assets or activities. If approved by the court, the key benefit lies in the fact that such an arrangement will not be affected by the subsequent opening of bankruptcy, and thus the risk of clawback action during the hardening period is excluded. In addition, a noteholder’s ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the relevant Luxembourg Entity into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings. _Preferential Debts_ The Luxembourg Entity’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the entity following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: (i) certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg tax authorities, including value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; (ii) social security contributions; and (iii) remuneration owed to employees. For the avoidance of doubt, this list is not exhaustive. _General Limitations on Enforcement Resulting From Insolvency Proceedings_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of judicial decisions concerning judicial reorganisation proceedings (procédures de réorganisation _judiciaire)._ Assets in the form of shares, accounts or receivables over which a security interest has been granted and perfected will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law. In particular, pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, all collateral arrangements, in respect of assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have been granted, as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable against unsecured creditors, third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings. It should be noted that the Reorganisation Law currently contains a number of ambiguities and uncertainties and at this stage, it remains untested hence it is difficult to predict how (or if) it will be used and implemented in practice. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period”(periode suspecte), which is a maximum of six months, as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates a ----- person bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings (e.g., a suspension of payments) under Luxembourg law. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code (Code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the 10 days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code (Code de commerce), where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into on the day of the commencement of domestic or foreign winding-up proceedings or reorganisation measures or similar proceedings, but after the Court decision ruling regarding the opening of such proceedings or after such measure becomes effective, such arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code (Code de commerce), payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (Code civil) (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the Luxembourg Entity or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Luxembourg Entity’s business and assets and the Luxembourg Entity’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Luxembourg Guarantor). Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy or judicial reorganisation proceedings may be subject to Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Enforceability of Financial Collateral Arrangements According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of 8 January 2013 on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book I, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and national or foreign provisions governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements and netting agreements and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, Luxembourg law governed financial collateral arrangements, as well as the enforcement events, netting agreements and the valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, remain valid and enforceable even if entered ----- into during the hardening period against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding reorganization measures, winding up proceedings or any other similar national or foreign proceedings (save in the case of fraud). In accordance with article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the rules of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings are inapplicable where the collateral provider of financial collateral arrangement or similar security interest governed by a foreign law other than Luxembourg law, is established or resides in Luxembourg. Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees There is no published Luxembourg case law and only limited Luxembourg legal literature in connection with enforcement of guarantees granted by a Luxembourg guarantor for a company of the group (whether downstream, cross-stream or upstream guarantees). It is generally admitted that the grant of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company for the obligations of another group company shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) it must be within the corporate purpose of the guarantor as set out in its articles of association; (ii) it shall correspond to a demonstrable and commensurate corporate benefit received by the guarantor company; and (iii) the financial obligations assumed by the guarantor must not be disproportionate to the financial capacity of the guarantor. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of condition (iii) above, it is standard market practice that cross-stream and upstream guarantees granted by Luxembourg guarantors must be limited in their amount (as is the case pursuant to the Indenture), as opposed to downstream guarantees. According to the limited Luxembourg doctrine on this matter, in the event the above conditions are not met, the directors of the company may be held liable and it is only in exceptional cases in which it is demonstrated that (i) the beneficiary was aware of the ultra vires nature of the guarantee or (ii) that the guarantee was given with the intent to defraud creditors of the guarantor or (iii) the guarantee qualifies as a misuse of corporate asset (abus de bien social) that a court may void the guarantee itself. In accordance with the principle fraus omnia corrumpit, a first demand guarantee would not be enforceable under Luxembourg law if it is called upon in a manifestly abusive way by the beneficiary of the guarantee. Security Interests Considerations The Notes are secured, among other things, by several security interests governed by Luxembourg law. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the market price, where the pledged financial instruments are admitted to trading on a trading venue; ----- - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions _commerciales normales), (ii) on a trading venue on which they are admitted to trading or (iii) by way of_ a public auction; - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, trading venues and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interest or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation applies. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the enforcement of a pledge is permitted in case of an event of default as agreed between the parties, including an event of default which would not be a default of payment when due (e.g., breach of covenants or representations and warranties). Certain Preferences Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes).

This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of private international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy or statute, including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) incorporated via the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment is for multiple damages (an amount arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained), is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on any provision or rule of law designated by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of that Act as concerned with restrictive trade practices; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). ----- Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you that an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

According to such Luxembourg counsel, a valid, final, non-appealable and conclusive judgment against a guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the Notes rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, subject to the compliance with the enforcement proceedings (exequatur) as set out in Article 678 of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile) and Luxembourg case-law, being: - the judgment of the U.S. federal or state court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. federal or state court must not infringe the exclusive jurisdiction of the Luxembourg courts and there must be a real link (lien de rattachement caracterisé) between the case and the U.S. federal or state court; - the judgment of the U.S. federal or state court must not contain contradictions with an existing Luxembourg court order or does not contravene overriding mandatory provisions of Luxembourg law; - the decision of the U.S. federal or state court must not have been obtained by fraud, but in compliance with the principles of natural justice and the decision must have been granted in compliance with the rights of the defendant to appear and the right to a fair trial, and if the defendant appeared, to present its defense; and - the considerations of the foreign order or the judgment do not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or have not been given in proceedings of a penal, criminal or tax nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)) or rendered subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law or jurisdiction (fraude à _la loi). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the_ monetary damages include punitive damages such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty. Punitive damages as such may be considered contrary to public order as understood under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. If an original action is brought in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made bona fide or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law as contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. In practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, even though there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review. ----- Under Luxembourg law, contractual provisions allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party in accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Luxembourg judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Luxembourg. In addition, it is questionable whether a Luxembourg court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Luxembourg instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

This summary is of a general nature only and is based on the Issuers’ understanding of UK law as applied in England and Wales and HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC) in each case as of the date of this document, both of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. This summary is intended as a general guide only and does not constitute, nor should it be construed to constitute, tax or legal advice. This summary is not exhaustive and addresses only those tax matters expressly set out below. It is limited to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and does not necessarily apply to certain classes of person (such as brokers or dealers in securities, certain professional investors or persons connected with an Issuer) or where the income from the Notes is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. References to “interest” refer to interest as that term is understood for the purposes of UK tax law. This summary assumes that there will be no substitution of any Issuer and does not address the consequences of any such substitution (notwithstanding that such substitution may be permitted by the terms of the Notes). The UK tax treatment of prospective holders depends on their individual circumstances and may therefore differ from that set out below and may be subject to change in the future.

Interest on the Notes should be payable without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The International Stock Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Notes to be traded on a recognised stock exchange outside the United Kingdom will be treated as “listed” on a recognised stock exchange if (and only if) they are admitted to trading on that exchange and they are officially listed, in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in European Economic Area states, in a country outside the United Kingdom in which there is a recognised stock exchange. If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax (e.g. if the Notes ceased to be listed on The International Stock Exchange), holders of the Notes who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty, provided any conditions for relief under such treaty and applicable domestic law are satisfied. The Notes may be issued with a premium payable on redemption (including early redemption). The payment of such a redemption premium may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may be subject to the withholding tax treatment discussed above. If payments of interest on the Notes do not have a UK source for the purposes of UK tax law, then those payments may generally be made without deduction or withholding on account of UK income tax. Interest on the Notes which constitutes UK source income for tax purposes should remain subject to UK tax by way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction. However, interest with a UK source received without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax should not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a holder of the Notes who is not resident for tax purposes in the UK (other than in the case of certain trustees) unless (i) that holder of the Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or (in the case of holders of the Notes who are companies) through a permanent establishment in the UK; and (ii) the interest is received in ----- connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment, branch or agency. The provisions of an applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant for such holders of Notes. _Guarantor payments_ The UK withholding tax treatment of payments made by a guarantor is uncertain. If a guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest or premium on the Notes, such payments may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to the availability of relief under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty. Such payments by a guarantor may not be eligible for exemptions under UK domestic law from the obligation to withhold tax. _United Kingdom paying and collecting agents: provision of information_ Persons in the UK paying interest to, or receiving interest on behalf of, another person may be required to provide certain information to HMRC regarding the identity of the payee or the person entitled to the interest. In certain circumstances, such information may be exchanged with tax authorities in other countries. _Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax_ No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on the issue or transfer of the Notes provided that the Notes do not carry and will not at any time carry (i) a right to interest the amount of which exceeds a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital or (ii) a right on repayment to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the capital and is not reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a “U.S. holder”(as defined below) (except with respect to the potential application of FATCA (as defined below) to holders that are not U.S. holders, discussed below under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws), any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or the Medicare tax on certain net investment income. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as: - financial institutions; - U.S. expatriates; - insurance companies; - dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, including those that elect to use the mark to market method of accounting for their securities; - U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies; - real estate investment trusts; - partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (including foreign branches) treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities or arrangements; ----- - persons liable for alternative minimum tax; - accrual method taxpayers who are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account in applicable financial statements (as defined in Section 451(b) of the Code); and - persons holding the notes as part of a “straddle,”“hedge,”“conversion transaction”or other integrated transaction or constructive sale. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (in this case, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to investors, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If a partnership (or other pass-through entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership (or a member in the pass-through entity or arrangement) will generally depend upon the status of the partner (or member) and the activities of the partnership (or pass-through entity or arrangement).

We do not intend to treat the possibility of the contingent payments on the Notes as subjecting the Notes to the CPDI Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not subject to the CPDI Regulations is binding on a holder, unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the matter required by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. It is possible, however, that the IRS may take a different position regarding the possibility of such contingent payments, in which case, if the position of the IRS were sustained, the timing, amount and character of income recognized with respect to a Note may be different than described herein and a U.S. holder may be required to recognize income significantly in excess of payments received and may be ----- required to treat as interest income all or a portion of any gain recognized on the disposition of a Note.

If any additional amounts are paid on the notes to “gross up” payments of interest in respect of withholding or deduction for taxes (see “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of _Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes”), such amounts will be includable in a U.S. holder’s income as ordinary_ interest income at the time such amount is received or accrued in accordance with such holder’s method of tax accounting. Interest income on the notes (including any additional amounts) will be treated as ordinary income from sources without the United States and generally will be treated as “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are complex, and U.S. regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be met for a foreign tax to be creditable, including requirements that the withholding tax constitutes a “covered withholding tax” imposed on non-residents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,” which may be unclear or difficult to determine (although a recent IRS notice provides temporary relief from certain of these requirements through 2023 if the notice is applied consistently to all foreign taxes paid during the relevant taxable year).

U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). If the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the note’s “adjusted issue price”at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,”determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the OID includible in income for each prior accrual period and decreased by payments previously made on the note other than stated interest.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuers, a Guarantor, an Initial Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that none of the Issuers of the securities, any guarantor or any of their respective affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: - We have considered the nature of the Group’s industry, its control environment and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures related to fraud and compliance with laws and regulations. - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are: ----- - Those considered to be most material to financial reporting, being UK Companies’ Act (2006), tax law and the financial reporting framework. - Our considerations of other laws and regulations that may also have a material effect on the financial statements included permissions and supervisory requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’). - We understood how Howden Group Holdings Limited is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and UK regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and Committees; and gained an understanding of the Group’s approach to governance, demonstrated by the Board’s approval of the Group’s governance framework and the Board’s review of the Group’s risk management framework and internal control processes. - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved making enquiries of those charged with governance and senior management for their awareness of any non-compliance of laws or regulations, enquiring about the policies that have been established to prevent non-compliance with laws and regulations by officers and employees, enquiring about the Group’s methods of enforcing and monitoring compliance with such policies, inspecting significant correspondence with regulators. - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group and Company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by: - Discussing among the audit engagement team and relevant specialist such as IT, valuations and tax regarding opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements. - Making enquiry of management and considering the controls that the company has established to address risks identified by the entity that seek to prevent, deter, or detect fraud. - In doing so we have determined where fraud would most likely occur in the financial statements and determined that those areas relate to revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and intangibles and accounting for new acquisitions.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortised cost are adjusted to recognise changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships. The significant accounting policies that have been applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are summarised below. The accounting policies have been applied to all the periods presented in the financial statements. On 25 January 2022 the Company acquired all of the subsidiaries and certain operations from its ultimate parent, HGH. As this is a common control transaction and out of scope of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, these consolidated accounts have been prepared on a pooling-of-interests/continuation method. As such these accounts represent the continuation of the group previously headed by HGH. These accounts are prepared as if the Group had been existence as at 1 October 2020. This means for comparatives and current year: - The share capital is set based on the Company’s on 25 January 2022 and treated as such in the comparative - The carrying value assets and liabilities transferred across are measured at the book value as at the date of transfer and not revalued to fair value - Any equity transactions entered into by the HGH itself such as share buy backs or subscription for new share capital prior to the transfer in the year and in the comparative are treated and disclosed as transactions with former equity holder within equity Any resulting differences within equity compared to the former group resulting from above items and balance sheet items not transferred across from HGH to the company are balanced with an entry into the merger reserve. Similarly on the cash flow, equity transactions entered into by the HGH company itself are presented as transactions with the former equity holder. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments and derivative financial instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.

On completing this exercise, management considered current and forecast sensitised liquidity to be adequate for the forecast period. Mitigating actions to further increase liquidity could include reduction of discretionary spend such as bonuses and travel and entertainment, increasing overseas repatriation of cash and reducing elective activity such as M&A. In this sensitised scenario, the Group continues to be forecast to be compliant with the financial covenant. Further measures include raising further cash through debt or equity. Management also identified scenarios where the Group would be forecast to breach the financial covenant or not have sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities. It was considered the likelihood of these events occurring to be low considering the various identified mitigating actions, which could be taken. Having considered these facts and circumstances, and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2024. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated statements. The Group’s main borrowings mature between 2027 to 2031. While dependent on market conditions closer to the time, the Group is confident on refinancing these borrowings in the future. acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. non-controlling interest are protective in nature or not. Where rights are assessed to be protective in nature, they do not prevent the Group controlling and consolidating the entity. profit commission or quota share treaty re-insurance, the transaction price is determined using either the expected value or most likely amount approach which is then constrained to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur based on historical patterns and current market conditions. The assumptions used in determining the transaction price in variable consideration arrangements are reviewed each reporting period. For quota share treaty reinsurance, this is based on estimated premium on inception and adjusted for past experience on the accuracy of estimated premium. For profit commission this is based on actuarial analysis for the projected ultimate loss ratio with an appropriate risk adjustment. Across the Group, there does not tend to be significant financing arrangements whereby consideration is received more than 12 months in advance of performance obligation or 12 months after the completion of the performance obligation. The exception is for DUAL claims support services and for profit commission in relation to DUAL binder years. Where material, discounting is applied to significant financing arrangements. For incremental costs to obtain a contract, the Group has adopted the practical expedient where if the amortisation profile is less than one year the expenses are expensed as incurred. For costs to fulfil a contract, costs are capitalised on the balance sheet if they meet all of the following criteria: - Relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract - Costs generate or enhance resources which will be used to satisfying the performance obligation - Costs are expected to be recoverable These will relate to placement services for a renewal of a policy or first time placement after confirmation from the end-insured that have instructed us to act on their behalf for placing a policy and primarily relate to staff costs incurred in placement of the policy. The cost of fulfilment is amortised over the revenue recognition profile, which is generally in full on policy inception, and is subject to impairment reviews. The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. As prescribed under IFRS 4 a liability adequacy test is also performed, which involves assessing whether there is any excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over and above unearned premiums at the balance sheet date. Any excess is provided for. This assessment is performed annually. Where the settlement of the insurance contract liability is expected to be in excess of 12 months, this is discounted back to present value. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management. with a corresponding charge in the Consolidated Income Statement as a substantive employment condition exists. Where conditions exist which could result in an immediate acceleration, such as death, if the Group does not have the unconditional right to defer settlement for a period of at least 12 months after balance sheet date then this amount is classified as current with the residual, if any, as non-current. Contingent consideration, put options in respect of minority interests and Group shares and derivative financial instruments are held at fair value unless hedge accounting is applied to derivative financial instruments. - In the principal market for the asset or liability; or - In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that issignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole: - Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable - Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis,the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in a hedge reserve in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss in relation to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts accumulated in the hedge reserve in equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss. The hedge reserve in equity is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. In the situation where a hedge is terminated, a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in the hedge reserve and is recognised in the same periods during which the hedged commitment or forecast transaction affects the income statement. When a hedged commitment or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement. For derivative financial instruments such as call options, only the intrinsic portion of the option is designated as a hedging instrument and hedge accounting requirements applies as described. The fair value movements relating to time value portion of the option are recorded in the cost of hedging reserve. The day one time value component is recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement over the life the hedge.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

This pattern can be straight line over the contract life or have more seasonal variability if the risk is more likely to occur during certain time periods of the year. Where premium has been received but not yet earned, this is deferred as an unearned premium liability. Where premium has been received but the cash is not freely available to use by the Group due to the terms of the insurance contract until there is sufficient greater certainty over the ultimate claims, it is treated as restricted cash. Insurance acquisition costs are the direct costs incurred to acquire the premium. Where incurred, these are accounted for as deferred insurance acquisition cost assets and expensed as insurance expenses in line with the incidence of risk pattern of the related insurance contract. An insurance contract liability is created for the best estimate of future claims payments based on claims, either made, or expected to have been incurred but not yet reported, as at the balance sheet date. A corresponding insurance expense is recognised. As prescribed under IFRS 4 a liability adequacy test is also performed, which involves assessing whether there is any excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over and above unearned premiums at the -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Expected credit loss (“ECL”) models are applied for each category of financial assets. ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL). For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.

A contract contains a lease where it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a certain period in exchange for a consideration. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised. The Group has elected to adopt practical expedients allowed in IFRS 16 in relation to low-value leases (individual assets less than £5,000) and short-term leases (lease duration less than 12 months). For these contracts, the lease payments are classified as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised on lease inception based on the discounted future lease payments. The interest rate used is the rate implicit in the lease or the entity’s incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be determined. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following components - Fixed payments over the lease term; - Future contractually agreed fixed increases or amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and - Payments related to renewals or early termination, when options to renew or terminate are reasonably certain to be exercised. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with both periods covered by an option to extend a lease if reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, and periods covered by option to terminate the lease if reasonably certain that the option to break will not be exercised. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost and on inception are measured as follows: - Initial measurement of lease liability; - Prepayments before commencement date of lease; - Initial direct costs; - Costs to restore; and - Reduced by lease incentives. Subsequently the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and subject to impairment reviews. Useful lives are based on the lease term and generally range from 2 to 15 years. The lease liability is unwound back to present value and reduced by lease payments. Where there is a change in lease payments the lease liability is remeasured using the revised lease payments discounted at the original discount rate. Where there is a change of lease term the future lease payments are discounted at a revised discount rate at the date of reassessment. In both cases there is a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset and if the right-of-use asset is reduced to below nil, the amount below nil is expensed instead. Where the Group is lessor rather than a lessee, it determines whether it is a finance lease or operating lease. If it is determined to be an operating lease, the rental income is recognised on straight-line basis over the lease term. If it is determined to be a finance lease the net investment in the lease is recognised as an asset.

Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive Income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred taxliabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable against future taxable profits. Deferred tax balances are not discounted. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised. The OECD published the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy. It is unclear if the Pillar Two model rules create additional temporary differences, whether to re-measure deferred taxes for the Pillar Two model rules and which tax rate to use to measure deferred taxes. In response to this uncertainty, IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ was amended to introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the requirements of IAS 12 under which a company does not recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two model rules.

The long-term growth rates do not exceed the long-term growth rate for the countries in which the GCGU or CGU operates in. Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual GCGU and CGU. This has been assessed using a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies and adjusted for risks specific to each GCGU and CGU: simultaneously. There were no impairments arising for other CGUs/GCGUs in the sensitised scenarios. While the sensitised scenarios indicated UK&I retail, Howden Italy, Howden Spain, Howden France and Howden ANZ could suffer an impairment, management do not consider these CGUs to be impaired based on the results of the base scenario and there are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions that will cause a material impairment.

The Group’s headquarters in One Creechurch Place comprises £59.3m (39.3%) of the total right-of-use asset and £82.6m (45.2%) of the total lease liabilities. The lease of One Creechurch Place included rent free periods until second quarter of calendar year 2021 after which quarterly payments have started and continue until it matures in December 2032. The increase during the year largely relates to the acquisitions of TigerRisk, Theoreme and Reich Groups (see note 38) which had a number of leasing arrangements. The Group also has certain leases of property with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with low value. The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases. The details of the right-of-use assets are disclosed in note 15, maturity analysis of leases in note 33 and charges recorded in operating profit in note 7 and interest expense/income in note 8. This includes charges for leases where the Group has accounted as short-term or low-value leases In addition to the disclosed maturity analysis of cash outflows, in relation to leases there are the following exposures: A number of office leases include rent reviews after a fixed period. These can be of adjustments to market rate or linked to an inflation index. On revision these would adjust both lease liability and right-of-use asset using the same discount rate that was used in the current arrangement. A number of office equipment leases include element of variable payments connected with usage such as pages printed and typically based on a consumption basis. Variable lease element within these leases is not material. There were no material extension or termination options which are probable to be exercised and are not captured in measurement of lease liabilities. There were no material residual value guarantee payments. There were no material leases not yet commenced but committed.

An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period. Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of listed peer group’s daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share. Under the terms of the scheme, early conversion may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise has not been incorporated into the calculation. Management has also assumed there will not be sale or liquidation of the Group, triggering early conversion, over the life of the scheme. “D” ordinary shares have hurdles and caps linked to the “A” ordinary shares prior to realising their potential, and these have been treated as effective exercise prices as inputs into the valuation models. “E” and “F” ordinary shares have hurdles linked to the “A” ordinary shares prior to realising their potential value and a proportion vest depending on “A”ordinary shares achieving certain hurdles. Where hurdles and caps are set in a currency other than sterling, the exchange rate on grant date is used when determining model inputs. A summary is presented below:",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The interest swaps and the intrinsic portion of the interest rate caps have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges on inception of the hedging instruments.

Amounts are recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve as and when the hedged forecast transaction occurs. Fair value movements in relation to time value of the interest rate caps are recognised in the cost of hedging reserve and amortised into the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the instrument. Historically, some interest rate hedges have been terminated as they no longer met the risk management objectives due to mismatch between variable interest rate risk and hedging instrument or an economic relationship was no longer able to be demonstrated between the hedged item and hedging instruments. On termination date, the balance in cash flow hedging reserve is recycled over the remaining life of the derivative as the underlying forecast transaction is still expected to occur and the changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Underwriting Poor claims experience could lead to larger losses than anticipated. The Group has issued reinsurance to a third party coverholder providing capacity to a retrocessional binder, with the coverholder delegating underwriting authority to a subsidiary of the Group. The retro binder covers a range of risks, where there are detailed historical records over claims albeit there is no certainty the claims pattern will repeat for the future. This detailed dataset, allied with a subsidiary of the Group having delegating underwriting authority helps ensure the quality of underwriting despite the Group not previously taking on insurance risk. As set out in note 5, the Group’s losses are limited to the collateral placed for the reinsurance contract. Scenarios were developed based on catastrophe models, which evaluate expected results over a significant timeframe and not for any one year. Based on these models, it was anticipated that there was a 2% chance of complete exhaustion of collateral when the cover was issued. Reinsurance As this is the first time the Group has taken on balance sheet risk and the low risk of complete utilisation of collateral, no reinsurance has been taken. Once there is sufficient certainty over the claims development, reinsurance may be considered to effectively lock in performance and minimise deterioration of results. Reserving Reserving risk arises where insurance liabilities are insufficient. To manage this risk, actuarial analysis is deployed to project the ultimate claims ratio as well monitoring for claims made and incurred claims but not yet reported on a regular basis. Reserving exercises include expert input from the Underwriter and independently from actuarial resources within the Group, with additional external review where appropriate. The selected reserves were within a range our outcomes considered. The upper and lower bounds or the range would have increased/decreased the claims liability by £19.0m and £11.8m respectively. For claims made, it is anticipated that the amount and timing of claims payments is typically resolved within three years.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The defined benefit schemes are valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuary’s advice. The Italian defined benefit scheme is a state operated fund and open to all eligible employees within the Assiteca Group, and official rules of the plan are described in article 2120 of the Italy civil code and the applicable national labour agreements for the establishment of the industry-wide pension funds. To note, this defined benefit scheme holds no plan assets and thus consists of defined obligations only. Within the Swiss component there are several entities who each administer a defined benefit scheme. These are open to all eligible employees. These companies provide their employees with occupational pensions against the economic consequences of old age, disability and death with various collective foundations. The insurance plans are set out in the relevant regulations, plan and affiliation agreements with the collective foundations. Bruce Stevenson Ltd sponsors a scheme which is a defined benefit pension plan and there is a separate trustee administered entity holding assets to meet long term pension liabilities. An actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2023. The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 30 September 2024. At 30 September 2023, the combined market value of the UK and Swiss plan assets was £39.7m (2022: £22.3m) and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets is sufficient to cover 60% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to £56.2m (2022: £37.1m). For the UK pension scheme, a surplus above the liabilities exist however the employer is only able to recognise a surplus when the scheme liabilities are fully settled.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables ‘S3’ All Pensioners tables published by the CMI, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes (‘SAPS’) with multipliers of 108% for males and 104% for females. In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity by using the new CMI 2021 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.25% per annum for women. Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 86.5 years and 88.1 years for men and between 89.0 years and 90.5 years for women for those reaching 65 over the next 20 years. For the Italian defined benefit scheme, the Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (TFR) is a lump sum plan and therefore post-retirement mortality assumptions are not required.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

In the fair value hierarchy, listed investments are categorised as level 1. Unlisted investments (including unlisted LDIs and synthetic equity) relate to derivatives, which are categorised as level 2, and private credit and private equity funds which are categorised as level 3. Private credit investments are valued by aggregating bid and offer quotes from brokers where this information is available. If this information is not available, investments are valued at amortised cost, with provision for impairment where appropriate. Private equity fund valuations are based on the last audited accounts of each investment plus any known movements including distributions since the last audited accounts. For the UK defined benefit scheme, the investment strategy of the schemes is determined by the independent Trustees through advice provided by an independent investment consultant. The Trustee’s objective is to achieve an above average long term return on the scheme’s assets from a mixture of capital growth and income, whilst managing investment risk and ensuring the strategy remains within the guidelines set out in the Pensions Act 1995 and 2004 and the scheme’s statement of investment principles. In setting the strategy, the nature and duration of the Scheme’s liabilities are taken into account, ensuring that an integrated approach is taken to investment risk and both short-term and long-term funding requirements. The scheme invests in a diverse range of asset classes as set out above with matching assets primarily comprising holdings in inflation linked gilts, corporate bonds and liability driven investments. To reduce volatility risk a liability driven investment (‘LDI’) strategy forms part of the Trustee’s management of the defined benefit scheme’s assets, including government bonds, corporate bonds and derivatives. Repurchase agreements are entered into with counterparties to better offset the scheme’s exposure to interest and inflation rates, whilst remaining invested in assets of a similar risk profile. Interest rate and inflation rate derivatives are also employed to complement the use of fixed and index-linked bonds in matching the profile of the scheme’s liabilities. For Switzerland, the plan assets are measured at fair value and include any employer contribution and welfare reserves. The assets of each underlying scheme are held with various collective foundations (i.e. third party pension funds) and are calculated as the sum of the retirement assets of active members adjusted for expected cash flows and a return based on interest rates. In some cases, there are weighted based on the estimated level of coverage of the pension plan.

This financial covenant is only applicable once £64.75m of the revolving credit facility (“RCF”) is drawn down and is tested on a quarterly basis requiring the Group to be below a net first lien leverage level of 6.7x. This financial covenant was not breached during the year ended 30 September 2022. There are no further financial covenants connected with the 2nd lien Term Loan. First lien leverage is defined under the Credit Agreement as first lien borrowings less unrestricted cash (including locked account and certain money market funds), divided by EBITDA as set out in the financial performance section in the strategic review. Macro economic headwinds were considered as part of the base forecast scenario to 31 December 2023, particularly on revenue, in respect of the demand for the Group’s services given the economic backdrop as well as the general state of the insurance market. The Group monitors the rolling forecast of cash flow for the period to 31 December 2023 and it is forecast to have sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities as they fall due. During this forecast period, the Group is also forecast to be compliant with the financial covenant. As part of the sensitivity analysis on forecasts, management has considered the impact on business performance, future cash flows and liquidity. This was done by stress testing the current forecast plan for a period to 31 December 2023 by modelling a decrease of up to 20% on the Group’s EBITDA with an 80% cash conversion impact. On completing this exercise, management considered current and forecast sensitised liquidity to be adequate for the forecast period. Mitigating actions to further increase liquidity could include reduction of discretionary spend such as bonuses and travel and entertainment, increasing overseas repatriation of cash and reducing elective activity such as M&A. In this sensitised scenario, the Group continues to be forecast to be compliant with the financial covenant. Further measures include raising further cash through debt or equity. Management also identified scenarios where the Group would be forecast to breach the financial covenant or not have sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities. It was considered the likelihood of these events occurring to be low considering the various identified mitigating actions, which could be taken. The Group’s main borrowings mature in 2027 and 2028, while dependant on market conditions closer to the time, the Group is confident on refinancing these borrowings in the future. Having considered these facts and circumstances, and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2023. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated statements. other comprehensive income and transferred to the translation reserve. On the sale of a subsidiary, such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. staff costs incurred in placement of the policy. The cost of fulfilment is amortised over the revenue recognition profile, which is generally in full on policy inception, and is subject to impairment reviews. For defined benefit pension schemes, the difference between the market value of the assets and the present value of the accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet. The calculation of the present value is determined using the projected unit credit method by all funds. Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions together with experience adjustments and actual return on assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expensed as they arise. Such amounts are not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent years. Defined benefit costs recognised in the income statement comprise mainly of net interest expense or income with such interest being recognised within finance costs, and service costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit obligation during the year as a result of contribution or benefit payments. Service costs consists of newly acquired entitlements during a year for active insured persons (current service cost), any expenses from newly introduced or subsequently changed plans as well as plan curtailments (past service cost), and any gains/losses from plan settlements. transactions (cash flow hedge). In addition, embedded derivatives, which are not closely related to the host contract and required under IFRS 9 are separated from the host contract and held at fair value through profit and loss. At the inception of the cash flow hedge the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the Group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions are documented. Assessments, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flows on the cash flow hedged items, are also documented. This is typically done by the matching of critical terms in both hedging instrument and hedged item including notionals, thus demonstrating an economic relationship. Ineffectiveness typically relates to credit risk in the hedging instrument and any ineffectiveness is charged through the Consolidated Income Statement. Credit risk is not expected to have a significant impact on the hedging relationship. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in a hedge reserve in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss in relation to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts accumulated in the hedge reserve in equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss. In the situation where a hedge is terminated, a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in the hedge reserve and is recognised in the same periods during which the hedged commitment or forecast transaction affects the income statement. When a hedged commitment or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement. For options, only the intrinsic portion of the option is designated as a hedging instrument and hedge accounting requirements applies as described. The fair value movements relating to time value portion of the option are recorded in the cost of hedging reserve. The day one time value component is recycled in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life the hedge. Where the Group is lessee, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised on lease inception based on the discounted future lease payments. The interest rate used is the rate implicit in the lease or the entity’s incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be determined. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following components - Fixed payments over the lease term; - Future contractually agreed fixed increases or amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and - Payments related to renewals or early termination, when options to renew or terminate are reasonably certain to be exercised. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with both periods covered by an option to extend a lease if reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, and periods covered by option to terminate the lease if reasonably certain that the option to break will not be exercised. Right of use assets are measured at cost and on inception are measured as follows: - Initial measurement of lease liability; - Prepayments before commencement date of lease; - Initial direct costs; - Costs to restore; and - Reduced by lease incentives. Subsequently the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and subject to impairment reviews. The lease liability is unwound back to present value and reduced by lease payments. Where there is a change in lease payments the lease liability is remeasured using the revised lease payments discounted at the original discount rate. Where there is a change of lease term the future lease payments are discounted at a revised discount rate at the date of reassessment. In both cases there is a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset and if the right-of-use asset is reduced to below nil, the amount below nil is expensed instead. Where the Group is lessor rather than a lessee, it determines whether it is a finance lease or operating lease. If it is determined to be an operating lease, the rental income is recognised on straight-line basis over the lease term. If it is determined to be a finance lease the net investment in the lease is recognised as an asset. This is the discounted future value of the lease receipts which is then unwound over the life of the lease, resulting in lease interest income. Where the Group is subletting office space and determines it is a finance lease, the right-ofuse asset is derecognised and the net investment asset is recognised with a gain or loss arising. Leasehold improvements — over the lease period Furniture, fixtures and fittings — three to five years Motor vehicles — three to five years The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date. The gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is recognised in the income statement. or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

CGUs, or groups of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually. Recoverable amounts for CGUs are compared against their carrying value.

A contract contains a lease of where it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a certain period in exchange for a consideration. Where the Group is lessee, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised. The Group has elected to adopt practical expedients allowed in IFRS 16 in relation to low-value leases (individual assets less than £5,000) and short-term leases (lease duration less than 12 months). For these contracts, the lease payments are classified as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Where the Group is lessee, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised on lease inception based on the discounted future lease payments. The interest rate used is the rate implicit in the lease or the entity’s incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be determined. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following components - Fixed payments over the lease term; - Future contractually agreed fixed increases or amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and - Payments related to renewals or early termination, when options to renew or terminate are reasonably certain to be exercised. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with both periods covered by an option to extend a lease if reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, and periods covered by option to terminate the lease if reasonably certain that the option to break will not be exercised. Right of use assets are measured at cost and on inception are measured as follows: - Initial measurement of lease liability; - Prepayments before commencement date of lease; - Initial direct costs; - Costs to restore; and - Reduced by lease incentives. Subsequently the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and subject to impairment reviews. The lease liability is unwound back to present value and reduced by lease payments. Where there is a change in lease payments the lease liability is remeasured using the revised lease payments discounted at the original discount rate. Where there is a change of lease term the future lease payments are discounted at a revised discount rate at the date of reassessment. In both cases there is a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset and if the right-of-use asset is reduced to below nil, the amount below nil is expensed instead. Where the Group is lessor rather than a lessee, it determines whether it is a finance lease or operating lease. If it is determined to be an operating lease, the rental income is recognised on straight-line basis over the lease term. If it is determined to be a finance lease the net investment in the lease is recognised as an asset. This is the -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on the medium-term business plan which have been approved by management covering a three-year period. These projections exclude any estimated future cash flows expected to arise from restructuring not yet committed to. Fair value less costs to sell is based on a multiple of EBITDA based on recent transactions observed in the market place. The value in use calculation is based on the following key assumptions used in the cash flow projections: - Future revenue growth based on historical experience and market intelligence - Operating margin based on historical experience and known cost optimisation initiatives Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated by using an estimated long-term growth rates stated below. The long-term growth rates do not exceed the long-term growth rate for the countries in which the GCGU or CGU operates in.

April 2022 3.79 nil 4,876,905.00 nil nil 4,876,905.00 A charge of £1.3m (2021: £nil) was recorded for the year ended 30 September 2022. In the prior year, certain subsidiaries of the A-Plan Group awarded incentive shares to employees. Due to the conversion nature of these shares into Howden Group “A” ordinary shares, these have been treated as equity settled share based payments. The Group has used a Stochastic model to calculate the fair value of one award on grant date. The fair value of an award for each scheme is dependent on the growth above specific hurdle amounts linked to the acquisition price of the A-Plan Group. Any subscription price paid is deducted from the output of the models to determine the fair value of one award on grant date. In the current year, the incentive scheme was cancelled except for KGM. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

While there is a partial natural hedge with USD and EUR denominated insurance cash and investments earning floating LIBOR or EURIBOR interest, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage the interest rate risk. It is estimated that through the combination of the natural hedge and interest rate derivatives (swaps and cap), a weighted average of 61% (2021: 36%) of the notional of the Term Loans are hedged for the period to March 2024. This further decreases to a weighted average of 41% (2021: 18%) of the notional of the Term Loans hedged for the period to March 2025 and to 8% for the remaining period to November 2027. total gain of £17.6m (2021: loss of £0.6m) was recognised in finance costs from hedge ineffectiveness arising from credit risk and changes in fair value of swaps, where the hedging relationship has been terminated.

The interest swaps and the intrinsic portion of the interest rate caps have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges on inception of the hedging instruments. The swaps and caps are recognised and measured at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with fair value movements on the swaps and intrinsic portion of the caps are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, as long as the requirements for hedge accounting are met and are effective. Amounts are recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve as and when the hedged forecast transaction occurs. Fair value movements in relation to time value of the interest rate caps are recognised in the cost of hedging reserve and amortised into the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the instrument. Historically, some interest rate hedges have been terminated as they no longer met the risk management objectives due to mismatch between variable interest rate risk and hedging instrument or an economic relationship was no longer able to be demonstrated between the hedged item and hedging instruments. On termination date, the balance in cash flow hedging reserve is recycled over the remaining life of the derivative as the underlying forecast transaction is still expected to occur and the changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. For the year ended 30 September 2022, a gain of £74.9m (2021: £2.3m) excluding tax was recognised in other comprehensive income.

The Group’s main borrowings mature in 2027 to 2031 and will be refinanced at an appropriate time in the future. To maintain leverage ratios and to remain within its risk appetite, the Group drew an additional £300m of fresh equity from its institutional investors during the year to fund M&A and expansion plans. As noted in note 1, the Group is subject to one principal financial covenant and is only applicable once a certain amount of the RCF is drawn down.

Underwriting Poor claims experience could lead to larger losses than anticipated. The Group has issued reinsurance to a third party coverholder providing capacity to a retrocessional binder, with the coverholder delegating underwriting authority to a subsidiary of the Group. The retro binder covers a range of risks, where there are detailed historical records over claims albeit there is no certainty the claims pattern will repeat for the future. This detailed dataset, allied with a subsidiary of the Group having delegating underwriting authority helps ensure the quality of underwriting despite the Group not previously taking on insurance risk. As set out in note 5, the Group’s losses are limited to the collateral placed for the reinsurance contract. Scenarios were modelling based on catastrophe models, which evaluate expected results over a significant timeframe and not for any one year. Based on these models, it is anticipated that there is a 2% chance for the complete exhaustion of collateral. Reinsurance As this is the first time the Group has taken on balance sheet risk and the low risk of complete utilisation of collateral, no reinsurance has been taken. Once there is sufficient certainty over the claims development, reinsurance may be considered to effectively lock in performance and minimise deterioration of results. Reserving Reserving risk arises where insurance liabilities are insufficient. To manage this risk, actuarial analysis is deployed to project the ultimate claims ratio as well monitoring for claims made and incurred claims but not yet reported on a regular basis. Reserving exercises include expert input from the Underwriter and independently from actuarial resources within the Group, with additional external review where appropriate. The selected reserves were within a range our outcomes considered. The upper and lower bounds or the range would have increased/decreased the claims liability by £21.5m and £17.1m respectively. For claims made, it is anticipated that the amount and timing of claims payments is typically resolved within one year. ----- The three key components of insurance risk are underwriting, reinsurance and reserving. Underwriting Poor claims experience could lead to larger losses than anticipated. The reinsurance issued to a third party coverholder providing capacity to a retrocessional binder, with the coverholder delegating underwriting authority to a subsidiary of the Group. The retro binder covers a range of risks, where there are detailed historical records over claims albeit there is no certainty the claims pattern will repeat for the future. This detailed dataset, allied with a subsidiary of the Group having delegating underwriting authority helps ensure the quality of underwriting despite the Group not previously taking on insurance risk. As set out in note 5, the Group’s losses are limited to the collateral placed for the reinsurance contract. Scenarios were modelling based on catastrophe models, which evaluate expected results over a significant timeframe and not for any one year. Based on these models, it is anticipated that there is approximately a 10% chance of utilising some of this collateral and approximately a 2% chance for the complete exhaustion of collateral. Reinsurance As this is the first time the Group has taken on balance sheet risk and the low risk of utilisation of collateral, no reinsurance has been taken.

The defined benefit schemes are valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuary’s advice. The Italian defined benefit scheme is a state operated fund and open to all eligible employees within the Assiteca Group, and official rules of the plan are described in article 2120 of the Italy Civil Code and the applicable national labour agreements for the establishment of the industry-wide pension funds. To note, this defined benefit scheme holds no plan assets and thus consists of defined obligations only. Within the Swiss component there are several entities which each administer a defined benefit scheme. These are open to all eligible employees. These companies provide their employees with occupational pensions against the economic consequences of old age, disability and death with various collective foundations. The insurance plans are set out in the relevant regulations, plan and affiliation agreements with the collective foundations. An entity, Bruce Stevenson Ltd, within the Aston Lark Group, sponsors a scheme which is a defined benefit pension plan and there is a separate trustee administered entity holding assets to meet long term pension liabilities. A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2022. The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 30 September 2023. At 30 September 2022, the combined market value of the UK and Swiss plan assets was £22.3m and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets is sufficient to cover 60% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to £37.1m. For the UK pension scheme, the employer is only able to recognise a surplus when the scheme liabilities are fully settled.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables ‘S3’ All Pensioners tables published by the CMI, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes (‘SAPS’) with multipliers of 108% for males and 104% for females. In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity by using the new CMI 2021 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.25% per annum for women. Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 86.5 years and 88.1 years for men and between 89.0 years and 90.5 years for women for those reaching 65 over the next 20 years. For the Italian defined benefit scheme, the Trattamento di Fine Rapporto (TFR) is a lump sum plan and therefore post-retirement mortality assumptions are not required.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, and identified the key laws and regulations that: - had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements including UK Companies Act (2006), tax legislation ; and - do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. This included the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). We discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists such as IT, valuations and tax regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements. As a result of performing the above, we identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas, and our specific procedures performed to address it are described below: We discussed among the audit engagement team regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements, and we have determined that significant risk exists specifically in the the transactional business of Howden M&A, and the cut-off risk of revenue recognised within Howden Insurance Brokers Limited. The Group earns fees and commissions from its insurance broking activities and there is a fraud risk that brokerage is inappropriately accelerated or deferred between accounting periods. We have assessed that there is a significant risk of material misstatement relating to revenue recognition which is pinpointed to the cut-off assertion specifically around the year end. - We have obtained an understanding of the revenue process, including procedures for determining the commission percentages in accordance with policies and binder agreements and the flow of financial information into the general ledger; - Assessed the design and implementation of controls in the revenue process specifically focusing on the controls that address revenue recognition cut-off; - Performed cut-off testing around the year-end date by selecting additional samples for revenue recognised in September 2021 and October 2021 to identify any transactions which may have been erroneously recognised as revenue in the incorrect period; and - Reviewed debits to revenue in the October listing and tested as a separate population to address the ‘fraud risk’ that transactions may be fictitiously booked in September and reversed out in October. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override. In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, we tested the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluated the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following: - reviewing financial statement disclosures by testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; ----- - enquiring of management, internal audit and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims, and instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with the Financial Conduct Authority.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

It was considered the likelihood of these events occurring to be low considering the various identified mitigating actions, which could be taken Having considered these facts and circumstances, and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated statements. cancellation. This is then released over the life of the contract on a straight line basis, or appropriate release pattern as the probability of cancellation decreases. For other variable consideration arrangements, such as profit commission, the transaction price is determined using either the expected value or most likely amount approach which is then constrained to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur based on historical patterns and current market conditions. The assumptions used in determining the transaction price in variable consideration arrangements are reviewed each reporting period. Across the Group, there does not tend to be significant financing arrangements whereby consideration is received more than 12 months in advance of performance obligation or 12 months after the completion of the performance obligation. The exception is for DUAL claims support services and for profit commission in relation to DUAL binder years. Where material, discounting is applied to significant financing arrangements. For incremental costs to obtain a contract, the Group has adopted the practical expedient where if the amortisation profile is less than one year the expenses are expensed as incurred. For costs to fulfil a contract, costs are capitalised on the balance sheet if they meet all of the following criteria: - Relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract - Costs generate or enhance resources which will be used to satisfying the performance obligation - Costs are expected to be recoverable These will relate to placement services for a renewal of a policy or first time placement after confirmation from the end-insured that have instructed us to act on their behalf for placing a policy and primarily relate to staff costs incurred in placement of the policy. The cost of fulfilment is amortised over the revenue recognition profile, which is generally in full on policy inception, and is subject to impairment reviews. balance sheet date. Any excess is provided for. This assessment is performed annually. Where the settlement of the insurance contract liability is expected to be in excess of 12 months, this is discounted back to present value. Implementation costs for cloud based software as a solution (“SaaS”) are generally expensed except where it meets the criteria to be recognised as an intangible asset in its own right. Examples of costs capitalised would relate to items such as the development of interfaces between existing software and the cloud based solution and customisation of the source code of the cloud based solution, which only the Group has access to. costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised over the remaining life of the debt instrument. If it is concluded that it is a substantial modification i.e. extinguishment of an existing debt instrument and issuance of a new debt instrument, then the new debt instrument is carried at its fair value net of any directly associated transaction costs. The difference between the carrying value of the previous debt instrument and the new debt instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement The cost of employees’ services received in exchange for the grant of rights under these schemes is measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is charged in the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period. For cash-settled schemes the fair value is re-assessed each year and any changes are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement until the liability is settled. discounted future value of the lease receipts which is then unwound over the life of the lease, resulting in lease interest income. Where the group is subletting office space and determines it is a finance lease, the right-of-use asset is derecognised and the net investment asset is recognised with a gain or loss arising. Other acquisition costs incurred which are directly attributable to obtaining finance in order to fund the acquisition are not expensed but included within the debt balance.

The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU), or group of CGUs to which it relates. CGUs, or groups of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually. Recoverable amounts for CGUs are compared against their carrying value. If the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill, the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit.

See note 24 for more details. The gain on call options in the prior year relates to the exercise of call options to acquire 51% of MIRB Holdings Limited (“Matrix”). On initial grant of the options in 2019, these were based on non-observable inputs and while the fair value of the options exceeded the transaction price for the options, this gain is required to be deferred (“day one deferred gain”). The gain can only be recognised when market participants would take into consideration changes, which would impact the value of the options. On exercising the options and paying cash consideration, the Directors are of the view the criteria for recognition of income relating to the day one deferred gain have been made. Subsequent to initial recognition of the options, the changes in fair value of the options are recognised in the income statement.

July 2021 22.7% nil% 0.3% 55 21.96 30.00 1.30 The share price on grant date was estimated by an external expert based on a blend of valuation techniques, including earnings multiple based on listed peer group and transactional precedents, value in use, and sum of the components parts of the Group. An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period. Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of listed peer group’s daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share. Under the terms of the scheme, early conversion may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise has not been incorporated into the calculation. Management have also assumed there will not be sale or liquidation of the Group, triggering early conversion, over the life of the scheme. “D” ordinary shares have hurdles and caps linked to the “A” ordinary shares prior to realising their potential, and these have been treated as effective exercise prices as inputs into the valuation models. “E” and “F” ordinary shares have hurdles linked to the “A” ordinary shares prior to realising their potential value and a proportion vest depending on “A”ordinary shares achieving certain hurdles. Where hurdles and caps are set in a currency other than sterling, the exchange rate on grant date is used when determining model inputs. A summary is presented below:",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

Due to the conversion nature of these shares into Howden Group “A” ordinary shares, these have been treated as equity settled share based payments. The Group has used a Stochastic model to calculate the fair value of one award on grant date. The fair value of an award for each scheme is dependent on the growth above specific hurdle amounts linked to the acquisition price of A-Plan Group.

It is estimated that through the combination of the natural hedge and interest rate derivatives, a weighted average of 55% (2020: 77%) of the notional of the Term Loans are hedged for Period to April 2022 and a weighted average of 36% (2020: 50%) of the notional of the Term Loans are hedged for the period to December 2024. This further decreases to a weighted average of 18% (2020: n/a) of the notional of the Term Loans hedged for the remaining period to November 2027. below the 1.0% and 0.0% floor of the debt instruments and forecast to remain below the floor rates for the duration of the swaps. Accordingly, hedges using swaps but no floors were deemed to not be able to demonstrate an economic relationship and hedge accounting has been terminated. On termination date, the balance in cash flow hedging reserve is recycled over the remaining life of the derivative as the underlying forecast transaction is still expected to occur and the changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. For the year ended 30 September 2021, a gain of £2.3m (2020: loss of £13.2m) excluding tax was recognised in other comprehensive income. A total of £11.1m loss (2020: £7.6m) was recycled from equity to profit and loss. A total loss of £0.6m (2020: loss of £0.2m) was recognised in finance costs from hedge ineffectiveness arising from credit risk and changes in fair value of swaps, where the hedging relationship has been terminated. A 50bps change in interest rates would not have a material impact for the year ended 30 September 2021 or 30 September 2020. Group Treasury overseas Howden’s IBOR transition alongside divisions who are responsible for transitioning the exposures in their own reporting structures. The transition project is ongoing and managed in phases with Group Treasury providing updates to senior management committees periodically. The first phase focuses on benchmark rates coming to an end on 31 December 2021 and Howden’s main sterling LIBOR exposure is in the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) and sterling intercompany loans. No material exposures have been identified in contracts with suppliers. Howden updated the reference rate for the sterling RCF facility when it refinanced in early October 2021. Intercompany loans are being reviewed and will be transitioned before 31 December 2021. In phase two, Treasury will focus on Howden’s main US dollar LIBOR exposure which are the US dollar LIBOR term loan debt and the derivative portfolio. For the year ended 30 September 2021, a gain of £1.5m (2020: £0.6m) was recognised in other comprehensive income. A total gain of £1.5m (2020:£0.6m) was recycled from equity to profit and loss. A total gain of £0.2m (2020: £0.1m) was recognised in operating costs for changes in fair value of swaps after the revenue had been recognised. In addition, the Group designated a €102.1m (2020: €102.1m) portion of the EUR Term Loan and a $210.1m (2020: $176.7m) portion of the USD Term loan as hedging insruments in net investment hedges of EUR and USD foreign operations. The hedging instruments were recorded in non-current borrowings. The hedged risk is the foreign exchange risk arising on the value of the Group’s net investment in assets and liabilities in USD and EUR functional currency entities. The net gain or loss under this arrangement is recognised in other comprehensive income. The fair value changes and net effect on other comprehensive income in the year ended 30 September 2021 was a gain of £9.9m (2020: £0.8m). The value of the Group’s revenue, expenses and assets/liabilities that have USD and EUR foreign currency exposure is as follows: availability of debt by maintaining a close relationship with a number of different debt providers. As at 30 September 2021 the Group has the following outstanding balances of senior secured loan: $1,790.0m (2020: $1,268.4m) and €315.0m (2020: €243.2m). The Group also drew down $56.0m of the RCF (2020: £125.0m) to aid short term working capital requiements. As noted in note 1, the Group is subject to one principal financial covenant and is only applicable once a certain amount of the RCF is drawn down. The Group monitored the rolling forecast of cash flow for the period to December 2022. Where the RCF is forecast to be utilised sufficiently to trigger covenant compliance testing, the Group is forecast to be compliant during the forecast period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,747

The interest swaps and the intrinsic portion of the interest rate caps have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges on inception of the hedging instruments. The swaps and caps are recognised and measured at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with fair value movements on the swaps and intrinsic portion of the caps are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, as long as the requirements for hedge accounting are met and are effective. Amounts are recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve as and when the hedged forecast transaction occurs. Fair value movements in relation to time value of the interest rate caps are recognised in the cost of hedging reserve and amortised into the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the instrument. In the current year the interest floor on a USD tranche of the Term Loan repricing from 1.00% to 0.75%. Interest rate swaps with an interest rate floor of 1% had been used as hedging instruments to eliminate interest rate risk. However as there is now a corridor between 0.75% to 1.0% where there is interest rate risk, management is of the view that this no longer meets the risk objective and therefore the hedge was terminated. In the prior year it was identified that due to the deterioration of LIBOR and EURIBOR rates, these were -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,747
