The notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers will have any responsibility therefor. By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite period of time. This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss in this offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such documents, our business and the terms of this offering and the notes, including the merits and risks involved. The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future. This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the notes and (2) in offshore transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only be distributed and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided by us or by the initial purchasers. The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, (1) a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”); and (2) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this offering memorandum. ii ----- By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the notes described in this offering memorandum, other than as contained in this offering memorandum. We and the initial purchasers make no representation to you that the notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider any information included in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an investment in the notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this offering memorandum implies that any information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date after the date of this offering memorandum. You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum. We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor. We are making this offering subject to the terms described in this offering memorandum and the indenture (the “Indenture”) to be entered into by the Issuer, the guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the notes sold pursuant to this offering memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which will be deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC for the accounts of its participants, including Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and registered in its name or in the name of Cede & Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global certificates). After the initial issuance of the global certificates, notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.” In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes at a higher level than the notes might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see the section “Plan of Distribution” in this offering memorandum.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,2159,THE MERGER,2159.1,,2159.1.1,,"On February 20, 2019, the shareholders of AssuredPartners, including Apax, entered into a transaction to sell a controlling interest in the Company to an investor group led by GTCR, a leading private equity firm based in Chicago. In connection with the transaction, certain parent entities of AssuredPartners, and Apax, signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Apax sold a controlling interest in Dolphin Holdco, L.P. and its subsidiaries (including the Company) to GTCR, with affiliates of Apax participating as co-investors and retaining a noncontrolling interest in the Company. Merger Sub then merged with TopCo, which resulted in TopCo surviving as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger closed on May 13, 2019. Upon consummation of the Merger, Parent revised its partnership name to AssuredPartners Group LP. Through a series of wholly-owned subsidiaries, Parent holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of equity interest of AssuredPartners. See note 2, Merger, in the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further information.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,320,BASIS OF PRESENTATION,320.1,,320.1.1,,"All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. For the purposes of the consolidated financial data included in this offering memorandum, periods prior to May 13, 2019 reflect the financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position of AssuredPartners and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Merger, referred to as the “Predecessor,” and periods beginning on or after May 13, 2019 reflect the financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position of AssuredPartners and its consolidated subsidiaries as a result of the Merger, referred to as the “Successor.” The Predecessor financial statements do not reflect the effects of the accounting for, or the financing of, the Merger. In order to facilitate a discussion of certain results of operations across periods, we have presented (i) the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 on a combined basis, which is comprised of the results for the period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019 and the period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and (ii) the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 on a combined basis, which is comprised of the results for the period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019 and the period from May 13, 2019 to September 30, 2019. vi ----- In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) (“ASC 606”). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 for nonpublic companies is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. As a result of the Merger, AssuredPartners’ date of adoption in the Successor period began on the date of the closing of the Merger, May 13, 2019, and its audited financial statements for the period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and the unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 reflected the adoption of ASC 606. However, AssuredPartners was not required to record the cumulative effect of the adjustments as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 for any interim period during the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 or for any period within the Predecessor period. In order to facilitate a discussion of certain results of operations across periods, we have presented the results for the period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019, the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 on an adjusted basis to exclude the impact from the adoption of ASC 606. In addition, we believe the presentation of our financial information excluding the impact from the adoption of ASC 606 is useful to investors as the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain, and the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, provisions that allow the Company to exclude the impact of changes in accounting principles, including ASC 606, in calculating certain financial metrics. Such presentation is also consistent with the presentation of the Company’s financial information to holders of the Existing Notes. For additional information, including a reconciliation of our “as reported” results under ASC 606 to our adjusted results, which exclude the impact of ASC 606, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them. Unless otherwise noted, the historical financial information included in this offering memorandum is derived from the consolidated financial statements of AssuredPartners.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We refer to the terms EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow in various places in this offering memorandum. These are supplemental financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry (including companies that we have acquired or have entered into binding agreements or letters of intent to acquire and for which we have included non-GAAP financial measures in this offering memorandum) and, accordingly, such measures as used in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our presentation of EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, our calculations of EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and the vii ----- related ratio data may differ from our calculations of “Consolidated EBITDA” and the related leverage ratios under the Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of “nonGAAP financial measures,” such as EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow and any ratios or margins related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure; and - the adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with the SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For example, some of the adjustments to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow as presented in this offering memorandum may not be allowed under SEC rules. In addition, we include estimates in this offering memorandum of revenue and adjusted EBITDA of various companies or businesses that we have acquired or have signed letters of intent to acquire. These estimates are based on due diligence conducted by management and reflect an estimate of the revenue or adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, that each such company or business would have contributed during the relevant period presented, assuming that such company or business had been acquired on the first day of such period. Our estimates of revenue and adjusted EBITDA do not comply with GAAP. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data” for a further discussion and quantification of non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and to investors and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In certain circumstances in this offering memorandum, we present amounts for existing indebtedness as gross amounts prior to amortization (without giving effect to any discount, fee or commission) and total net debt and secured net debt, which is total debt or secured debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. These metrics do not comply with GAAP. Throughout this offering memorandum we present certain results (i) on a “combined” basis, which combines the results of the Predecessor and Successor, (ii) on an “adjusted” basis, which includes adjustments to exclude the impact of ASC 606, and (ii) on a “combined adjusted” basis, which both combines the results of the Predecessor and Successor and includes further adjustments to exclude the impact of ASC 606. For additional information about these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to our “as reported” results prepared in accordance with GAAP see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.” Unless otherwise noted, the financial information of AssuredPartners set forth in this offering memorandum reflects the “as reported” results of AssuredPartners under ASC 606. viii -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

We believe that this, combined with increasingly complex insurance products and an expanding list of risks that require insurance, will continue to drive the growth of the insurance brokerage market. Except for a selection of large, global insurance brokerages, such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc and Willis Towers Watson, the remainder of the market is made up of mid-sized to large regional brokerages and local participants. The middle-market insurance brokerage industry in the United States is highly fragmented and local in nature. We believe that such market fragmentation provides significant room for revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions. In addition, the average age of producers has increased, providing opportunities for competing insurance brokerages to either acquire their books of businesses or form new relationships with their clients. _Property & Casualty Market. Insurance brokers principally serve businesses, public institutions and_ individual clients by placing P&C insurance coverage on their behalf with insurers and by providing risk management services. Through their knowledge of the insurance markets and strong relationships with carriers, insurance brokers assist such businesses, institutions and clients seeking insurance coverage by negotiating competitive rates and policy terms and conditions. Insurance brokers also serve as a distribution channel for insurers and often perform much of the administrative and customer service functions that insurers would have to otherwise perform were they to sell insurance coverage directly. P&C premium rates have historically been cyclical, based on the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry, economic conditions, historical and expected loss experiences and capital availability. In the absence of a catastrophic loss, there typically is increased competition and a build-up of capital, with insurers becoming less dependent on underwriting revenues, resulting in an erosion of premium rates (known in the industry as “soft” markets). A subsequent catastrophic loss then causes insurers who are less capitalized to exit the market, leading to less competitive underwriting conditions and increasing premium rates (known in the industry as “hard” markets). The robust underwriting market then attracts increased competition and results in excess capital availability and a reduction in premium rates, thereby completing the cycle. Hard and soft markets may also be affected by broad-based trends or by factors affecting individual insurance product lines or specific geographic areas. In a soft market, insurance brokerages typically receive decreased commission revenues. However, in a soft market, insurance buyers in the small- and mid-sized markets tend to reduce deductibles, increase their limits of coverage and purchase new coverage. In contrast, in a hard market, clients in the smalland mid-sized markets generally try to maintain their overall insurance cost by reducing coverage, self-insuring some risks and maintaining higher deductibles. As a result, we believe the amount of premium expended by many small- and medium-sized businesses and resulting brokerage commission revenue tends to be less volatile than premium rates. In general, and over the long term, we believe net written insurance premiums have grown consistently with underlying insured values and the overall economy. 3 ----- 4 ----- _Employee Benefits Market. EB brokers and consultants principally serve businesses and their employees by_ providing access to individual and group medical, life and disability insurance products and services. In addition to functioning as a distributor, EB brokers and consultants may also provide advice on benefit plan design. By working with brokers that offer single-source solutions for employee benefits insurance, consulting and administration needs, businesses can fully outsource their employee benefits program design, management and administration without committing the time and cost of in-house staff or investing substantial capital in in-house technology solutions. Demand for group employee benefits products and services is largely driven by employment levels, whereas employee benefits premium rates tend to increase with medical cost inflation. As businesses continue to struggle with pension deficits, healthcare costs and importantly, the changing regulatory environment, and as employee benefits become an increasingly significant expense for businesses, we believe the role of insurance brokerage firms in the employee benefits market will continue to be important.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.2,,"We are one of the largest, fastest-growing, full-service insurance brokers in the United States, offering a broad range of property and casualty (“Property & Casualty” or “P&C”) and employee benefits (“Employee Benefits” or “EB”) insurance products and services to middle-market businesses, public institutions and high-net worth individuals. We have achieved significant growth in a highly fragmented and consolidating industry through a disciplined acquisition program that targets accretive acquisitions and by focusing on generating organic growth and profit margin expansion. In the United States, we were the eleventh largest insurance broker based on brokerage revenues generated in 2019 and the sixth largest independent P&C insurance broker based on brokerage revenues generated in 2019. We have a highly diversified revenue base with high revenue and producer retention rates. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated total adjusted revenue of $1,474.9 million, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA of $481.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $512.2 million, each on an adjusted basis. For definitions of Standalone Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and related reconciliations to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and footnote (3) in “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data.” We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers with both national scale and a strong local presence within its markets. Our organizational structure is comprised of our corporate headquarters from which we manage our 11 regions. Our corporate headquarters develops our overall growth strategy and other initiatives, identifies cross-selling opportunities, coordinates knowledge-sharing across markets and performs general administrative oversight and accounting, legal and information technology functions. Each region has its own management team that assists in the implementation of our overall growth strategy, including identifying acquisition prospects and integrating smaller tuck-in acquisitions, while also managing the day-to-day operations of the offices within its region. Our structure provides us with the ability to leverage the deep local knowledge of our producers and local leaders and the flexibility to respond quickly to changes in local markets, as well as the benefits of a national brokerage network, such as economies of scale, operating efficiencies and greater influence in carrier relationships. As of September 30, 2020, we operated approximately 305 offices in 38 states across the United States and the United Kingdom with approximately 1,300 producers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,,"We believe our following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us well to profitably grow our business: _Leading Middle-Market Broker in an Attractive Industry with Strong Fundamentals. We are a leading_ insurance broker, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. The P&C insurance market, based on total net premiums written data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, has grown at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2010 to 2019, and we believe these markets will continue to enjoy stable growth. We focus in particular on the middle-market segment of the insurance brokerage industry, which is largely served by smaller regional and local firms who typically focus on relationship selling and often lack the size and scale to leverage large premium relationships with insurers. We believe our national scale and strong expertise, combined with our flexible organizational structure and strong local relationships, will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position within the U.S. middle-market segment of the insurance brokerage industry. _Highly Diversified Revenue Base. Our revenue base is highly diversified across product lines, geographies,_ clients and producers, which limits our exposure to changes in industry and sector volatility, regional market fluctuations and individual producer performance and reduces our reliance on any individual client relationship. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, our top client each accounted for less than 1% of our total revenues, and our top ten clients represented approximately 2.9% of our total revenues, each on an as adjusted basis. Through our revenue-generating relationships with more than 1,700 insurance carriers, we are able to provide our clients with an expansive portfolio of products and services at competitive prices and increase our negotiating leverage. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, no single insurance carrier represented more than 4.7% of our total revenue. _High Producer and Revenue Retention. Our average producer retention rate and revenue retention rate has_ exceeded 94% and 94%, respectively, in each of the last three years. To retain our key producers, we have developed a compensation and incentive structure, including long-term equity-based retention and incentive programs, that aligns our producers with our growth goals and invested in sales leadership recognition and training programs and initiatives to educate and motivate our producers. In addition, our producers typically sign two-year customer non-solicit and no-hire agreements, while owners of acquired businesses are required to sign non-compete agreements that run five years from the date of acquisition. We believe our low producer turnover rate, together with our strong, long-term customer relationships, provides us with increased visibility regarding future revenues. _Strong Free Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently_ delivered strong free cash flows, driven by high Standalone Adjusted EBITDA margins, low working capital and 5 ----- light capital expenditure requirements, which have averaged less than 1% of revenue over the last three years. In addition, as a result of our many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases, we also benefit from large amounts of tax-deductible amortization expense. We believe that strong free cash flow generation affords us opportunities to strategically invest in our business and to access debt capital, allowing us to fuel growth both organically and through continued strategic acquisitions. _Proven Executive Leadership Team with a Long-Term Track Record of Value Creation. Led by Jim_ Henderson, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Tom Riley, our Chief Operating Officer, President and a Director, our senior management team has considerable insurance brokerage experience, with an average of 25 years of experience in the insurance brokerage industry, and is operationally focused. Our senior management team has successfully grown our business through a series of disciplined acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. In January 2021, Mr. Henderson will assume the role of Executive Chairman while Mr. Riley will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer. We believe our management has the vision, experience and network of relationships to continue our successful growth.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Business Strategies,9.3.1,,"We intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies: _Continue to Pursue Highly Accretive Acquisitions. We plan to continue growing our business by selectively_ entering new regional markets and expanding our product and service portfolio through sustained execution of our disciplined and selective acquisition strategy. Our dedicated eighteen-person in-house M&A team is exclusively focused on leveraging our senior management’s deep industry relationships to source proprietary and highly accretive opportunities that meet our stringent criteria. This approach, combined with our brand reputation, the reputation of our senior executives and our team-oriented and entrepreneurial environment, has allowed us to attract high-quality insurance agencies to join our organization. We have a strong track record of completing acquisitions for which letters of intent have been signed, with a successful completion rate of approximately 92% based on the revenues of the companies and businesses targeted over the past three years. Since 2016 to September 30, 2020, we have successfully executed and integrated 200 acquisitions of agencies and books of businesses, with annual combined revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $913.5 million and $287.8 million, respectively, for the most recent fiscal twelve-month period prior to the date of consummation of each acquisition. The acquisitions completed from 2016 to September 30, 2020 had an attractive average upfront purchase price multiple of 9.0 times. We continue to pursue a robust acquisition pipeline, with signed letters of intent for 21 brokerage acquisition prospects as of November 23, 2020. _Sustained Focus on Organic Revenue Growth. Led by our Chief Organic Growth Officer, we continue to_ focus on organic revenue growth through producer recruitment efforts and by restructuring our compensation and performance model to optimize our existing sales force. We have initiated regional and national sales contests to incentivize selling efforts, developed clear company-wide benchmarks and expectations for our producers as part of an annual review process, and instituted company-wide enhanced onboarding and training programs designed to develop talent and promote long-term relationships with producers. In addition, we have also invested in the development of industry-specific verticals, such as senior living, transportation, aviation, construction, architect and engineering, in order to increase retention of existing business and facilitate growth of new business. _Achieve Operational Efficiencies and Margin Improvements. We strive to increase margins both through revenue_ growth initiatives (through both the growth of new business as well as improvement in revenue retention) and proactive expense management. We had approximately $1,474.9 million of total adjusted revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, which increased approximately 20.4% compared to the prior year period, and we believe that our revenue growth initiatives will allow us to continue to grow our revenues. We have sought to improve our cost structure by increasing standardization across our organization by using 6 ----- centralized information technology, accounting centers, human resources, purchasing and real estate management. To optimize our cost structure, we have established target sales levels and operating costs across our offices and product lines. We regularly review the efficiency metrics and margins across our company to identify underperforming offices, producers and product or service lines. We also have a team of highly seasoned insurance agency operators who travel throughout the regions in which we operate to assist our local and regional leaders in identifying and executing strategies to capitalize on opportunities for operational improvements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.1,Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak,"In January 2020, the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported. Since then, as the virus reached pandemic levels, there have been mandates from federal, state and local authorities requiring forced closures, quarantine and reducing large gatherings, among other restrictions. As a result of the pandemic, more than 90% of our workforce began working remotely in March 2020, and our business continuity plan and IT transition to the remote environment performed as expected. We believe our client service levels remain unchanged from pre-pandemic levels. While some employees have returned to the office in certain geographies, most employees remain working in a remote capacity, and it is our expectation that this will continue through the end of 2020 and for some period of time in 2021. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not believe our work-from-home protocol has materially impacted our internal controls, financial reporting or operations. We believe in-person meetings are an important component to our success in attracting the best insurance agencies to join our team. Due to the pandemic-related shutdown, in-person meetings with acquisition prospects substantially decreased for several months. While some meetings have resumed, and we utilized technology solutions to continue active engagement with our acquisition pipeline, it is uncertain whether the decrease in face-to-face meetings for several months will result in a temporary decrease in acquisition activity. Furthermore, some agencies that were considering selling their business have decided to delay the selling process until the pandemic has passed. Since the second quarter of 2020, we have experienced a significant decrease in travel and entertainment-related costs as a result of the shutdown and limitations on travel. Due to the general deterioration in economic conditions, we are actively making minor adjustments to portions of our workforce in targeted areas where the volume and/or nature of the work has evolved due to the remote working environment or declining activity from the pandemic. While we expect the changes to our operations from the pandemic to be temporary, the extent to which the pandemic and the related response from the authorities may impact the Company’s insurance operations, new business opportunities, acquisition pipeline and related financial results will depend on the length that and extent to which virus-related restrictions remain in place and other future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.” However, we believe that insurance coverage and employee benefits are generally a non-discretionary cost of doing business for most companies, which we believe will result in relatively stable demand for our insurance and employee benefits products and services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The summary historical consolidated financial data as of December 31, 2018 (Predecessor) and December 31, 2019 (Successor), and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (Predecessor), the period from January 1, 2019 through May 12, 2019 (Predecessor), the period from May 13, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor Adjusted) and the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 (Combined Adjusted) are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent accountants, whose reports on these financial statements are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 (Predecessor) are derived from our audited financial statements not included in this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of September 30, 2020 (Successor) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (Combined) and September 30, 2020 (Successor Adjusted) are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for such periods included in this offering memorandum. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including those of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair statement in accordance with GAAP have been included in our unaudited financial statements for the period from January 1, 2019 through May 12, 2019 (Predecessor) and the period from May 13, 2019 through September 30, 2019 (Successor) and September 30, 2020 (Successor). The historical results included below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum are not necessarily indicative of our future performance. The summary historical consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with “Selected Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The combined results of the Predecessor and the Successor for the periods from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 are not necessarily comparable to prior periods due to the change in basis of accounting from the Merger. The presentation of these combined results does not comply with GAAP. However, we believe that this combined presentation provides useful information to enhance the comparability of our results and assess the relative performance of the business in all periods presented. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 for nonpublic companies is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. As a result of the Merger, AssuredPartners’ date of adoption in the Successor period began on the date of the closing of the Merger, May 13, 2019, and its audited financial statements for the period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and the unaudited financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 reflected the adoption of ASC 606. However, AssuredPartners was not required to record the cumulative effect of the adjustments as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 for any interim period during the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 or for any period within the Predecessor period. In order to facilitate a discussion of certain results of operations across periods, we have presented the results for the period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019, the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 on an adjusted basis to exclude the impact from the adoption of ASC 606, so that all of the financial information across all periods presented in the table below reflects our results of operations in accordance with the previous revenue recognition accounting principle and does not include the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. In addition, we believe the presentation of our financial information excluding the impact from the adoption of ASC 606 is useful to investors as the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain, and the 15 ----- terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, provisions that allow the Company to exclude the impact of changes in accounting principles, including ASC 606, in calculating certain financial metrics. Such presentation is also consistent with the presentation of the Company’s financial information to holders of the Existing Notes. The captions included within our statement of operations that are materially impacted by the change in basis of accounting include revenues and compensation expense.

(9) As adjusted total cash interest expense is calculated by adjusting total cash interest expense to give effect to this offering using the interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities and the Existing Notes and giving effect to the issuance of the notes offered hereby using an assumed interest rate, as if such issuance had occurred on October 1, 2019. Actual cash interest expense will depend upon the interest rates payable on the notes. A one-eighth increase or decrease in the assumed interest rate on the notes offered hereby would increase or decrease our as adjusted total cash interest expense by $3.8 million. (10) The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions by total cash interest expense.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.1,"The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.","In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and has spread to many countries, including the United States and Canada. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Although our business so far has not been materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, recent resurgences in COVID-19 cases throughout the United States could result in new and more restrictive lockdown or shelter-in-place orders than before, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, although we were able to take advantage of certain tax advantages under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), we cannot assure you that we will be entitled to similar future federal relief, or that any such federal relief will be enacted in response to the second or following “waves” of the COVID-19 virus. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the ultimate geographic spread and severity of COVID-19; the duration of the pandemic; business closures, travel restrictions, social distancing and other actions taken to contain and treat COVID-19; the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the virus; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the extent and duration of the effect on customer demand and buying patterns; and any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity and any acquisition financing needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As the COVID-19 pandemic and any associated protective or preventative measures continue to spread in the United States, Canada and around the world, we may experience disruptions to our business. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include the following: - _Customers. Our customers could choose to limit purchases of insurance and services due to declining business conditions, cessation of their business operations on a temporary or permanent basis, and a reduction in our customers’ insurable exposure units, all of which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue. - _Organic Growth. The impact of COVID-19 may negatively impact our business and, in particular, our organic growth. We believe that in-person meetings are important to enabling us to establish new and maintain existing client relationships, as well as effectively cross-sell and further develop our existing lines of business. The degree of the impact will depend on the extent and duration of “shelter-in-place” and lockdown measures as well as any economic contraction resulting from the pandemic. 24 ----- - _Mergers and Acquisitions. A significant component of our growth strategy includes growth through acquisitions, and a key component of successfully completing acquisitions is to meet with the principals of our acquisition targets. COVID-19 has and will continue to limit our ability to hold in-person meetings, which may make acquisitions more difficult to complete. Additionally, the number of sellers willing to sell in the current environment could be lower and limit the number of acquisition opportunities. - _Administrative Expenses. Certain of our expenses, such as real estate and office leases, are not variable with revenue and will continue regardless of the level of activity or employee base. - _Timing of Receipt of Commissions and Fees. Many carriers, as well as state and provincial departments of insurance, have granted delays in making insurance premium payments. The timing of when we receive our commissions and fees could be delayed as a result. - _Adverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. For example, insurers are subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses. Currently, in some states there is proposed legislation to require insurers to cover business interruption claims. In addition, a number of states have instituted, and other states are considering instituting, changes designed to effectively expand workers’ compensation coverage by creating presumptions of compensability of claims for certain types of workers. At least one state regulator has issued an order requiring insurers to issue premium refunds, and regulators in other states could take similar actions. As a result of the various impacts on insurers, we may have lower commissions and fees, including contingent and guaranteed supplemental commissions. It is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by Federal, state and local governments in response to COVID-19 could require an increase in taxes at the Federal, state, and local levels, which would adversely impact our results of operations. - _Operational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management, top producers or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our insurers or suppliers are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, the interruption of our or their operational capabilities could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, or perform other necessary business functions. Having shifted to remote working arrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber-attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloudbased technology, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in continued macroeconomic volatility. Specifically, a decrease or halt in economic activity in large geographic areas could adversely affect the administration of our business and the marketing of our products and services within such geographic areas, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. These and other disruptions related to COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, COVID-19 may exacerbate the other risks described below.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.2,"We may experience unexpected fluctuations in our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and which historically have varied and have been difficult to predict, which may negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.","We derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance carriers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, we derived approximately 93.1% of our total revenue from 25 ----- commissions paid by insurance carriers on the sale of insurance products to our retail and wholesale clients. Such commissions paid to us are calculated based upon a percentage of premiums paid to insurance carriers by customers for insurance products that we place and therefore any decreases in premium rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the insurance market. We have no control over the premium rates on which our commissions are calculated because premium rates are determined by insurance carriers based on a number of factors, including the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry, economic conditions, prevailing legislation, historical and expected loss experiences, capital availability and the availability of alternative insurance products, such as governmental benefits and self-insurance plans, to consumers. In addition, property and casualty premium rates have historically been cyclical. The amount of commissions we earn is therefore highly dependent on factors beyond our control. Because we cannot determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. If premiums decline or commission rates are reduced, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.3,"Profit-sharing contingent commissions paid by insurance carriers are less predictable than core commissions, which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive.","We derive a portion of our revenues from profit-sharing contingent commissions paid by insurance carriers. Profit-sharing contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance carriers based upon the overall underwriting results, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such insurance carriers during the prior year. We primarily receive these commissions in the first half of each year because they are calculated and paid in the year following the year in which the premium is generated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, we derived approximately 6.9% of our total revenue from such profit-sharing contingent commissions. Due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and potential changes in underwriting criteria if insurance carriers experience high loss ratios, we cannot predict the timing and amount of these profit-sharing contingent commissions. Further, we have no control over the process by which insurance carriers estimate loss reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations. If we are unable to meet insurance carriers’ profit or volume goals, or if insurance carriers increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control, actual payments we receive may be less than anticipated. Any decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions may adversely affect the results of our operations, cash flows and our financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.4,"Our business and results of operations depend on decisions and actions by insurance carriers and trends in the general insurance industry, which are beyond our control.","Our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which, in turn, is significantly dependent on insurance carriers’ ability to procure reinsurance. We have no control over these matters. For example, there have been changes in the reinsurance market making it more difficult for insurance carriers to obtain reinsurance coverage for life insurance, resulting in changes to the design and pricing of universal life insurance policies that may reduce their attractiveness to clients. To the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available, we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain lines of coverage that we offer to our clients, we could lose clients or be unable to place insurance, and our revenues would be adversely affected. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, no single carrier accounted for more than 4.7% of our total revenue, with the top ten carriers in the aggregate representing approximately 22.7% of our 26 ----- revenues. In addition, traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers have, in the past, outsourced, and will likely continue to outsource, the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated insurance brokers or agents such as us. In order to further reduce their expenses, these insurance carriers may seek to reduce the commission rates payable to non-affiliated insurance brokers or agents. The reduction of these commission rates, in addition to general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. The general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on our revenues which is difficult to predict, and a strong economic period may not necessarily result in higher revenues. Total insurance volumes have historically been influenced by the state of the overall economy, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in U.S. trade policy or increases in tariffs that result in a trade war. The specific impact of the economy on our revenues can be difficult to predict. When our clients are adversely impacted by declining economic or business conditions, they may reduce their purchases of insurance and risk advisory services in order to reduce expenses. In addition, reductions in our clients’ headcount, payroll, properties and the market values of assets could also adversely impact our commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. Similarly, our employee benefits business may be adversely impacted as businesses downsize and reduce headcounts and payrolls and therefore reduce insurance coverage or increase their deductibles. In addition, an increase in the number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance business. Conversely, when the economy is strong, insurance coverage typically increases as payrolls, inventories and other insured risks increase, and therefore insurance commissions would also be expected to increase. However, the higher commission revenues we generally would expect to see in a strong economic period may not necessarily occur, as any increase in the volume of insurance business brought about by favorable economic conditions may be offset by premium rates that have declined in response to increased competitive and loss conditions, among other factors. Further, our business is also impacted by general trends in the insurance industry, such as the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. Corporations have demonstrated a greater willingness to “self-insure,” including the use of captive insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs, which in turn could reduce the demand for products and services we sell.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.5,"We face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business may be materially adversely affected.","We face competition in all markets in which we operate, primarily based on product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with a number of insurance brokerages who may have greater resources than we do and as a result, these competitors may be able to identify trends more quickly or withstand an economic downturn and/or declining premium rates better than we do. In addition, over the last several decades, large insurance brokerages, new private equity-backed brokerages and publicly traded companies in the financial services industry have been acquiring and consolidating small- to medium-sized independent brokerages to offer insurance products and services and to strengthen their market share. Some insurance carriers are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers on policies they sell directly. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, we will suffer a loss of market share, decreased revenue and reduced operating margins. Further, competition may reduce the fees that the Company can obtain for services provided, which would also have an adverse effect on revenue and margins. In certain markets we compete directly with locally owned insurance brokerages and privately-owned regional insurance brokerages. Because relationships between insurance brokerages and insurance carriers or customers are often local or regional in nature, we may be competitively disadvantaged in areas in which we do not have a significant local or regional presence. Furthermore, recent technological advancements have resulted in increased competition from Internet-based specialty insurance brokerages that specialize in niche insurance markets and may be able to offer better pricing 27 ----- due to their lower cost structure. There has also been an increase in alternative insurance markets, such as self insurance, captive insurance (i.e., arrangements where the policyholder owns the insurance company), rent-acaptive arrangements, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions. While we compete in these segments on a fee-for-service basis, we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.6,"If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability.","We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for understanding our clients’ needs and delivering high-quality brokering and risk management solutions tailored to satisfy those needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur costs and impair our profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships. The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our consulting business, we may be evaluated by clients based on our track record regarding judgments and advice that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. If our assumptions and estimates turn out to be inaccurate, a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our advice and we could be exposed to liability, increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, as well as negative publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.7,"We may be unsuccessful in identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition candidates or integrating acquired insurance brokerages, which could impede our growth and ability to remain competitive in our industry.","Maintaining our current pace of growth is primarily dependent on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate insurance brokerages in new and existing markets. However, we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or there may not be any prospective acquisition candidates. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete an acquisition after identifying a candidate. We sometimes compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have greater financial resources or are otherwise willing to pay more than us. We face higher risks if our acquisition strategy requires us to seek additional financing, as our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms and conditions will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after a successful acquisition of a business, we may be unable to successfully integrate such acquired business with our existing business and operations or the business may not perform in accordance with the projections that informed the purchase price for such acquisition. The integration of an acquired business involves a number of factors that may negatively affect our operations, including, but not limited to: - distraction of management or lack of leadership within the acquired business to succeed retiring leaders; - significant costs and difficulties, including implementing or remediating controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company, integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, and sales and marketing functions, transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms, as well as retention of key personnel; - tax and accounting issues, including the creation of significant future contingent liabilities relating to earn-outs for acquisitions or other financial liabilities; and - unanticipated problems or legal liabilities. 28 ----- Although we conduct due diligence with respect to the business and operations of each of the brokerages we acquire, we may not have identified all material facts concerning these brokerages. Unanticipated events or liabilities relating to these brokerages could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Furthermore, once we have integrated an acquired brokerage, it may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or productivity comparable to our existing business, or otherwise perform as expected. While we intend that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot assure you that past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. In addition, due in part to the decentralized nature of our operations, once we have acquired a business, we may not be able to effectively monitor controls, especially transaction review and monitoring activities, of such businesses. Our failure to successfully acquire and integrate businesses may cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and/ or harm our business generally, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Specifically, customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (including policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. In addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment of contingent commissions, which are processed internally by these insurance companies and may not be timely received by us in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period. Because we are unable to control the timing of the payments, we may not be able to accurately forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures. Additionally, insurance underwriters or their affiliates may under certain circumstances seek the chargeback or repayment of commissions as a result of policy lapse, surrender, cancellation, rescission, default, or upon other specified circumstances. As a result of the chargeback or repayment of commissions, the Company may incur an expense in a particular period related to revenue previously recognized in a prior period and reflected in the Company’s financial statements.

In addition, we have also implemented performance improvement initiatives across our insurance brokerage operations, with a focus on optimizing certain selling and administrative expenses, as well as IT initiatives to better track and report sales and evaluate performances across our organization.

The insurance business is primarily a state-regulated industry. While we believe the current 29 ----- regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states, because our business is concentrated in the states identified above, we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states. In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill is determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired. Under GAAP, we are required to conduct an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We conduct impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Deterioration in our operating results, including the loss of a significant client or clients, could result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would result in us having to record an impairment charge to write-down the fair value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. In addition, GAAP requires us, on an ongoing basis, to evaluate our definite-lived intangible assets for any indicators of impairment. If we were to identify an indicator of impairment we may have to record an impairment charge to write-down the fair value of the definitelived intangible asset. Further, the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporates quantitative data and qualitative criteria including new information and judgments that can dramatically change the decision about the valuation of an intangible asset in a very short period of time. The timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management’s conclusions were different.

The legislatures and insurance departments of various states have adopted various laws and regulations addressing contingent commission arrangements, and may in the future adopt new laws and regulations, including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds. In the past there have been governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices, including practices similar to ours. Further, some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products. If our clients seek alternatives to our products and services and/or determine they will no longer make payments of contingent commissions to us, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. While we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future governmental inquiries and investigations or the responses by the market and government regulators, as well as any new laws or regulations that may be enacted, any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations. Such new laws and regulations or resolution of any governmental inquiries or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business and in particular could lead to a decrease in our contingent commissions, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

During 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (together, the “2010 Health Care Reform Legislation”) were signed into law. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increased the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees. As an employee benefits broker, we provide our clients access to group health insurance products and services, as well as advice on benefit plan design for their employees; therefore, our clients are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. If, however, we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent healthcare regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services will be negatively impacted. Other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law, it could have a material effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products and services we sell and on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, the market for certain employee benefits products the Company sells currently have a favorable tax treatment, such as the deductibility of expenses related to health insurance plans or the tax-free build-up of cash values and the tax-free nature of death benefits of life insurance products. A change in the tax treatment associated with such plans or products, or adverse determinations or guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) relative to such plans or products, could affect the demand for employee benefits products and thereby adversely impact our business and results of operations. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert, errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal and defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of customers, provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that there could be an increase in the number of such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings as they relate to business interruption insurance, especially if the insurance coverage in question is found to not include business interruptions resulting or arising from a pandemic. While most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance (subject to our deductibles), our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience.

We cannot, and likely will not be able to, predict the outcome of these claims, actions and proceedings with certainty. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier, customer or employee relationships, or divert personnel and management resources. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded.

The laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing of entities to transact business, licensing of agents, admittance of assets, regulating premium rates, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms, and restricting payment of dividends. In addition, although the federal government does not directly regulate the P&C insurance 32 ----- industry, we are also subject to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including, among others, employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination that affect the insurance industry generally. Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local, foreign, state and federal laws, rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us. In addition, recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years, which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision by these authorities may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the regulation and licensing of insurance carriers, intermediaries and others making available insurance products or services; the regulation of financial solvency of insurance carriers, including by establishing reserve requirements and requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms; the regulation of unfair trade and claims practices, including the handling and permitted investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity by industry participants; and the regulation of market conduct, including compensation arrangements between intermediaries, on the one hand, and carriers and clients, on the other hand. These activities may result in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations that adversely affect our business. Our ability to conduct our business in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. More restrictive laws, rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and expensive. Further, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing anything of value to foreign officials and other officials for improper purposes. We are also subject to economic sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other applicable sanctions authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, our results of operations, and our financial condition. Failure to comply with these laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third-party partners or agents) could result in civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, significant internal investigation costs and/or reputational harm. Our clients have the right to file complaints with regulators about our services, and these regulators may investigate and require us to address such complaints. Our failure to satisfy regulators that we are in compliance with regulatory requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities can result in disciplinary action, criminal penalties, fines, damage to our reputation and financial harm. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications at various locations or information systems, which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. 33 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

In addition, operating outside the United States may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the United States. These include, among others, risk relating to: - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including the coordination of our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management; - less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment; - political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war); - adverse trade policies and adverse changes to any of the policies of the United States or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; - adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions; and - governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States.

We are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of this information. We depend on computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets to access, process and store information about our clients, some of which is private and subject to regulatory requirements. Although we have put in place certain safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, employee or contractor malfeasance, human error and similar intrusions. Additionally, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented temporary adjustment of work schedules, allowing employees to work from home and adopt remote collaboration. As a result of these measures, and as Company employees continue to work from home and access the Company’s systems remotely, the Company may be subject to heighted information security risks, including the risk of cyber attacks. Further, the Company cannot entirely eliminate the related costs associated with or incurred by the Company to mitigate the consequences from such security and privacy incidents. If the Company’s systems or facilities were infiltrated or damaged or if the Company was unable to prevent unauthorized account access and transactions, the Company’s clients could experience data loss, financial loss and significant business interruption leading to a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to remedy, modify protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications to stakeholders, regulators, media and impacted individuals. The use of electronic communications, mobile technologies and social media by employees, clients and third parties, and the speed at which information can be widely distributed, increases the risks associated with the intentional or unintentional distribution of confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information, and personal information, and the potential for unauthorized access and transactions. 34 ----- Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not discovered until they have been launched against a target. Our third-party contractors who handle information also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary and sensitive personal information. If unauthorized parties gain access to our services or our networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive third-party information. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, or be subject to regulatory actions for breaching privacy rules, which could result in litigation, civil penalties, government investigations or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. The Company is subject to laws, regulations and contractual obligations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personal information and confidential, sensitive or proprietary data. Our own actual or perceived failure, or the failure of third-party vendors with whom we do business, to comply with these obligations could harm our business. Privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Federal and state legislators are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (“NYS Cyber Regulation”) which became effective March 1, 2017. The NYS Cyber Regulation applies to those Company subsidiaries and personnel licensed as insurance agents in New York by expanding obligations and imposing specific requirements for cybersecurity efforts. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners finalized the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “NAIC Model Law”) in 2017, which is based largely on the NYS Cyber Regulation. Once adopted by the various states, the NAIC Model Law will establish significant requirements for insurance industry licensees. The California Consumer Privacy Act (”CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020, is a further example of the increasing costs of privacy compliance our business faces and the potential for increased liability in the event of noncompliance or a data breach. Under the CCPA, California residents have a number of new rights that are enforceable by the California Attorney General (for example, rights to access and deletion of personal information), as well as a private right of action in the event of a data breach. The CCPA provides an exemption for personal information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the main federal privacy law governing financial institutions. Given this exception, we are largely exempt from many of the requirements of the CCPA. However, the California Privacy Rights Act, which is intended to augment and expand the CCPA, was passed by California voters during the November 2020 election, and many other states have passed or are considering similar laws to the CCPA. Additionally, the Company’s operations in the United Kingdom are subject to compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the United Kingdom’s implementation of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation) and any changes that may be made thereto after the United Kingdom is fully withdrawn from membership in the European Union. These initiatives and changing regulations could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers, software applications and cloud storage and requires us to allocate more resources to improved cybersecurity technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation. Additionally, if we expand our international operations, the cost and complexity of compliance, and the associated risks of noncompliance, with data privacy and data security laws, regulations and contractual obligations will further increase.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

If we are unable to hire and retain key management and sales professionals, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The insurance brokerage industry continues to experience intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have occasionally lost key individuals and teams to competitors. If key sales professionals were to end their employment with us, or if we experience significant turnover among our key sales professionals, it could negatively affect the execution of our business strategy and marketing and other objectives, disrupt our client relationships, and have a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if for any reason members of our senior management do not remain with us, our operations could be adversely affected until suitable replacements with appropriate experience can be found. If we fail to recruit and retain top producers, our organic revenue growth, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. Substantially all of our managers and sales professionals are subject to employment agreements containing post-employment restrictive covenants that prohibit the solicitation or acceptance of business for a reasonable period of time following employment. In the past, some of these managers and sales professionals have challenged the enforcement of these restrictive covenants upon resignation or termination of their employment. Many state and federal court judges, particularly in California, have shown increasing reluctance to grant us equitable relief to prevent wrongful solicitation or acceptance of our business by these former producers. Additionally, some state legislatures in the states where we operate have introduced, and in some cases passed, state laws making it more difficult to enforce these restrictive covenants. These laws and the judicial interpretation of these laws are in constant flux and normally trend in a direction that makes enforcement more challenging. Conversely, we also face the risk when hiring key producers from competing agencies that they may be subject to post-employment restrictive covenants entered into with their former agencies. For example, we hired certain producers and support staff in 2016 who were formerly employed by a competing agency. The competing agency filed a lawsuit against us, claiming certain violations of post-employment restrictive covenants of those former producers. On February 28, 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement and paid $20.0 million to the competing agency to secure, among other things, the release of the post-employment restrictive covenants for such producers. 36 ----- The cost associated with this type of litigation, as well as the potential loss of business to former sales professionals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Although Meritage’s captive insurance business constitutes an immaterial part of our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we suffer significant losses under Meritage’s captive insurance business that materially exceed the reserves established for such losses. We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by Meritage. While we believe these reserves are adequate and above compliance levels required by the State of Hawaii, new information, events or circumstances, unknown at the original valuation date, may lead to Meritage’s ultimate losses being significantly greater or less than the reserves. There are many factors that could cause the amount of reserves to be insufficient to cover the related losses, including changes in claim severity, changes in the expected level of reported claims, judicial action changing the scope and/or liability of coverage, changes in the legislative, regulatory, social and economic environment and unexpected changes in loss inflation, none of which are within our control.

The effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of our secured indebtedness, or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of our company or the subsidiary guarantors, the proceeds from the sale of assets securing our secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities and that other secured debt has been paid in full.

Under these laws, if in such a case or lawsuit a court were to find that, at the time the Issuer incurred its obligations under the notes or such guarantor incurred a guarantee, the Issuer or such guarantor: - incurred obligations under the notes or the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors, - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the notes or the guarantee, - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent, - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business, or - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts and obligations beyond its ability to pay as such debts and obligations matured (as all of the foregoing terms are defined in or interpreted under the relevant fraudulent conveyance or transfer statutes), then such court could avoid the notes or the guarantee of such guarantor or subordinate the amounts owing under the notes or such guarantee to the Issuer or such guarantor’s presently existing or future debt, or take other actions detrimental to you. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its obligations under the notes or the guarantee if the Issuer or the guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. Thus, it may be asserted (and a court may consequently determine) that the guarantors incurred their guarantees for the Issuer’s benefit and did not themselves receive a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes, such that they incurred the obligations under the guarantees for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. If a court were to void a guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the guarantor. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor. 45 ----- The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied in any proceeding, such that we cannot assure you as to what standard a court would apply in determining whether the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that an issuer or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, a company would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt or issued the guarantee: - the sum of its debts (including contingent liabilities) is greater than its assets, at fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a guarantee is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from these other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any; accordingly, in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. You may also be required to return payments you have received with respect to such guarantees. Each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. This provision may not be effective (as a legal matter or otherwise) to protect the guarantees from being avoided under applicable fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws or may reduce the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. In a Florida bankruptcy court decision (which was subsequently reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on other grounds), this kind of provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees. In addition, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to such Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

See “—The notes or the guarantees may not be enforceable because of fraudulent conveyance or transfer laws and, as a result, you may be required to return payments received by you in respect of the notes or the guarantees.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees.” As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee, could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

In addition, this offering memorandum does not include historical or pro forma financial information with respect to certain businesses and companies we have acquired. Under current rules governing the inclusion of pro _forma and historical financial statements in a registration statement and prospectus for a registered offering of_ securities, a business acquired or to be acquired is considered significant if it exceeds the 20% level under at least one of three tests related to (1) the issuer’s investment in the business to be acquired as a percentage of its consolidated total assets, (2) the issuer’s proportionate share of total assets of the business to be acquired as a percentage of its consolidated total assets and (3) the consolidated equity in income from continuing operations before income taxes of the business to be acquired as a percentage of such income of the issuer. In addition, even if none of the three tests are triggered at a level above 20%, if the aggregate of insignificant acquisitions for any of the three tests exceeds 50%, such audited historical and unaudited pro forma financial statements will be required with respect to the mathematical majority of such insignificant acquisitions. In this offering 47 ----- memorandum however, we have not included any historical financial statements for any of the insignificant acquisitions constituting a mathematical majority, and no pro forma financial information giving effect to such insignificant acquisitions is available, even though such historical financial statements and pro forma financial information would be required to be presented if this offering were registered with the SEC.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,The Merger,17.2.1,,"On February 20, 2019, the shareholders of AssuredPartners, including Apax, entered into a transaction to sell a controlling interest in the Company to an investor group led by GTCR, a leading private equity firm based in Chicago. In connection with the transaction, certain parent entities of AssuredPartners, and Apax, signed the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Apax sold a controlling interest in Dolphin Holdco, L.P. and its subsidiaries (including the Company) to GTCR, with affiliates of Apax participating as co-investors and retaining a noncontrolling interest in the Company. Merger Sub then merged with TopCo, which resulted in TopCo surviving as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger closed on May 13, 2019. Upon consummation of the Merger, Parent revised its partnership name to AssuredPartners Group LP. Through a series of wholly-owned subsidiaries, Parent holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of equity interest of AssuredPartners. See note 2, Merger, in the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further information. The combined results of the Predecessor and the Successor for the periods from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 are not necessarily comparable to corresponding periods in prior years due to the change in basis of accounting from the Merger. The presentation of these combined results does not comply with GAAP. However, we believe that this combined presentation provides useful information to enhance the comparability of our results and assess the relative performance of the business in all periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.3.1,Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak,"In January 2020, the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported. Since then, as the virus reached pandemic levels, there have been mandates from federal, state and local authorities requiring forced closures, quarantine and reducing large gatherings, among other restrictions. As a result of the pandemic, more than 90% of our workforce began working remotely in March 2020, and our business continuity plan and IT transition to the remote environment performed as expected. We believe our client service levels remain unchanged from pre-pandemic levels. While some employees have returned to the office in certain geographies, most employees remain working in a remote capacity, and it is our expectation that this will continue through the end of 2020 and for some period of time in 2021. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not believe our work-from-home protocol has materially impacted our internal controls, financial reporting or operations. We believe in-person meetings are an important component to our success in attracting the best insurance agencies to join our team. Due to the pandemic-related shutdown, in-person meetings with acquisition prospects substantially decreased for several months. While some meetings have resumed, and we utilized technology 55 ----- solutions to continue active engagement with our acquisition pipeline, it is uncertain whether the decrease in face-to-face meetings for several months will result in a temporary decrease in acquisition activity. Furthermore, some agencies that were considering selling their business have decided to delay the selling process until the pandemic has passed. Since the second quarter of 2020, we have experienced a significant decrease in travel and entertainmentrelated costs as a result of the shutdown and limitations on travel. Due to the general deterioration in economic conditions, we are actively making minor adjustments to portions of our workforce in targeted areas where the volume and/or nature of the work has evolved due to the remote working environment or declining activity from the pandemic. In addition, our estimated earn-out payables have also decreased due to downward adjustments in the forecasted financial results of the underlying acquisitions as a result of the pandemic and resulting changes in market conditions. We expect travel and entertainment-related costs will increase after the pandemic ends and “shelter-in-place” and lockdown measures due to COVID are permanently lifted to be consistent with the level of such costs incurred prior to the pandemic. While we expect the changes to our operations from the pandemic to be temporary, the extent to which the pandemic and the related response from the authorities may impact the Company’s insurance operations, new business opportunities, acquisition pipeline and related financial results will depend on the length that and extent to which virus-related restrictions remain in place and other future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.” However, we believe that insurance coverage and employee benefits are generally a non-discretionary cost of doing business for most companies, which we believe will result in relatively stable demand for our insurance and employee benefits products and services. Although our business so far has not been materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, recent resurgences in COVID-19 cases throughout the United States could result in new and more restrictive lockdown or shelter-in-place orders than before, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, although we were able to take advantage of certain tax advantages under the CARES Act, we cannot assure you that we will be entitled to similar future federal relief, or that any such federal relief will be enacted in response to the second or following “waves” of the COVID-19 virus. Under the CARES Act, we have taken advantage of the deferral of employer social security payroll tax payments. In April 2020, we began deferring all employer social security payroll tax payments for the remainder of the 2020 calendar year, with 50% of the taxes deferred until December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% deferred until December 31, 2022. We have also taken advantage of the employee retention tax credit under the CARES Act, and expect to record a reduction to compensation expense as a result of such credit starting in the fourth quarter of this year.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.3.2,Industry Conditions and Premiums,"Our commissions are typically structured as a percentage of premiums paid by our clients. These premiums are a function of insurance pricing, which we refer to as “premium rates,” and the total amount of risk insured, which we refer to as “exposure.” _Property and Casualty Market. P&C premium rates have historically been cyclical, based on the relative_ underwriting capacity of the insurance industry, economic conditions, historical and expected loss experiences and capital availability. In the absence of a catastrophic loss, there typically is increased competition and a build-up of capital, with insurers becoming less dependent on underwriting revenues, resulting in an erosion of premium rates (known in the industry as “soft” markets). A subsequent catastrophic loss then causes insurers who are less capitalized to exit the market, leading to less competitive underwriting conditions and increasing premium rates (known in the industry as “hard” markets). The robust underwriting market then attracts increased competition and results in excess capital availability and a reduction in premium rates, thereby completing the 56 ----- cycle. Hard and soft markets may also be affected by broad-based trends or by factors affecting individual insurance product lines or specific geographic areas. In a soft market, insurance brokerages typically receive decreased commission revenues. However, in a soft market, insurance buyers in the small- and mid-sized markets tend to reduce deductibles, increase their limits of coverage and purchase new coverage. In contrast, in a hard market, clients generally try to maintain their overall insurance cost by reducing coverage, self-insuring some risks and maintaining higher deductibles. As a result, the amount of premium expended by many small- and medium-sized businesses and resulting brokerage commission revenue tends to be less volatile than premium rates. For the past few years, we have been in a soft market with retractions in premium rates across the carriers. Starting 2019, retail P&C rates and exposures began to show increases and the market has continued to harden in 2020. However, it is not clear whether the rate and exposure increases will continue in the foreseeable future due to uncertainty of the current economic environment. _Employee Benefits Market. Demand for group EB products and services is largely driven by employment_ levels, whereas EB premium rates tend to increase with medical cost inflation. As businesses continue to struggle with pension deficits, healthcare costs and the changing regulatory environment, and as employee benefits become an increasingly significant expense for businesses, we believe the role of insurance brokerage firms in the EB market will continue to be important. Since the Company was founded in 2011, we have operated in a market that has experienced a modest but steady increase in demand for group EB products and services due to medical cost inflation, which together with a sales initiative for ancillary EB products and services, has led to increased sales volume-based bonuses from certain carriers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, no single carrier accounted for more than 4.7% of our total revenues, with the top ten carriers in the aggregate representing approximately 22.7% of our total revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Contingent revenues are paid by insurance carriers after the contractual period and are typically based on the overall underwriting results or volume placed with such insurance carriers during such period. Contingent revenues are typically received in the year immediately following the year in which the premium is generated, which has historically resulted in higher contingent revenue in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. While our overall revenues vary from year to year in part as a function of the foregoing, our compensation expenses, selling expense, administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Components of Results of Operations,17.4.1,Revenues,"We generate revenues primarily from commissions paid by insurance carriers on the placement of property and casualty insurance and EB products. These commissions include (1) commissions and fees (also known in the industry as “core commissions” or “base commissions”) and (2) contingent revenues. _Commissions and Fees. Commissions and fees are determined as a percentage of premiums and generally_ recur annually at the same rate for as long as the insurance is in force. Occasionally, upon request by the client, we are compensated on a negotiated fee basis, which typically represents a fixed dollar amount determined on an annual basis. We also generate fee revenues from other services that we provide to our clients, such as third-party claims administration and other risk management and consulting services. 57 ----- _Contingent Revenues. Under certain circumstances, we receive supplemental revenues (also known in the_ industry as “guaranteed supplemental commissions”) and profit-sharing contingent revenues paid by insurers that are above the base commissions paid. Supplemental revenues are determined in advance of the contractual period by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and are eligible to be paid quarterly and/or annually, with such supplemental revenues accruing monthly throughout the contractual period. Profit-sharing contingent revenues are determined and paid by insurance carriers after the contractual period, based upon the overall underwriting results, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such insurance carriers during the contractual period. We primarily receive profit-sharing contingent revenue in the first half of each year because they are calculated and paid in the year immediately following the year in which the premium is generated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Our sales producers are generally paid on a standard formula based on a percentage of their retained revenues and new business revenues. The remaining compensation is semi-variable in nature and is paid to our insurance operations’ employees, such as customer service representatives and account managers, whose primary responsibility is client service. To a limited extent, we also incur sub-brokerage expense which represents commissions paid to third-party brokers in connection with co-broker sales. Our other costs of doing business include selling expenses such as travel and entertainment expenses, and administrative expenses, such as rent expenses and professional fees. Significant non-operating expenses include interest expense on our debt balances, as well as costs relating to our acquisitions, such as transaction expenses (including legal, financing, banking, accounting and valuation fees in connection with our acquisitions), amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions (including acquired customer lists and non-compete agreements) and changes in the estimated fair value of earn-out payables. We have significant tax-deductible amortization expense as a result of our many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases. As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately $2.6 billion of net tax-deductible goodwill and other intangible assets, which are generally amortized over a 15-year period. We have implemented performance improvement initiatives across our insurance brokerage operations, with a focus on optimizing certain selling and administrative expenses. Together with our organic growth initiatives, we continue to improve operating efficiencies and achieve Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The presentation of these “adjusted” results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 does not comply with GAAP or with SEC rules. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These measures may also not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences in the manner in which they are defined and calculated. However, we believe that the presentation of these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our as reported GAAP results, provides useful information to enhance the comparability of our results and assess the relative performance of the business in all periods presented. More specifically, we believe that presenting our results on a basis that excludes the impact of the change in accounting policy for revenue recognition facilitates a comparison of our results and performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 with that of the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019. In addition, we believe the presentation of our financial information excluding the 58 ----- impact from the adoption of ASC 606 is useful to investors as the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain, and the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, provisions that allow the Company to exclude the impact of changes in accounting principles, including ASC 606, in calculating certain financial metrics.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.8,Expenses,17.8.2,Expenses,"_Compensation Expense_ Compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis and compensation expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $619.5 million and $549.5 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $70.1 million, or 12.7%, which excludes $35.7 million of net decreases related to the effects from ASC 606. These increases were due to the increased headcount resulting from acquired insurance agencies, which resulted in increases in salary, commission, bonus, other benefits and payroll expenses. Our producer commission rates during those periods remained consistent over the comparable periods. _Selling Expense_ Selling expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and selling expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $13.7 million and $17.4 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $3.7 million, or 21.4%. The decreases are mainly due to reduced travel and marketing related expenses in addition to the cost-saving initiatives across our organization. _Administrative Expense_ Administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and administrative expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $172.6 million and $150.3 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $22.2 million, or 14.8%. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in our volume of business as a result of acquisitions, as well as increases in related occupancy expenses, IT related expenses including software subscription and professional IT consulting service fees. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $13.3 million of debt issuance costs with respect to the refinancing of the senior secured credit facilities that were paid to the banks and other advisors in February and March 2020. These increases were partially offset by our continued cost-saving initiatives and reduced travel, professional services including legal and other consulting and general office administrative expenses. _Transaction Expense_ Transaction expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and transaction expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $2.3 million and $31.0 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $28.7 million, or 92.4%. The decreases are primarily attributable to the fewer acquisitions occurred during the nine months ending September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019, as well as certain non-recurring transaction expenses that were incurred in connection with the Merger which closed on May 13, 2019. _Increase (Decrease) in Estimated Earn-out Payables, Net_ Increase (decrease) in estimated earn-out payables, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and increase (decrease) in estimated earn-out payables, net for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $6.4 million and $34.2 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $27.8 million, or 81.4%. These changes were due to the adjustments in the forecasted financial results of underlying acquisitions that are subject to earn-out adjustments. The adjustments in the forecasted financial results were due to the pandemic and resulting changes in market conditions. 60 ----- _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and depreciation and amortization expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $135.5 million and $96.3 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $39.2 million, or 40.7%. The increases primarily reflected amortization of additional intangible assets and, to a lesser extent, depreciation from the fixed assets, in each case, as a result of the acquisitions consummated during the period. _Interest Expense_ Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and interest expense for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $154.3 million and $129.2 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $25.1 million, or 19.4%. The increases were directly attributable to additional bank borrowings from the full draw-downs on the delayed draw term loan facility, as well as the incremental borrowings of $170.0 million, $250.0 million and $300.0 million in November 2019, February 2020 and June 2020, respectively. The applicable margin for the $300.0 million of the incremental term loans that the Company borrowed in September 2020 was priced at 4.5% subject to a 1% LIBOR floor, while all of the existing first lien term loans were priced at 3.5%. _Accretion on Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_ Accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $15.4 million and $12.1 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $3.3 million, or 26.9%. The net increase was due to the changes in growth assumptions as a result of changing market conditions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in number of earn-out arrangements outstanding compared to the corresponding combined period in 2019. _Other Income (Expense), Net_ Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and other income (expense), net for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $5.2 million and $(16.0) million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $21.3 million. The increases were primarily due to the mark-to-market changes from the de-designated hedge instruments that will expire in December 2020, as well as the legal settlements that the Company received during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These changes and gains were offset by losses from the sale of books of business during the combined nine months ended September 30, 2020. _Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes_ The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the period from May 13, 2019 through September 30, 2019 (Successor) and the period from January 1, 2019 through May 12, 2019 (Predecessor) was 7.5%, 22.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to impacts of state taxes and permanent tax differences. A valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses (NOLs) for which it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be realized. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on a regular basis based upon all available positive and negative evidence. _Net Income_ For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, we had net income of $38.2 million as compared to a net loss of $72.3 million for the combined nine months ended September 30, 2019, due to the cumulative effect of the factors discussed above. 61 ----- _Combined Adjusted Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_ The following table and discussion presents our results (i) for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019 on an “as reported” basis in compliance with GAAP, (ii) for the Successor period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019 on an “as reported” basis in compliance with GAAP and on an “as adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of our adoption of ASC 606 and (iii) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 on a “combined adjusted” basis, which combines the results of the Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019 as reported (which does not include the impact of ASC (606)) and the Successor period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019 on an adjusted basis to exclude the impact of our adoption of ASC 606. The presentation of these “adjusted” and “combined adjusted” results does not comply with GAAP or with SEC rules. These adjusted and combined adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These measures may also not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences in the manner in which they are defined and calculated. However, we believe that the presentation of these adjusted and combined adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our as reported GAAP results, provides useful information to enhance the comparability of our results and assess the relative performance of the business in all periods presented. More specifically, we believe that presenting our results for a full twelve month period and on a basis that excludes the impact of the change in accounting policy for revenue recognition facilitates a comparison of our results and performance in 2019 with that of prior years. In addition, we believe the presentation of our financial information excluding the impact from the adoption of ASC 606 is useful to investors as the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain, and the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, provisions that allow the Company to exclude the impact of changes in accounting principles, including ASC 606. Such presentation is also consistent with the presentation of the Company’s financial information to holders of the Existing Notes. 62 ----- The following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations. _Compensation Expense_ Compensation expense of $734.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 on a combined adjusted basis reflected an increase of $125.3 million, or 20.6%, from compensation expense of $609.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increased headcount resulting from 63 ----- acquired insurance agencies and the resulting increases in employee salary, commission, bonuses and related benefit and payroll tax expenses as well as approximately $27.0 million of the accelerated vesting of Predecessor equity units that were triggered by the Merger on May 13, 2019. Our producer commission rates during those periods remained unchanged over the comparable periods. _Selling Expense_ Selling expense for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.2 million, or 21.3% compared to selling expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases are mainly due to increased travel and marketing related expenses that are offset by the cost-saving initiatives across our organization. Selling expense as a percent of revenues remained flat over the comparable periods. _Administrative Expense_ Administrative expense for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $33.7 million, or 19.5%, compared to administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall increase was primarily due to the increase in our volume of business as a result of acquisitions, as well as increases in related occupancy expenses, IT software subscription and professional service fees, such as IT expenses, legal, audit and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by our cost-saving initiatives. Administrative expense as a percent of revenues increased slightly over the comparable periods due to the aforementioned expenditures as a result of increase in our volume of business across our organization. _Transaction Expense_ Transaction expense for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $29.5 million, or 1,347.1%, compared to transaction expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the expenses incurred in connection with the Merger that was closed on May 13, 2019. _Increase in Estimated Earn-out Payables, Net_ Increase in estimated earn-out payables, net for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $8.2 million, or 29.6%, compared to increase in estimated earn-out payables, net for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was mainly due to the increase in overall number of acquisitions as well as the overall favorable changes in the forecasted financial results of underlying acquisitions that are subject to earn-out measurements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $50.7 million, or 58.3%, compared to depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases primarily reflected amortization of additional intangible assets and, to a lesser extent, depreciation from the fixed assets, in each case, as a result of the acquisitions consummated during the period as well as the fair value step-up adjustments in connection with the Merger closed on May 13, 2019. _Interest Expense_ Interest expense for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $51.9 million, or 41.0%, compared to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was directly attributable to additional bank borrowings, including the $85.0 million of draw down on our delayed draw term loan facility in August 2019 and $170.0 million of incremental term loan in November 2019, as well as changes in the applicable margin under the senior secured credit facilities. We also incurred additional indebtedness in connection with the Merger on May 13, 2019, including the borrowing under the delayed draw term loan facility and the issuance of our Existing 2027 Notes. 64 ----- _Accretion on Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_ Accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $5.3 million, or 50.6%, compared to accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase was directly attributable to the increase in the number of outstanding earn-outs payable along with the increased fair values. _Other (Expense) Income_ Other (expense) income for the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $22.0 million compared to other (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the mark-to-market change from the de-designated hedge instruments during the reporting periods, as well as the write-off of unrealized holding loss from the interest swap agreement upon the Merger that the Predecessor had applied hedge accounting. _(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes_ The effective tax rate for the Successor period from May 13, 2019 to December 31, 2019, Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019 and Predecessor year ended December 31, 2018 was 21.5%, 0.6% and 47.4%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily impacted by permanent tax differences, many of which are a result of the Merger, and state income taxes. A valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses for which it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be realized. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on a regular basis based upon all available positive and negative evidence. _Net (Loss) Income_ For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 on a combined adjusted basis, we had a net loss of $91.7 million as compared to net income of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the cumulative effect of the factors discussed above. 65 ----- _Year Ended December 31, 2018 (Predecessor) Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 (Predecessor)_ The following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. _Compensation Expense_ Compensation expense increased by $74.0 million, or 13.8%, from $535.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $609.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increased headcount from the acquired insurance agencies and the resulting increases in employee salary, commission, bonuses and related benefit and payroll tax expenses. Compensation expense as a percentage of revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease is mainly due to the expiration of incentive 66 ----- compensation programs for certain acquired agencies at the end of first quarter 2018. Lastly, our producer commission rates during those periods remained unchanged over the comparable periods. _Selling Expense_ Selling expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3.5 million, or 21.4% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased advertising and marketing related costs incurred by insurance agencies, including those that focus on certain niche markets including the public entities sector in California and the P&C personal lines business in Florida. These expenses are offset by the cost-saving initiatives across our organization. Selling expense as a percent of revenues remained consistent over the comparable periods. _Administrative Expense_ Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $31.2 million, or 22.1%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in our volume of business as a result of acquisitions and increases in related professional service fees, such as IT expenses, audit and consulting fees, which were partially offset by our cost saving initiatives. Administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly over the comparable periods due to the cost-saving initiatives across our organization. _Transaction Expense_ Transaction expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $2.1 million, or 48.4%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Transaction expense in the corresponding period in 2017 included certain transaction costs related to the acquisition of Keenan on March 31, 2017. Our acquired businesses during the year ended December 31, 2018 did not include any acquisitions similar to the size of the Keenan acquisition. _Increase in Estimated Earn-out Payables, Net._ Increase in estimated earn-out payables, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $11.8 million, or 74.4%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was mainly due to the increase in the forecasted financial results of underlying acquisitions that are subject to earn-out measurements throughout 2018. _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $13.5 million, or 18.4%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increases primarily reflected amortization of additional intangible assets and, to a lesser extent, depreciation from the fixed assets, in each case, as a result of the acquisitions consummated during the period. _Interest Expense_ Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $15.2 million, or 13.6%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was directly attributable to increased bank borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities in November and April 2018, and September 2017. In addition, starting February 2018, we started to pay semi-annual coupon payments on the Existing 2025 Notes that we issued in August 2017. These increases were offset by reduction in borrowing rates through refinancing of senior secured credit facilities during the corresponding period in 2017. 67 ----- _Accretion on Fair Value of Earn-Out Payables, Net_ Accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $0.3 million, or 3.4%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The net increase was directly attributable to the increase in the number of outstanding earn-outs payable along with the increased fair values. These increases were offset by a shorter discount period which reduced the amount of accretion. _Debt Extinguishment Loss_ Debt extinguishment loss decreased by $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in debt extinguishment loss was due to the repayment of second lien term loans in August 2017 and write-off of unamortized portion of discounts and deferred debt issuance costs upon the refinancing of first lien term loans in September 2017. _Other Income_ Other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.8 million compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to gain from sales of books of businesses during 2018 as well as the mark-to-market change from the de-designated certain hedge instruments that were no longer being effective as of March 31, 2017. _(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes_ On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. tax code including, among other things, by lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, limiting the deductibility of interest expense, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized the tax effects of the Tax Act related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the 21% corporate tax rate and to the un-repatriated foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 47.4% and 55.8%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to impacts of the lower corporate income tax rate and permanent tax differences.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Historically, our capital requirements have been for debt service obligations and to fund the acquisition of brokerage operations. The insurance brokerage industry is generally not capital intensive. We believe that our projected cash flows generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are sufficient to fund our principal debt payments, our working capital needs, planned future acquisitions and capital expenditure for the next twelve months. We are, and after completion of this offering will continue to be, significantly leveraged.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 was primarily due to the expansion of business through acquisitions and increases in net income, as well as certain non-cash adjustments, including amortization and depreciation expenses, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost and deferred income taxes during the comparable period. These increases were offset by the decreases in working capital, as well as certain non-cash adjustments, including changes in estimated earn-out payables, equity-based compensation and changes in fair value of de-designated interest rate swap contracts during the comparable period. _Combined Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 and Year Ended December 31, 2018.

Decreases in cash inflows in financing activities were primarily related to the fact that the nine months ended September 30, 2019 included $2.5 billion of capital contributions from Parent and the issuance of $475.0 million of the Existing 2027 Notes. Such decrease was partially offset by a $50.0 million of capital contribution from Parent, $250.0 million and $300.0 million of incremental borrowing under our first lien senior secured credit facility in February 2020 and in June 2020, respectively, as well as a series of draws from the 70 ----- delayed draw term loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.19,Critical Accounting Policies,17.19.1,,"_Revenue from Contracts with Customers Commissions and Fees. Commission revenues are recognized on the effective date of the insurance policy,_ which is the date that the control of the insurance policy transfers to the customer upon satisfaction of the related performance obligation and the remuneration is reasonably determinable. Fee revenues, negotiated in lieu of commission, are recognized in the same manner as commission revenue. Fee revenues generated from other services, which include but not limited to third party claims administration and other risk management consulting services, are recognized throughout the contract term, as the services are rendered, and the related performance obligation gets satisfied. Fee revenues received in advance are deferred until the related performance obligation gets satisfied and the control of the insurance policy or services transfer to the customer. In certain circumstances, the Company provides more than one performance obligation to the customer that is comprised of placement of an insurance policy and other services. The Company allocates the commissions and fees revenues with respect to each performance obligation by recognizing 80% of the revenues, which relate to the placement of insurance policy, on the effective date of the respective insurance policy; and recognize the remaining 20% over the term of the insurance policy, which is generally one year or less, as the services are rendered. _Contingent Revenue. Supplemental and profit-sharing contingent commissions from insurance companies_ are recognized in the same point in time as the commission revenue. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid, is based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period. A profit-sharing contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier and is based on, among other things, the overall underwriting results and/or growth of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. These revenues are variable in nature and not determinable until all contingencies are resolved. As such, these contingent revenues are estimated and accrued on the effective date of an insurance policy, with an amount of consideration that will be received from the insurance carrier in the following year. _Costs. Costs incurred by the Company to obtain a customer contract (Costs to Obtain) are capitalized and_ amortized over 15-years on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs to fulfill a customer contract (Costs to Fulfill), are capitalized and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year. _Acquisition Accounting_ Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Intangible assets include noncompete agreements, purchased customer accounts, trade names and acquired leases. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired agency over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The principal factor that results in recognition of goodwill is a combination of the value the Company expects to receive as it provides additional markets and capabilities to the acquired companies, as well as the value we assign to the assembled workforce which may not be recognized as an intangible asset. Noncompete agreements, customer accounts, trade names and acquired leases are valued using the income approach which is predicated on developing cash flow projections. Contingent liabilities that arise from acquisitions, referred to as “earn-out payables,” are established and measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. 72 ----- The amounts recorded as earn-out payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a one- to three-year period and are recorded as part of the purchase price consideration. The fair value of the earn-out payables is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. The Company estimates future payments using the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. In determining fair value, the Company estimates the acquired entity’s future performance using financial projections developed by management and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. The Company utilizes an option-pricing approach to incorporate the risks associated with financial projections, counterparty credit risk, as well as the nature of the earn-out payout structure. Subsequent changes in these estimated earn-out payables, including the accretion of discount and changes in fair value, are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations when incurred. The Company also acquires other assets and assumes other liabilities that typically include accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Due to their short-term nature, the book values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the fair values that are recorded on the balance sheet of the acquired business. _Transaction Expenses_ In the process of acquiring companies, the Company incurs certain incremental costs associated with consummating the transactions. These costs are expensed as incurred and include, but are not limited to, legal, advisory, accounting and valuation experts. _Goodwill and Intangible Assets_ The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets is assigned to goodwill. While goodwill is not amortizable, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill & Other, the Company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances, by applying a fair value-based test. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset. The Company reviews all intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually for goodwill) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company performs such impairment reviews at the operating platform (i.e. reporting unit) level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets. In reviewing the intangible assets, if the fair value was less than the carrying amount of the respective asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and instead perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company uses a discounted cash flow valuation method (the income approach). 73 ----- The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2019. There were no events or changes since the period following the annual impairment review through December 31, 2019 that caused the Company to perform an interim period impairment assessment. Amortizable intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which range from five to twenty years. Purchased customer accounts primarily consist of records and files that contain information about insurance policies and the related insured parties that are essential to policy renewals. Purchased trade name is amortized over five years. The favorable lease assets or unfavorable lease liabilities that arise from the business combinations are amortized over the remaining term of the respective lease agreements. _New Accounting Standards Adopted_ In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02). ASU 2018-02 allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with certain discourse requirements regarding stranded tax effects. ASU 2018-02 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (Topic 815) (ASU 2017-12), which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in ASC 815. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 reduced the complexity of and simplified the application of hedge accounting by preparers and better aligned the entity’s financial reporting for hedging relationships with those risk management activities. Adoption of ASU 2017-12 for nonpublic companies is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted upon the issuance of ASU 2017-12 with the requirement that the effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal period of adoption. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-12 effective May 13, 2019, which is the date the Successor period began. Adoption of ASU 2017-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. For nonpublic companies, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASC 2016-18, Statements of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18). The amendments in ASC 2016-18 require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and the amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The ASU 2016-18 is required to adopt full retrospective approach and is effective for annual periods presented beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for nonpublic companies. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the change in restricted cash and trust cash balances were 74 ----- reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows. The net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were previously reported as $113.5 million. With the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the net cash provided by operating activities for the aforementioned period is reported as $105.8 million. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statements of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which provides additional guidance on eight specific cash flow issues and reduces diversity in practices of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows. For nonpublic companies, ASU 2016-15 is effective fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10) Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). ASU 2016-01 eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for nonpublic business entities. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company no longer discloses fair value of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model that replaces most existing US GAAP revenue recognition guidance and depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 for nonpublic companies is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. As a result of the Merger, the Company’s date of adoption in the Successor period begins on the date of the closing of the Merger, May 13, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using a modified retrospective approach which required the Company to record cumulative effect of adjustment to retained earnings on the adoption date. _New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted_ In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). These amendments require an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from most leases on the balance sheet by lessees.

947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.20,Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk,17.20.1,,"We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use various techniques to manage our risk, including, from time to time, the use of derivative instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. _Interest Rate Risk_ Our exposure to interest rate changes results from our interest-rate-sensitive liabilities such as our first lien term loans, revolving loans and delayed draw term loans under our senior secured credit facilities. Based on the 75 ----- amount of variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2020, a 10% increase in the 30-day LIBOR rate would increase our interest expense by $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis. Our Existing 2027 Notes and Existing 2025 Notes and the notes offered hereby bear interest at a fixed rate, and we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. We utilize derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to potential fluctuation in interest rates. In order to mitigate the variability of our interest payments and any future interest rate increase, we entered into two pay-fixed-receive-variable interest rate swap agreements effective January 2016 and another pay-fixed-receive-variable interest rate swap agreement effective September 2018. As of September 30, 2020, notional value of the three interest rate swap agreements was $886.2 million. The interest rate swap agreements are expected to be effective until December 31, 2020 for the first two swap agreements; and December 31, 2021 for the third swap agreement. The 30-day LIBOR rate continued to decrease during the combined twelve months ended December 31, 2019; and starting November 2019, the Company started to make payments to the derivative counterparties. It is not clear whether the anticipated decrease in the 30-day LIBOR rate will continue in the foreseeable future due to uncertainty of the current economic environment. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of hypothetical movements in interest rates on the fair value of our interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2020. The sensitivity analysis, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the 30-day LIBOR rate increased or decreased by 10%, the net asset with respect to the interest rate swaps would decrease or increase by less than $0.1 million, respectively. As a result, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a 10% increase of hypothetical movements in LIBOR would yield a decrease in interest expense to our derivative counterparties of $0.4 million. _Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk_ Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from our insurance operations mainly in the United Kingdom. Approximately 1% of revenues, which exclude impact of ASC 606, are generated from these foreign operations. The functional currency of our United Kingdom subsidiaries is the British pound sterling (GBP). The market risk related to the foreign currency exchange rates is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the GBP, based on a weighted average of the market rates in effect during the relevant period. Based on our foreign currency exposure as of September 30, 2020, a hypothetical 10% favorable or adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 76 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

We have achieved significant growth in a highly fragmented and consolidating industry through a disciplined acquisition program that targets accretive acquisitions and by focusing on generating organic growth and profit margin expansion. In the United States, we were the eleventh largest insurance broker based on brokerage revenues generated in 2019 and the sixth largest independent P&C insurance broker based on brokerage revenues generated in 2019. We have a highly diversified revenue base with high revenue and producer retention rates. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, we generated total adjusted revenue of $1,474.9 million, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA of $481.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $512.2 million, each on an adjusted basis. For definitions of Standalone Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and related reconciliations to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and footnote (3) in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data.” We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers with both national scale and a strong local presence within its markets. Our organizational structure is comprised of our corporate headquarters from which we manage our 11 regions. Our corporate headquarters develops our overall growth strategy and other initiatives, identifies cross-selling opportunities, coordinates knowledge-sharing across markets and performs general administrative oversight and accounting, legal and information technology functions. Each region has its own management team that assists in the implementation of our overall growth strategy, including identifying acquisition prospects and integrating smaller tuck-in acquisitions, while also managing the day-to-day operations of the offices within its region. Our structure provides us with the ability to leverage the deep local knowledge of our producers and local leaders and the flexibility to respond quickly to changes in local markets, as well as the benefits of a national brokerage network, such as economies of scale, operating efficiencies and greater influence in carrier relationships. As of September 30, 2020, we operated approximately 305 offices in 38 states across the United States and the United Kingdom with approximately 1,300 producers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Insurance brokers represent a strong value proposition for insurance carriers by serving as a fully outsourced sales force and after-sales customer service function, with a variable cost structure that can be managed quickly. We believe that this, combined with increasingly complex insurance products and an expanding list of risks that require insurance, will continue to drive the growth of the insurance brokerage market. Except for a selection of large, global insurance brokerages, such as Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon plc and Willis Towers Watson, the remainder of the market is made up of mid-sized to large regional brokerages and local participants. The middle-market insurance brokerage industry in the United States is highly fragmented and local in nature. We believe that such market fragmentation provides significant room for revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions. In addition, the average age of producers has increased, providing opportunities for competing insurance brokerages to either acquire their books of businesses or form new relationships with their clients. _Property & Casualty Market. Insurance brokers principally serve businesses, public institutions and_ individual clients by placing P&C insurance coverage on their behalf with insurers and by providing risk management services. Through their knowledge of the insurance markets and strong relationships with carriers, insurance brokers assist such businesses, institutions and clients seeking insurance coverage by negotiating competitive rates and policy terms and conditions. Insurance brokers also serve as a distribution channel for insurers and often perform much of the administrative and customer service functions that insurers would have to otherwise perform were they to sell insurance coverage directly. 78 ----- P&C premium rates have historically been cyclical, based on the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry, economic conditions, historical and expected loss experiences and capital availability. In the absence of a catastrophic loss, there typically is increased competition and a build-up of capital, with insurers becoming less dependent on underwriting revenues, resulting in an erosion of premium rates (known in the industry as “soft” markets). A subsequent catastrophic loss then causes insurers who are less capitalized to exit the market, leading to less competitive underwriting conditions and increasing premium rates (known in the industry as “hard” markets). The robust underwriting market then attracts increased competition and results in excess capital availability and a reduction in premium rates, thereby completing the cycle. Hard and soft markets may also be affected by broad-based trends or by factors affecting individual insurance product lines or specific geographic areas. In a soft market, insurance brokerages typically receive decreased commission revenues. However, in a soft market, insurance buyers in the small- and mid-sized markets tend to reduce deductibles, increase their limits of coverage and purchase new coverage. In contrast, in a hard market, clients in the smalland mid-sized markets generally try to maintain their overall insurance cost by reducing coverage, self-insuring some risks and maintaining higher deductibles. As a result, we believe the amount of premium expended by many small- and medium-sized businesses and resulting brokerage commission revenue tends to be less volatile than premium rates. In general, and over the long term, we believe net written insurance premiums have grown consistently with underlying insured values and the overall economy. The following chart illustrates the net premium written in the property and casualty market for the periods presented: ($ billions) 640 618 558 534 521 503 482 461 449 447 440 442 425 427 423 426 404 368 321 269 276 280 286 297 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence 79 |558 534 521 503 482 461 449 447 440 442 425 427 423 426 404 368 321 269 276 280 286 297|Col2| |---|---| ----- The following chart illustrates the growth of the property and casualty market for the periods presented:",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

EB brokers and consultants principally serve businesses and their employees by_ providing access to individual and group medical, life and disability insurance products and services. In addition to functioning as a distributor, EB brokers and consultants may also provide advice on benefit plan design. By working with brokers that offer single-source solutions for employee benefits insurance, consulting and administration needs, businesses can fully outsource their employee benefits program design, management and administration without committing the time and cost of in-house staff or investing substantial capital in in-house technology solutions. Demand for group employee benefits products and services is largely driven by employment levels, whereas employee benefits premium rates tend to increase with medical cost inflation. As businesses continue to struggle with pension deficits, healthcare costs and importantly, the changing regulatory environment, and as employee benefits become an increasingly significant expense for businesses, we believe the role of insurance brokerage firms in the employee benefits market will continue to be important.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301
947_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.25,Our Competitive Strengths,17.25.1,,"We believe our following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us well to profitably grow our business: _Leading Middle-Market Broker in an Attractive Industry with Strong Fundamentals. We are a leading_ insurance broker, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. The P&C insurance market, based on total net premiums written data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, has grown at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2010 to 2019, and we believe these markets will continue to enjoy stable growth. We focus in particular on the middle-market segment of the insurance brokerage industry, which is largely served by smaller regional and local firms who typically focus on relationship selling and often lack the size and scale to leverage large premium relationships with insurers. We believe our national scale and strong expertise, combined with our flexible 80 ----- organizational structure and strong local relationships, will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position within the U.S. middle-market segment of the insurance brokerage industry. _Highly Diversified Revenue Base. Our revenue base is highly diversified across product lines, geographies,_ clients and producers, which limits our exposure to changes in industry and sector volatility, regional market fluctuations and individual producer performance and reduces our reliance on any individual client relationship. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, our top client each accounted for less than 1% of our total revenues, and our top ten clients represented approximately 2.9% of our total revenues, each on an as adjusted basis. Through our revenue-generating relationships with more than 1,700 insurance carriers, we are able to provide our clients with an expansive portfolio of products and services at competitive prices and increase our negotiating leverage. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, no single insurance carrier represented more than 4.7% of our total revenue. _High Producer and Revenue Retention. Our average producer retention rate and revenue retention rate has_ exceeded 94% and 94%, respectively, in each of the last three years. To retain our key producers, we have developed a compensation and incentive structure, including long-term equity-based retention and incentive programs, that aligns our producers with our growth goals and invested in sales leadership recognition and training programs and initiatives to educate and motivate our producers. In addition, our producers typically sign two-year customer non-solicit and no-hire agreements, while owners of acquired businesses are required to sign non-compete agreements that run five years from the date of acquisition. We believe our low producer turnover rate, together with our strong, long-term customer relationships, provides us with increased visibility regarding future revenues. _Strong Free Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently_ delivered strong free cash flows, driven by high Standalone Adjusted EBITDA margins, low working capital and light capital expenditure requirements, which have averaged less than 1% of revenue over the last three years. In addition, as a result of our many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases, we also benefit from large amounts of tax-deductible amortization expense. We believe that strong free cash flow generation affords us opportunities to strategically invest in our business and to access debt capital, allowing us to fuel growth both organically and through continued strategic acquisitions. _Proven Executive Leadership Team with a Long-Term Track Record of Value Creation. Led by Jim_ Henderson, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Tom Riley, our Chief Operating Officer, President and a Director, our senior management team has considerable insurance brokerage experience, with an average of 25 years of experience in the insurance brokerage industry, and is operationally focused. Our senior management team has successfully grown our business through a series of disciplined acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. In January 2021, Mr. Henderson will assume the role of Executive Chairman while Mr. Riley will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer.

Our dedicated eighteen-person in-house M&A team is exclusively focused on leveraging our senior management’s deep industry relationships to source proprietary and highly accretive opportunities that meet our stringent criteria. This approach, combined with our brand reputation, the reputation of our senior executives and our team-oriented and entrepreneurial environment, has allowed us to attract high-quality insurance agencies to join our organization. We have a strong track record of completing acquisitions for which letters of intent have been signed, with a successful completion rate of approximately 92% based on the revenues of the companies and businesses targeted over the past three years. 81 ----- Since 2016 to September 30, 2020, we have successfully executed and integrated 200 acquisitions of agencies and books of businesses, with annual combined revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $913.5 million and $287.8 million, respectively, for the most recent fiscal twelve-month period prior to the date of consummation of each acquisition. The acquisitions completed from 2016 to September 30, 2020 had an attractive average upfront purchase price multiple of 9.0 times. We continue to pursue a robust acquisition pipeline, with signed letters of intent for 21 brokerage acquisition prospects as of November 23, 2020. _Sustained Focus on Organic Revenue Growth. Led by our Chief Organic Growth Officer, we continue to_ focus on organic revenue growth through producer recruitment efforts and by restructuring our compensation and performance model to optimize our existing sales force. We have initiated regional and national sales contests to incentivize selling efforts, developed clear company-wide benchmarks and expectations for our producers as part of an annual review process, and instituted company-wide enhanced onboarding and training programs designed to develop talent and promote long-term relationships with producers. In addition, we have also invested in the development of industry-specific verticals, such as senior living, transportation, aviation, construction, architect and engineering, in order to increase retention of existing business and facilitate growth of new business. _Achieve Operational Efficiencies and Margin Improvements. We strive to increase margins both through_ revenue growth initiatives (through both the growth of new business as well as improvement in revenue retention) and proactive expense management. We had approximately $1,474.9 million of total adjusted revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 on an as adjusted basis, which increased approximately 20.4% compared to the prior year period, and we believe that our revenue growth initiatives will allow us to continue to grow our revenues. We have sought to improve our cost structure by increasing standardization across our organization by using centralized information technology, accounting centers, human resources, purchasing and real estate management. To optimize our cost structure, we have established target sales levels and operating costs across our offices and product lines. We regularly review the efficiency metrics and margins across our company to identify underperforming offices, producers and product or service lines. We also have a team of highly seasoned insurance agency operators who travel throughout the regions in which we operate to assist our local and regional leaders in identifying and executing strategies to capitalize on opportunities for operational improvements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

We evaluate every acquisition candidate based on stringent criteria, including size, geographic and industry fit, operating performance and quality of the existing management team. We believe that our broad infrastructure and national network offers acquisition targets the opportunity to grow and expand their business. These factors, combined with our brand reputation, reputation of our senior executives and our team-oriented and entrepreneurial environment, provides us with a competitive advantage and has allowed us to minimize participation in competitive auction processes. We have a strong track record of completing acquisitions for which letters of intent have been signed, with a successful completion rate of approximately 92% based on the revenues of the companies and businesses targeted over the past three years. In addition, we typically structure our acquisitions to include contingent or “earn-out” consideration to align our and the target’s incentives and encourage retention of key producers acquired. We generally aim to allocate approximately 5% to 20% of the purchase price as deferred consideration payable over one to three years, contingent upon the performance of the acquired brokerage or producers, which is typically based on the achievement of specified revenue, earnings or other financial performance measures in future periods after the consummation of the acquisition.

The Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Note Guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future Secured Indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facility Obligations, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness. The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured. 102 ----- A significant portion of the operations of AssuredPartners is conducted through AssuredPartners’ respective Subsidiaries. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes, and as described under “Note Guarantees,” Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. In addition, some or all of the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required to guarantee the Notes. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor or the Issuer, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, even if such claims do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had: - $2,658.9 million of Secured Indebtedness under our term loan facility, including the Senior Credit Facility Obligations, with $414.3 million of unused revolving availability under the Senior Credit Facilities (after giving effect to $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding); and - $1,475.0 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes and the Notes). As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries had an immaterial amount of liabilities. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, as the case may be, and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness— We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.” Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which Holdings or the Issuer (or any of their Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to Holdings or the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder 107 ----- (including a Change of Control under the Existing Notes Indentures or the Indenture). If Holdings or the Issuer experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Existing Notes Indentures, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements, including the Existing Notes Indentures, or repurchase such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Such restrictions in the Indenture with respect to the Notes can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third-party approved in writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 108 ----- 60 days prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice”), given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third-party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, as applicable. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than any Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

To the extent Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” No later than 20 Business Days after the date that the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, in the case of the Notes only, equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”). 111 ----- To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) as Declined Proceeds, and use such Declined Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination; provided, that no Notes of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply any Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Sale, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant with respect to such Asset Sale. For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents: (1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities; (2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets acquired in connection with such Asset Sale; (3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and (4) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (with the fair market value of such item of 112 ----- Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (3) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $370.0 million and (y) 5.0% of Total Assets at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale. To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Senior Credit Facilities limit, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this asset sale covenant. In the event the Issuer is contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent of its lenders or holders of such Indebtedness with respect to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or limitation. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes when required by the terms and provisions of this asset sale covenant would constitute a Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The period of time between (and including) the date of the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended and/or released to the extent applicable under clause (f) of the paragraph under “—Note Guarantees—Release of Note Guarantees” during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period), (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Issue Date to the date of such designation, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” (6) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Additional Note Guarantees” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period, (7) all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period (or deemed created, incurred or assumed in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and (8) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens permitted under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated on or after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its 114 ----- Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) on or following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture with respect to the Notes (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Notes or the Indenture unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such note on or after the respective due date expressed in such Note. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such 143 ----- Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer of the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with all conditions and covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the Issuer is required, within 30 days (or 180 144 ----- days, if with respect to a Default under “—Reports and Other Information”) upon becoming aware of any Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day or 180-day time period, as applicable). The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (such other default, the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed under “—Reports and Other Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC and are subject to changes by DTC. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact DTC or its participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The ownership interests in, and the transfers of ownership interests in, each note held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through DTC participants. 197 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified 204 ----- professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide limited relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of these exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Covered Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemption should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the exemption and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemptive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code or are otherwise permissible under applicable Similar Laws or (ii) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

No purchaser or subsequent transferee will sell or otherwise transfer such notes or any interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such note or any interest therein. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. The sale of a note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan. 205 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The Merger was funded through a combination of $15.5 million cash from the Company’s balance sheet along with the proceeds from equity and debt that consist of: (i) the issuance and sale of preferred stock by TopCo of $160.0 million, (ii) new equity units of $1.8 billion through contributions made by GTCR, Apax and certain co-investors, (iii) $547.6 million of equity rollover contributions made by certain members of the Company’s management and (iv) a new senior note with $475.0 million of aggregate principal. These proceeds were also used to repay in full outstanding borrowings under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility (Note 8) and pay related fees and expenses attributable to the Merger. The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values, with any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation and the estimated useful lives of the significant intangible assets of the Merger are based on the results of management’s assessment and an independent valuation. The following is a summary of the fair values of the net assets acquired:",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The Credit Facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint-and-several basis by each of the select subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors) of the Company and is secured by substantially all the assets of the borrower and the Guarantors. First Lien Term Loans are not subject to any maintenance financial covenants. The Revolver Loans are subject to a springing leverage covenant in the event the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolver Loans and letters of credit exceed 30% of the revolving commitments at the end of each fiscal quarter. Upon becoming subject to the springing covenant, the required ratio of first lien indebtedness (first lien debt outstanding less operating cash) to EBITDA may not be greater than 7.0:1 at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017; 6.50:1 for December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2018; and 6.25:1 beginning December 31, 2018 and thereafter. In addition, the Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to make certain prepayments out of cash flow) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s equity unit holders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted). The Company is required to make amortization installment payments on the First Lien Term Loans in quarterly installments in aggregate amounts equal to 0.25% of the funded total principal amount per quarter, with the remaining outstanding amount to be payable on October 22, 2024, the maturity date for the First Lien Term Loans. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolver Loans will be due and payable in full on October 22, 2022, the maturity date for the Revolver Loans. The Company’s Credit Facility contains a permitted change of control provision (Permitted Change of Control) which allows portability, on a pro forma basis. A Permitted Change of Control can occur prior to the F-35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",2162.35,9.** **Fair Value of Measurements and Financial Instruments,2162.35.1,Interest Rate Swaps,"Interest rate swaps are valued using pricing models that are based on certain assumptions and readily observable market-based inputs, including yield curves and implied volatilities of closely related instruments, for which transparent pricing is available. The Company reflects the credit considerations inherent in the derivative contracts with both positive and negative exposures over the remaining life of the derivative. The credit spreads calculated for each party (e.g., the hedging entity and the bank counterparty) are converted into default probabilities. The default probabilities of the hedging entity are applied to the negative exposures, resulting in a positive credit adjustment (the DVA), and the default probabilities of the bank counterparty are applied to the positive exposures, resulting in a negative credit adjustment (the CVA). The bilateral credit valuation adjustment is the sum of the positive and negative adjustments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

Overview and Basis of Presentation",2162.84.1,Successor,"On February 20, 2019, the shareholders of AssuredPartners, Inc. (the Company or the Successor) entered into a transaction to sell the insurance operations of the Company to an investor group led by GTCR (GTCR), a Chicago-based private equity firm. In connection with the transaction, the parent entities of AP Inc., Dolphin Holdco, L.P. and Dolphin TopCo, Inc. (TopCo), and their equity sponsor, Apax Partners (Apax), signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with GTCR (AP) Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and GTCR (AP) Merger Sub Inc. (the Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Apax sold their equity interests in Dolphin Holdco, L.P. and its subsidiaries to GTCR for approximately $2.7 billion of negotiated equity value. The Merger Sub then merged with TopCo, which resulted in TopCo and the Company surviving indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GTCR (AP) Holdings LP (the Merger). The Merger closed on May 13, 2019. Upon consummation of the Merger, GTCR (AP) Holdings LP revised its partnership name to The AssuredPartners Group LP (the Parent or the Partnership). Through a series of wholly owned subsidiaries, the Parent holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of equity interest of the Company. Following the closing of the Merger, the Parent acts as a holding company and all of their business operations are conducted through the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States (U.S.) and provides a broad array of insurance-related products and services on a retail basis to middle-market businesses, with a particular focus on property and casualty and employee benefits insurance products and solutions. The Company serves clients through over 6,500 employees in over 280 offices in thirty-nine states across the U.S., the District of Columbia and United Kingdom (U.K.). Since its founding in 2011, the Company has built a broad platform that is concentrated in the U.S. through a strategic acquisition program coupled with a focus on driving organic growth.

The historical financial and other data prior to the closing of the Merger have been prepared using the historical results of operations and basis of the assets and liabilities of the Predecessor. In addition, the Company adopted ASU 201409, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and related interpretations (ASC 606), using a modified retrospective approach for the Successor Period ending December 31, 2019 and all subsequent interim periods. As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Successor Period ending September 30, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AssuredPartners, Inc., and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The principal estimates used include, among others, the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, the valuation of earn-out payables established as of the date of acquisitions, the adoption of and accounting under the new revenue recognition standard, equitybased compensation, reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the estimated fair value of financial instruments. Actual results may differ from those estimates. equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The ASU 2016-18 is required to be adopted using the full retrospective approach and is effective for annual periods presented beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 for nonpublic companies. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the change in restricted cash and trust cash balances were reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows. The net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were previously reported as $113.5 million. With the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the net cash provided by operating activities for the aforementioned period is reported as $105.8 million. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statements of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash _Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which provides additional guidance on eight specific cash flow_ issues and reduces diversity in practices of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows. For nonpublic companies, ASU 2016-15 is effective fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10) _Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). ASU 2016-01_ eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for nonpublic business entities. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company no longer discloses fair value of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 outline a single comprehensive model that replaces most existing US GAAP revenue recognition guidance and depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 for nonpublic companies is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. As a result of the Merger, the Company’s date of adoption in the Successor Period begins on the date of the closing of the Merger, May 13, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using a modified retrospective approach which required the Company to record cumulative effect of adjustment to retained earnings on the adoption date. See Note 3, Revenues from Contracts with Customers. circumstances, the Company provides more than one performance obligation to the customer that is comprised of placement of an insurance policy and other services. The Company allocates the commissions and fees revenues with respect to each performance obligation by recognizing 80% of the revenues, which relate to the placement of insurance policy, on the effective date of the respective insurance policy; and recognizing the remaining 20% over the term of the insurance policy, which is generally one year or less, as the services are rendered. _Contingent Revenue. Supplemental and profit-sharing contingent commissions from insurance companies_ are recognized in the same point in time as the commission revenue. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid, is based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period. A profit-sharing contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier and is based on, among other things, the overall underwriting results and/or growth of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. These revenues are variable in nature and not determinable until all contingencies are resolved. As such, these contingent revenues are estimated and accrued on the effective date of an insurance policy, with an amount of consideration that will be received from the insurance carrier in the following year. _Costs. Costs incurred by the Company to obtain a customer contract (Costs to Obtain) are capitalized and_ amortized over 15 years based on the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs to fulfill a customer contract (Costs to Fulfill), are capitalized and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year. the insurance companies remit to the Company its earned commissions. Accordingly, commissions receivables are accounts receivable from insurance companies. two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company uses a discounted cash flow valuation method (the income approach). The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment; and no impairment was recognized as of September 30, 2019. There were no events or changes since the period following the annual impairment review through December 31, 2019 that caused the Company to perform an interim period impairment assessment. Amortizable intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which range from five to twenty years. Purchased customer accounts primarily consist of records and files that contain information about insurance policies and the related insured parties that are essential to policy renewals. Purchased trade name is amortized over five years. The favorable lease assets or unfavorable lease liabilities that arise from the business combinations are amortized over the remaining term of the respective lease agreements. possible adjustments based on data such as historical and projected claim incidence patterns, claim size, expected payment patterns and period. The Company recognizes the best estimate of the ultimate liability under moderately adverse conditions. The methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings. effect on the last day of the year. Income and expense accounts were translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss within the consolidated statements of equity. The $2.3 billion of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Merger were assigned to the following: The Company previously recorded revenue at the later of the billing or the effective date of the insurance policy. Under ASC 606, revenues from commissions and fees are recorded when the control transfers to the customer upon fulfillment of the performance obligation; and the remuneration is reasonably determinable. The resulting impact is a shift in timing from revenue recognition patterns that were historically correlated to customer billings. Certain costs that were historically expensed as incurred under the previous revenue standard are capitalized or deferred under ASC 606. These costs are directly attributable to generating revenues that include costs for obtaining and fulfilling a contract. These costs are now recognized as assets that are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of the services to which the assets relate. The impact of adoption of ASC 606 on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the Successor period ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: _Services & Other: The Company offers various services which include, but are not limited to, risk_ management, consulting and third-party administration services to customers in a wide variety of industries. The following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers, disaggregated by type of revenue and by segment, for the successor period ended December 31, 2019: Total consideration transferred during the Predecessor Period and the Successor Period are as follows: Approximately $172.2 million, of $186.4 million in goodwill in the Predecessor Period, is tax deductible and is amortized over 15 years. The remaining $14.2 million relates to the acquisition earn-out payables and will not be deductible until it is earned and paid. Approximately $153.5 million, of $177.6 million in goodwill in the Successor Period, is tax deductible and is amortized over 15 years and $3.8 million is nondeductible for income tax purposes. The remaining $20.3 million relates to the acquisition earn-out payables and will not be deductible until it is earned and paid. A reconciliation of the acquisition earn-out payables is as follows: Expected maturities may differ from stated due dates because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. The carrying amount of the amortizable intangible assets, net are as follows: require interest to be paid semi-annually at an annual rate of 8.00% on May 15 and November 15, starting November 15, 2019. The 2027 Notes mature on May 15, 2027 unless redeemed earlier or repurchased. The Company incurred arrangement and professional fees of approximately $20.5 million which have been directly deducted from the carrying value. The 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint-and-several basis by the Company’s 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company, including subordinated promissory notes, such as notes payable issued in connection with acquisitions; and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including the existing Credit Facility obligations and the 2025 Notes. The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to the obligations under the existing Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the 2027 Notes. The Company may redeem the 2027 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 15, 2022, at a redemption price calculated using a formula designed to provide the bondholders with a “make-whole” premium. Before May 15, 2022, the Company may also redeem, on one or more occasions, at a price equal to 108% plus accrued interest, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings; provided that at least 50% of the 2027 Notes originally issued on May 13, 2019 remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. Beginning on May 15, 2022, the Company may redeem the 2027 Notes at redemption prices beginning at 104%, reducing to 102% on May 15, 2023 and reducing to 100% on May 15, 2024. The 2027 Notes are not subject to any maintenance or financial covenants. However, there are affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to maintain and deliver certain financial information every quarter) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s shareholders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted) with which the Company must comply. If the Company experiences a Change of Control (other than a Permitted Change of Control), the Company is required to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes at 101% of the principal amount of such 2027 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. However, the 2027 Notes also include a change of control portability feature whereby the Company does not have to make an offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes (and holders of the 2027 Notes do not have the ability to require such repurchase), so long as the change of control qualifies as a Permitted Change of Control. In order to qualify as a Permitted Change of Control, on the date of the change of control: a. The Company’s Moody’s corporate rating must be B3 (stable) or better, and the Company’s S&P corporate rating must be B (stable) or better; and b. The Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio is equal to or less than 7.00x. for the First Lien Term Loans. Effective May 13, 2019, the Company’s Credit Facility no longer includes a Permitted Change of Control provision. On May 13, 2019, the Company entered into the Seventh Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement (Amendment No. 7), which amends the Credit Facility to terminate the Revolver Loans and entered into a new revolving credit facility (New Revolver Loans). The New Revolver Loans have borrowing limits up to $267.5 million and are scheduled to mature on April 22, 2024. Borrowings under the New Revolver Loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of 3.50%. All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. All obligations under the New Revolver Loans, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured by substantially all assets of the Successor Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The First Lien Term Loans continue to be not subject to any maintenance financial covenants. However, the New Revolver Loans are subject to a springing leverage covenant in the event the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolver Loans and letters of credit exceed, were amended from 30% to 35% of the revolving commitments at the end of each fiscal quarter. Upon becoming subject to the springing covenant, the required ratio of first lien indebtedness (first lien debt outstanding less operating cash) to EBITDA was amended from not being greater than 6.25:1 beginning December 31, 2018 and thereafter to not being greater than 7.50:1 beginning June 30, 2019 and thereafter. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to make certain prepayments out of cash flow) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s equity unit holders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted) that remained the same. In addition, the Company also entered into the Eighth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement (Amendment No. 8), which amends the Credit Facility to obtain a delayed draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan) with a borrowing limit of up to $250.0 million. The Delayed Draw Term Loan constitutes a separate class from the Company’s existing term loan facility and is not fungible with the Company’s existing term loan facility. The Company intends to use proceeds from any future borrowings to fund future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The commitments of lenders to fund under the Delayed Draw Term Loan is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain leverage ratios, the accuracy of certain representations and other customary conditions. The Delayed Draw Term Loan was issued at a discount of 100 basis points, totaling $2.5 million and is scheduled to mature on October 22, 2024. Borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, Base rate or LIBOR rate available at the time of borrowing. The Delayed Draw Term Loan may be drawn up to six times at any time on or prior to the date that is two years after the closing date, May 13, 2019. Each borrowing is subject to quarterly amortization payments, whereby 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loan are repaid on the first full quarter following the date of funding. Similar to the First Lien Term Loans, the remaining aggregate principal of all Delayed Draw Term Loans will be payable in full on the maturity date. Repayments and prepayments may not be reborrowed. On August 30, 2019, the Company drew down $85.0 million from the Delayed Draw Term Loan. The first quarterly amortization payment began on December 31, 2019. For the New Revolver Loans and Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Company incurred arrangement, up-front and professional fees of approximately $7.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively. On November 25, 2019, the Company entered into the Ninth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement, which amends the Credit Facility for the First Lien Term Loans. The Company borrowed an F-34 ----- additional $170.0 million in First Lien Term Loans through a privately placed transaction. The incremental borrowings were used to repay borrowings under the New Revolver Loans and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing, which approximated $3.7 million. The incremental portion was issued at the discount of 96 basis points, which totaled $1.6 million. No other key terms were amended. Future annual principal payments due on the Company’s indebtedness are as follows: fourth anniversary of the effective date of the Third Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement, dated on September 27, 2017, if the following provisions are met: a. The issuer’s Moody’s corporate rating is B3 (stable) or better, and the Company’s S&P corporate rating is B (stable) or better; b. The Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio is equal to or less than 6.85 times; c. The issuer provides a notice of the Permitted Change of Control at least 15 business days prior and customary information no later than 3 days prior to the effectiveness of Permitted Change of Control; and d. Only one Permitted Change of Control event is allowed. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility accrue interest at rates that are variable. The Company’s borrowings under the Credit Facility were designated as LIBOR-based loans which accrue interest at an applicable margin above a certain threshold. The threshold for LIBOR-based borrowings was the 30-day market LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for the First Lien Term Loans is 3.25% and when a Permitted Change of Control occurs, the applicable margin increases to 3.50%. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the applicable margin for the First Lien Term Loans increased to 3.50%. In addition, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Revolver Loans and terminated the Revolver Loans as the Revolver Loans were not included under the Permitted Change of Control provision. Unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the Revolver Loans were written-off and recorded in the debt extinguishment loss within the Predecessor consolidated statements of operations. exceed the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings; provided that at least 50% of the 2025 Notes originally issued on August 2, 2017 remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. Beginning on August 15, 2020, the Company may redeem the 2025 Notes at redemption prices beginning at 103.50%, reducing to 101.75% on August 15, 2021 and reducing to 100.00% on August 15, 2022. The 2025 Notes are not subject to any maintenance or financial covenants. However, there are affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to maintain and deliver certain financial information every quarter) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s shareholders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted) with which the Company must comply. The 2025 Notes also include a portability feature that is similar to the provision included in the First Lien Term Loans discussed above, whereby portability is allowed if the Permitted Change of Control occurs before the maturity of the 2025 Notes. However, portability feature in the 2025 Notes are not restricted to one-time use, unlike the First Lien Term Loans. A reconciliation of Level 3 fixed maturity securities that have been measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs is as follows: Effective March 31, 2017, the Company de-designated hedge accounting treatment on two pay-fixedreceive-variable interest rate swap agreements that were effective since January 2016. The amount of gains reclassified into earnings as result of discontinuance of hedge relationship were $6.2 million (offset by the amortization of previously recorded other comprehensive loss of $1.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and were reflected in other income in the Predecessor consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate swap contracts presented in the consolidated balance sheet includes $4.2 million in accrued expenses and other, and $12.0 million in other liabilities, respectively. The claims frequency metric represents the number of unique claim events for which benefits have been approved and payments made. Claim events are identified using a unique claimant identifier and incurral date. Thus, if an individual has multiple claims for different disabling events (and therefore different incurral dates), each will be determined to be a unique claim event. Meritage enters into agreements with policy holders associated with Keenan to assume reinsurance. Currently Meritage is not ceding any reinsurance. The history of claims duration presented as average annual percentage payout of incurred claims by age as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: Plan). The Plan is intended to align the interests of the Partnership and its leadership by providing certain key employees who have a substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the Company with additional incentives by allowing such persons to participate in the equity value created. Pursuant to the Plan, and as approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Parent, the Parent grants, and/or provides an opportunity to purchase, its equity units to certain participating employees of the Company, who have substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the organization. Class B units included an accelerated vesting provision upon the change in control event. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company recorded equity-based compensation costs associated with the acceleration of vesting of Unvested Class A-2 units and Class B profits interest units which totaled $1.5 million and $25.5 million, respectively, in the Predecessor consolidated statements of operations for the period from January 1, 2019 to May 12, 2019. The fair value of each Class B Award Unit grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions: A reconciliation between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate is as follows: At December 31, 2019, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits or associated interest or penalties recorded. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a federal net operating loss carry forward of $114.2 million and $10.4 million of state NOLs of varying amounts, which will begin to expire in 2031. For the Successor period ended December 31, 2019, Predecessor period ended May 12, 2019 and Predecessor year ended 2018, the Company recorded net deferred tax assets which include a valuation allowance of $7.2 million, $7.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively, related to state NOLs. The state NOLs may be carried forward to offset future taxable income. Realization is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOLs. For the Successor period ended December 31, 2019, Predecessor period ended May 12, 2019 and Predecessor year ended 2018, the Company had income attributable to foreign subsidiaries of less than $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to utilize current NOL carryforwards to offset the GILTI taxable inclusion and therefore did not record any related income tax payable for U.S. federal tax purposes. Also, the Company should not recognize any additional U.S. tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings considered to be previously taxed earnings from the toll charge inclusion accounted for in the 2017 tax year. The Company has conducted business and files tax returns in the U.S. and U.K. The Company’s U.S. federal and various state returns are subject to examination for the years 2012 and later, due to NOLs generated in 2012. The Company’s U.K. returns for the year 2018 and later are subject to examination. and Predecessor Period ended December 31, 2018, under these leases were $4.0 million, $2.2 million and $5.9 million respectively. There are a variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company. Accruals are recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the Company’s experience in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or additional information becomes available. The Company expenses amounts for administering or litigating claims as incurred. Neither the outcomes of these matters nor their effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations can be determined at this time. all three of the draw-downs begin on June 30, 2020. The Company drew down the $250.0 million of the borrowing capacity upon the draw on March 20, 2020 and there are no more draw-downs available from the Delayed Draw Term Loan. On February 13, 2020, the Company entered into the Tenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement (the Tenth Amendment), which amends the Credit Facility for the First Lien Term Loans and the New Revolver. Through the Tenth Amendment, the Company borrowed an additional $250.0 million in the First Lien Term Loans; increased the borrowing limit on the New Revolver from $267.5 million to $414.5 million; and extended the maturity of the First Lien Term Loans by seven years and the New Revolver by five years from the effective date of the Tenth Amendment. In addition, the Company refinanced First Lien Term Loans including the incremental portion and were issued at a discount of 25 basis points, which approximated $5.3 million. The incremental borrowings were used to repay existing borrowings under the New Revolver Loans and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing through the Tenth Amendment. The First Lien Term Loans contain a six-month soft call provision which requires the Company to pay a call premium of 1% of the outstanding First Lien Term Loan balance in the event of a refinancing event. The six-month call provision was reset on February 13, 2020. On March 30, 2020, the Company entered into the Eleventh Amendment Agreement, (the Eleventh Amendment) which amends the Credit Facility with respect to the delivery of financial statements be within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year to within 120 days specifically for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the Eleventh Amendment, the Company paid approximately $3.7 million of fees and related expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The 2027 Notes were issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, or the ongoing reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1934. The 2027 Notes require interest to be paid semi-annually at an annual rate of 8.00% on May 15 and November 15, starting November 15, 2019. The 2027 Notes mature on May 15, 2027 unless redeemed earlier or repurchased. The Company incurred arrangement and professional fees of approximately $20.5 million which have been directly deducted from the carrying value. The 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint-and-several basis by the Company’s 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company, including subordinated promissory notes, such as notes payable issued in connection with acquisitions; and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including the existing Credit Facility obligations and the 2025 Notes. The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to the obligations under the existing Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the 2027 Notes. The Company may redeem the 2027 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 15, 2022, at a redemption price calculated using a formula designed to provide the bondholders with a “make-whole” premium. Before May 15, 2022, the Company may also redeem, on one or more occasions, at a price equal to 108% plus accrued interest, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings; provided that at least 50% of the 2027 Notes originally issued on May 13, 2019 remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. Beginning on May 15, 2022, the Company may redeem the 2027 Notes at redemption prices beginning at 104%, reducing to 102% on May 15, 2023 and reducing to 100% on May 15, 2024.

The Company reflects the credit considerations inherent in the derivative contracts with both positive and negative exposures over the remaining life of the derivative. The credit spreads calculated for each party (e.g., the hedging entity and the bank counterparty) are converted into default probabilities. The default probabilities of the hedging entity are applied to the negative exposures, resulting in a positive credit adjustment (the DVA), and the default probabilities of the bank counterparty are applied to the positive exposures, resulting in a negative credit adjustment (the CVA). The bilateral credit valuation adjustment is the sum of the positive and negative adjustments. F-70 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,301

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Total consideration transferred during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 are as follows: A reconciliation of the acquisition earn-out payables is as follows: The number, fair values, and duration of investments in a continuous loss position are as follows: Expected maturities may differ from stated due dates because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. The 2027 Notes are not subject to any maintenance or financial covenants. However, there are affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to maintain and deliver certain financial information every quarter) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s shareholders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted) with which the Company must comply. If the Company experiences a Change of Control (other than a Permitted Change of Control), the Company is required to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes at 101% of the principal amount of such 2027 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. However, the 2027 Notes also include a change of control portability feature whereby the Company does not have to make an offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes (and holders of the 2027 Notes do not have the ability to require such repurchase), so long as the change of control qualifies as a Permitted Change of Control. In order to qualify as a Permitted Change of Control, on the date of the change of control: a. The Company’s Moody’s corporate rating must be B3 (stable) or better, and the Company’s S&P corporate rating must be B (stable) or better; and b. The Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio is equal to or less than 7.00x. In addition, the Company also entered into the Eighth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement (Amendment No. 8), which amends the Credit Facility to obtain a delayed draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan) with a borrowing limit of up to $250.0 million. The Delayed Draw Term Loan constitutes a separate class from the Company’s existing term loan facility and is not fungible with the Company’s existing term loan facility. The Company intends to use proceeds from any future borrowings to fund future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The commitments of lenders to fund under the Delayed Draw Term Loan is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain leverage ratios, the accuracy of certain representations and other customary conditions. The Delayed Draw Term Loan was issued at a discount of 100 basis points, totaling $2.5 million and is scheduled to mature on October 22, 2024. Borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, Base rate or LIBOR rate available at the time of borrowing. The Delayed Draw Term Loan may be drawn up to nine times at any time on or prior to the date that is two years after the closing date, May 13, 2019. Each borrowing is subject to quarterly amortization payments, whereby 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loan are repaid on the first full quarter following the date of funding. Similar to the First Lien Term Loans, the remaining aggregate principal of all Delayed Draw Term Loans will be payable in full on the maturity date. Repayments and prepayments may not be reborrowed. On June 2, 2020, the Company entered into the Twelfth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement (the Twelfth Amendment), which amends the credit facility for the First Lien Term Loans and the New Revolver. Through the Twelfth Amendment, the Company borrowed an additional $300.0 million in First Lien Term Loans, which were issued at a discount of 200 basis points which approximated $6.0 million. The incremental borrowings were used to repay existing borrowings under the New Revolver Loans and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing of approximately $5.1 million. The Company accounted for the incremental borrowings from the Twelfth Amendment as a new debt and capitalized related the debt issuance costs. Certain key terms for the incremental borrowings were different from the terms on the existing first lien term loans. The applicable margin, which is 3.5% for the existing first lien term loans, was priced at 4.5% subject to a 1% LIBOR floor. In addition, the Twelfth Amendment contains a twelve-month call provision for the incremental borrowings (as opposed to a nine-month soft call for the existing first lien term loans). In the event the Company encounters a prepayment event prior to the twelve-month anniversary of the effective date of the Twelfth Amendment, the Company is required to pay the greater of a call premium of 1% of the outstanding incremental first lien borrowings through the Twelfth Amendment or the make-whole premium amount, which is defined by the Twelfth Amendment. The incremental borrowings from the Twelfth Amendment is subject to 0.25% of quarterly principal amortization payments beginning June 30, 2020 and matures on February 13, 2027. The Twelfth Amendment did not contain any changes to the First Lien Term Loans that existed prior to the Twelfth Amendment. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows: A reconciliation of Level 3 fixed maturity securities that have been measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs is as follows: As of November 11, 2020, the Company has yet to engage a valuation expert or otherwise determine the allocation of the fair value of the purchase price of any acquisitions occurring after September 30, 2020. However, the nature of all the businesses acquired is similar in all material respects to the acquisitions previously completed by the Company, and as such the Company expects the purchase price to be allocated in a similar manner.
