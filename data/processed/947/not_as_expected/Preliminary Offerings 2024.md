**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM**

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers
and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum
and the offer and sale of the notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the notes are
delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable laws
and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission
required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction
to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers
will have any responsibility therefor.

By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties
and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial
purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted. You
should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite period of
time.

This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be
accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss
in this offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such
documents, our business and the terms of this offering and the notes, including the merits and risks involved.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering
memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to
be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in
connection with their consideration of the purchase of the notes and (2) in offshore transactions complying with Rule
903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering
memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only be distributed and disclosed to the
prospective investors to whom it is provided by us or by the initial purchasers.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy
of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on the initial
purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of
such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from
registration under the Securities Act and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any
representations concerning us, this offering or the notes described in this offering memorandum, other than as
contained in this offering memorandum.

We and the initial purchasers make no representation to you that the notes are a legal investment for you.
You should not consider any information included in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice.
You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding
an investment in the notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this
offering memorandum implies that any information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date
after the date of this offering memorandum.

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.


-----

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason and to allot to any
prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor. We are making this offering subject
to the terms described in this offering memorandum and the indenture (the “Indenture”) to be entered into by the
Issuer, the guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

The notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the notes sold pursuant to this offering
memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which will be deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC for the accounts of its participants, including Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear
Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and registered in its name or in the name of Cede
& Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global
certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants)
and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global certificates).
After the initial issuance of the global certificates, notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global
certificates only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that
stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes at a higher level than the notes might otherwise achieve in the open
market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see
the section “Plan of Distribution” in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum is strictly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the proposed offering of the notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is
personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for
or otherwise acquire the notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and
those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and
any disclosure of any of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this
offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering
memorandum or any documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum.

All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31.


-----

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this offering memorandum have been
subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic
aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or,
as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

Unless otherwise noted, the historical financial information included in this offering memorandum is derived
from the consolidated financial statements of AssuredPartners.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We refer to the terms organic revenue growth, EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free
Cash Flow in various places in this offering memorandum. These are supplemental financial measures that are not
prepared in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. Any analysis of non-GAAP
financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these
measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry (including companies that we have acquired
or have entered into binding agreements or letters of intent to acquire and for which we have included non-GAAP
financial measures in this offering memorandum) and, accordingly, such measures as used in this offering
memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and
estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our presentation of organic revenue growth, EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA,
Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an inference that our future results will
not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, our calculations of EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and the
related ratio data may differ from our calculations of “Consolidated EBITDA” and the related leverage ratios under
the Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture.

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of “nonGAAP financial measures,” such as organic revenue growth, EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue
and Free Cash Flow and any ratios or margins related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of
methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial
measures are publicly presented and require, among other things:

    - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and

    - a statement disclosing the purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

    - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required
cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure; and

    - the adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the
past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with the SEC
rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. For example, some of the adjustments to EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition Adjusted


-----

EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue and Free Cash Flow as presented in this offering memorandum may not be
allowed under SEC rules.

In addition, we include estimates in this offering memorandum of revenue and adjusted EBITDA of various
companies or businesses that we have acquired or have signed letters of intent to acquire. These estimates are based
on due diligence conducted by management and reflect an estimate of the revenue or adjusted EBITDA, as applicable,
that each such company or business would have contributed during the relevant period presented, assuming that such
company or business had been acquired on the first day of such period. Our estimates of revenue and adjusted
EBITDA do not comply with GAAP.

Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data” for a further discussion and
quantification of non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum, including the reasons that we
believe this information is useful to management and to investors and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures
to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

In certain circumstances in this offering memorandum, we present amounts for existing indebtedness as gross
amounts prior to amortization (without giving effect to any discount, fee or commission) and total net debt and secured
net debt, which is total debt or secured debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. These metrics do not comply
with GAAP.

**MARKET SHARE, RANKING AND INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS**

This offering memorandum includes market share, ranking and industry data and forecasts that we obtained
from industry publications and surveys, public filings and internal company sources. Each such source speaks as of
its original publication date (and not as of the date of this offering memorandum) and the opinions expressed in such
publications, surveys and forecasts are subject to change without notice. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts
generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there
can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information included in this offering memorandum.
We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources, nor have we ascertained the underlying
economic assumptions relied upon therein. Statements as to our market position and ranking are based on market data
currently available to us, management’s estimates and assumptions we have made regarding the size of our markets
within our industry. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding our industry data presented herein, our
estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed
under the heading “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. Neither we nor the initial purchasers can guarantee
the accuracy or completeness of such third-party information contained in this offering memorandum.

**_Our Company_**

We are one of the largest, fastest-growing, full-service insurance brokers in the United States, offering a
broad range of property and casualty (“Property & Casualty” or “P&C”) and employee benefits (“Employee Benefits”
or “EB”) insurance products and services to middle-market businesses, public institutions and high-net worth
individuals. We have achieved significant growth in a highly fragmented and consolidating industry through a
disciplined acquisition program that targets accretive acquisitions and by focusing on generating organic growth and
profit margin expansion. In the United States, we were the eleventh largest insurance broker and the fifth largest
independent P&C insurance broker, each based on brokerage revenues generated in 2022. We have a highly
diversified revenue base with high revenue and producer retention rates. For the twelve months ended September 30,
2023, we generated total revenue of $2,462.9 million, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA of $847.9 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of $878.9 million. For definitions of Standalone Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and related
reconciliations to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and footnote
(2) in “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data.”

We operate our business through two segments, Retail and Accretive. Our Retail segment focuses on P&C
and employee benefits, with our P&C offerings including standard / admitted P&C commercial and personal lines
products, and specialty product niches. Accretive focuses on specialty programs, wholesale, and managing general
agents (“MGAs”) and was formed from existing AssuredPartners’ businesses in 2022 to expand distribution of
services, centralize expertise, and better address specialty and emerging market risks. We believe we are one of only
a few insurance brokers with both national scale and a strong local presence within its markets. Our organizational
structure is comprised of our corporate headquarters, which develops our overall growth strategy and other initiatives,
identifies cross-selling opportunities, coordinates knowledge-sharing across markets and performs general
administrative oversight and accounting, legal and information technology functions, as well as regional leadership,
responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the offices within its region, identifying acquisition prospects,
and integrating smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have all the benefits of a national brokerage network, such as
economies of scale, operating efficiencies and greater influence in carrier relationships, while retaining the deep local
knowledge of our producers. As of September 30, 2023, we operated approximately 360 offices in 40 states across
the United States, the District of Columbia, United Kingdom (“UK”), Ireland and Belgium with approximately 1,500
producers

**_Our Products and Services_**

We offer an extensive portfolio of more than 300 products and services from more than 3,000 insurance
company partnerships to over 800,000 clients, as of September 30, 2023. No material part of our business depends
upon a single customer or on a few customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our top client
accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues, while our top ten clients represented approximately 4% of our
total revenues. We serve a variety of industries, such as real estate, construction, public entities, healthcare and senior
living, manufacturing, forestry, life sciences, hospitality, asset management, entertainment, technology, non-profit,
retail, trade and others. Our segments are:

    - _Retail: Our Retail segment focuses on P&C and EB. P&C offerings include standard / admitted P&C_
commercial and personal lines products and specialty niches. We offer a full range of commercial lines
products covering over 25 specialty niches. The segment consists of 12 industry and product verticals,


-----

including Agribusiness, Aerospace, Education, Real Estate, Captives, Transportation, Senior Living,
Construction & Surety, Manufacturing, Government Contractor, Energy and Mergers & Acquisitions.
Personal lines offerings focus on complementary products for high net worth business owners, which
includes higher-end homes, secondary homes, valuable articles and yachts. EB provides end-to-end
consulting and administration services for fully-insured and self-insured plans, including Brokerage,
Consulting & Analytics, Communications, Employee Advocacy, and Benefits Administration. The
Retail segment accounted for 73% of revenue and drove 7.2% of organic growth for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and included approximately 1,400 producers across over 300 offices.

    - _Accretive: Our Accretive segment focuses on programs, wholesale, and MGAs. This segment was_
formed from existing AssuredPartners’ businesses in 2022 to expand distribution of services, centralize
expertise, and better address specialty and emerging market risks and is composed of 26 specialty,
wholesale and MGA platforms. Accretive provides a full scope of insurance value chain intermediary
capabilities and creates attractive acquisition opportunities within the highly fragmented specialty
distribution and wholesale markets. Accretive also provides the ability to design new products and
programs and place risks for increasingly complex client needs. The Accretive segment accounted for
27% of revenue for the nine months and drove 5.2% of organic growth ended September 30, 2023 and
included approximately 140 producers across over 60 offices. Producers for our Retail segment may also
refer or sell products for our Accretive segment as well.

The following charts illustrate the percentage of revenues generated from each product line for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023:

**_Our Competitive Strengths_**

We believe our following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us well
to profitably grow our business:

_Leading Middle-Market Broker in an Attractive Industry with Strong Fundamentals._ We are a leading
insurance broker, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. We focus on the middle-market
segment of the insurance brokerage industry, which is largely served by smaller regional and local firms who typically
focus on relationship selling and often lack the size and scale to leverage large premium relationships with insurers.
We believe our national scale and strong expertise, combined with our flexible organizational structure and strong
local relationships, will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position within the U.S. middle-market segment
of the insurance brokerage industry.

_Highly Diversified Revenue Base. Our revenue base is highly diversified across product lines, geographies,_
clients and producers, which limits our exposure to changes in industry and sector volatility, regional market
fluctuations and individual producer performance and reduces our reliance on any individual client relationship. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our top client accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues, and
our top ten clients represented approximately 4% of our total revenues. Through our revenue-generating relationships
with more than 1,800 insurance carriers, we are able to provide our clients with an expansive portfolio of products


-----

and services at competitive prices and increase our negotiating leverage. For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, no single insurance carrier represented more than 5% of our total revenue.

_High Producer and Revenue Retention. Our average producer retention rate and revenue retention rate has_
exceeded 90% and 95%, respectively, in each of the last three years. To retain our key producers, we have developed
a compensation and incentive structure, including long-term equity-based retention and incentive programs, that aligns
our producers with our growth goals and invested in sales leadership recognition and training programs and initiatives
to educate and motivate our producers. In addition, our producers typically sign two-year customer non-solicit and
no-hire agreements, while owners of acquired businesses are required to sign non-compete agreements that run five
years from the date of acquisition. We believe our low producer turnover rate, together with our strong, long-term
customer relationships, provides us with increased visibility regarding future revenues.

_Strong Free Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently_
delivered strong free cash flows, driven by high Standalone Adjusted EBITDA margins, low working capital and light
capital expenditure requirements, which have averaged less than 2% of revenue over the last three years. In addition,
as a result of our many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases, we also benefit from large amounts
of tax-deductible amortization expense. We believe that strong free cash flow generation affords us opportunities to
strategically invest in our business and to access debt capital, allowing us to fuel growth both organically and through
continued strategic acquisitions.

_Proven Executive Leadership Team with a Long-Term Track Record of Value Creation. Led by Jim_
Henderson, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Randy Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Vredenburg,
our President and Chief Operating Officer, our senior management team has considerable insurance brokerage
experience, with an average of 35 years of experience in the insurance brokerage industry, and is operationally
focused. Our senior management team has successfully grown our business through a series of disciplined acquisitions
and organic growth initiatives. We believe our management has the vision, experience and network of relationships
to continue our successful growth.

**_Our Business Strategies_**

We intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:

_Continue to Pursue Highly Accretive Acquisitions. We plan to continue growing our business by selectively_
entering new regional markets and expanding our product and service portfolio through sustained execution of our
disciplined and selective acquisition strategy. Our dedicated eighteen-person in-house M&A team is exclusively
focused on leveraging our senior management’s deep industry relationships to source proprietary and highly accretive
opportunities that meet our stringent criteria. This approach, combined with our brand reputation, the reputation of
our senior executives and our team-oriented and entrepreneurial environment, has allowed us to attract high-quality
insurance agencies to join our organization. We have a strong track record of completing acquisitions for which letters
of intent have been signed, with a successful completion rate of approximately 93% based on the revenues of the
companies and businesses targeted over the past three years. Since 2016 to September 30, 2023, we have successfully
executed and integrated 301 acquisitions of agencies and books of businesses, with annual combined revenues and
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, for the most recent fiscal twelvemonth period prior to the date of consummation of each acquisition. The acquisitions completed from 2016 to
September 30, 2023 had an attractive average upfront purchase price multiple of 10 times. We continue to pursue a
robust acquisition pipeline, with signed letters of intent for 15 brokerage acquisition prospects as of January 26, 2024.

_Sustained Focus on Organic Revenue Growth. Led by our Chief Revenue Officer, we continue to focus on_
organic revenue growth through producer recruitment efforts and by restructuring our compensation and performance
model to optimize our existing sales force. We have initiated regional and national sales contests to incentivize selling
efforts, developed clear company-wide benchmarks and expectations for our producers as part of an annual review
process, and instituted company-wide enhanced onboarding and training programs designed to develop talent and
promote long-term relationships with producers. We experienced 7.2% and 5.2% organic revenue growth for the
Retail and Accretive segments, respectively, with a total of 6.7% organic revenue growth, each for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we have also invested in the development of industry-specific verticals, such


-----

as senior living, transportation, aviation, construction, architect and engineering, in order to increase retention of
existing business and facilitate growth of new business.

_Achieve Operational Efficiencies and Margin Improvements. We strive to increase margins both through_
revenue growth initiatives (through both the growth of new business as well as improvement in revenue retention) and
proactive expense management. We had approximately $2,462.9 million of total revenue for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023, which increased approximately 17.1% compared to the prior year period, and we believe that our
revenue growth initiatives will allow us to continue to grow our revenues. We have sought to improve our cost
structure by increasing standardization across our organization by using centralized information technology,
accounting centers, human resources, purchasing and real estate management. To optimize our cost structure, we have
established target sales levels and operating costs across our offices and product lines. We regularly review the
efficiency metrics and margins across our company to identify underperforming offices, producers and product or
service lines. We also have a team of highly seasoned insurance agency operators who travel throughout the regions
in which we operate to assist our local and regional leaders in identifying and executing strategies to capitalize on
opportunities for operational improvements.

**_The Transactions_**

In connection with the offering of the notes, we expect to enter into an amendment to our Credit Agreement
(the “Credit Agreement Amendment”), to (i) incur $500.0 million of incremental term loans that will mature on the
date that is seven years after the date of the Credit Agreement Amendment (such incremental term loans, the “Term
B-5 Loans”), (ii) extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to August, 2028 (the “Extended Revolving
Facility Maturity Date”); provided that if, as of November 14, 2026 (the “Springing Maturity Date”), more than $500
million of the term loan facilities (other than the Term B-5 Loans) remain outstanding and have not been extended to
a date on or after the Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, the Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date shall
instead be the Springing Maturity Date and (iii) increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility
from $414.5 million to $600.0 million. We expect to enter into the Credit Agreement Amendment substantially
concurrently with the closing of this offering, but there can be no assurance that we will so on the terms described
herein or at all. The effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment is not a condition to the issuance of the notes
offered hereby. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

We use the term “Transactions” throughout this offering memorandum to collectively refer to (a) the issuance
and sale of the notes offered hereby, the borrowing of the Term B-5 Loans and the application of the net proceeds
therefrom, including to repay certain of our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, fund the 2025
Notes Redemption (as defined below) and pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, with the remainder
to be used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, funding certain acquisitions currently under
letters of intent, and (b) the Credit Agreement Amendment. See “—Recent Developments—2025 Notes Redemption”
and “Use of Proceeds.”

**_Recent Developments_**

_2025 Notes Redemption_

In connection with this offering, we have issued a notice of conditional redemption providing for the
redemption of all of the outstanding Existing 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.000% of the principal

Redemption”), subject to the completion of this offering. Any redemption of the Existing 2025 Notes will be made
solely pursuant to a redemption notice delivered pursuant to the Existing 2025 Indenture, and nothing contained in
this offering memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the Existing 2025 Notes.

_2023 Incremental Amendment_

On October 6, 2023, we entered into that certain Nineteenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment
Agreement (the “2023 Incremental Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we incurred $400
million of incremental term loans under our term loan facility. The proceeds from such incremental borrowing were


-----

used to finance certain acquisitions, for other general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the foregoing. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

_2023 Revolver Draw_

We have presented approximate numbers for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023

December 31, 2023 and therefore are not able to provide our actual results. The financial data for the three months
and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 presented above is preliminary, based upon our estimates and is subject
to revision based upon our financial closing procedures and the completion of our financial statements. Prior to the
finalization of our financial closing procedures, we are currently unable to determine the nature of potential
adjustments to be made and, if such adjustments are made, the precise extent of those adjustments. Our actual results
may be materially different from our estimates. In addition, these estimated results are not necessarily indicative of
our results for the full fiscal year or any future period. The preliminary financial data included in this offering
memorandum has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, AssuredPartners’ management.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures
with respect to the preliminary financial data. Accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

**_Corporate Structure_**

The following chart illustrates our organizational and debt capital structure as of September 30, 2023, on an
as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions. The following chart reflects our effective ownership
structure but has been condensed and does not include all of the entities in the Issuer’s corporate structure.

(1) Holdings is a guarantor under the senior secured credit facilities, but is not a guarantor of the Existing Notes and
will not be a guarantor of the notes offered hereby.

(2) AssuredPartners is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities and the issuer of the Existing Notes and
the notes offered hereby.

(3) As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the 2023
Incremental Amendment, we would have had $5,103.4 million of senior secured term loans outstanding under
our term loan facilities. Certain of the existing term loan facilities will mature in February 2027. The Term B-5
Loans contemplated by the Transactions will mature seven years after the closing date of such Term B-5 Loans.
At December 31, 2023, there were approximately $4,591.6 million in outstanding senior secured term loans giving
effect to the completion of an add-on acquisition financing that closed on October 6, 2023. See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(4) Our existing revolving credit facility provides for aggregate commitments of $414.5 million and matures on
August 13, 2026. As of September 30, 2023, we had availability of $414.3 million under our existing revolving
credit facility after giving effect to $0.2 million in outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the proposed


-----

Credit Agreement Amendment, we are seeking to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit
facility from $414.5 million to $600.0 million. See “—The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds” and “Description
of Certain Other Indebtedness.” As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, we had availability of $599.8 million under our amended revolving credit facility after giving
effect to $0.2 million in outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis
after giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to use approximately $164.4 million from cash on hand and/or
borrowings under the revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions currently pending under signed letters of
intent that are expected to close by April 17, 2024.

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect
to the Transactions. We expect to use net proceeds from the Transactions, in part, to fully redeem the Existing
2025 Notes. Nothing contained in this offering memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the Existing
2025 Notes. See “—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

(6) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby.

(7) Subject to certain exceptions, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis,
jointly and severally, by each wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the senior secured
credit facilities or that, in the future, guarantees certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any guarantor, including
certain capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any guarantor. To the extent lenders under the senior
secured credit facilities release any guarantor from its obligations, such guarantor will also be released from its
obligations under the notes.

(8) The notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-wholly-owned, unrestricted or non-U.S. subsidiaries. On an
as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have
accounted for an immaterial portion of our total revenues and income from operations, in each case, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and would have accounted for an immaterial portion of our consolidated total
assets and total liabilities, in each case, as of September 30, 2023.

and future secured indebtedness, including the obligations under the senior
secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness; and

                - be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.

As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the
Transactions:

                - we would have had, on a consolidated basis, total indebtedness and other
liabilities of approximately $6,629.5 million, including $5,104.3 million of
senior secured indebtedness;


-----

                - we would have had an additional $599.8 million of availability to incur
secured indebtedness under our amended revolving credit facility (after
giving effect to $0.2 million of outstanding letters of credit and, for the
avoidance of doubt, assuming the aggregate commitments under our
revolving credit facility are increased to $600.0 million pursuant to the
Credit Agreement Amendment); and

                - for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries would have accounted for an immaterial portion of our
consolidated total revenues and consolidated income from operations and,
as of September 30, 2023, would have accounted for an immaterial portion
of our consolidated total assets and total liabilities.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—The notes
will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future
subsidiaries that are not and do not become guarantors of the notes.”

Optional Redemption ............ The Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any
time on or after          , 2027, at the redemption prices set forth herein, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time prior to          , 2027, the Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole
or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, plus an applicable “make-whole” premium.

At any time prior to          , 2027, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the Indenture in an amount not
exceeding the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price
equal to           % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In connection with any offer to purchase all or any of the notes, if holders of no less
than 90% of the principal amount of the notes validly tender their notes, the Issuer is
entitled to redeem any remaining notes at the price offered to each holder.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Change of Control ................. If a specific kind of change in control occurs, the Issuer may be required to offer to
repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase.

We may not, however, be able to pay you the required price for the notes you present
to us at the time of a change of control because:

                - we may not have enough funds at that time; or

                - the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Existing Indentures, the Indenture or
other debt facilities may prevent us from making such payment.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We may not
be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture.”

Asset Sale Offer .................... If the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to


-----

purchase the notes at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Certain Covenants ................. The Indenture will contain certain covenants that, among other things, will limit the
Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to:

                - incur additional debt, guarantee debt or issue certain disqualified stock and
preferred stock;

                - create liens;

                - pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase equity;

                - prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments;

                - transfer and sell assets;

                - engage in a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of their assets; and

                - enter into transactions with affiliates.

These covenants are subject to a number of important detailed exceptions and
qualifications, which are described under “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

In addition, certain of the covenants will be suspended if any two of Moody’s, Fitch
and Standard & Poor’s assign the notes an investment grade rating in the future and
no default exist under the indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Effectiveness of Covenants.”

Form and Denomination ....... The notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and
in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Transfer Restrictions; No
Registration Rights ............ The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any
other applicable securities laws. The notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state or local securities laws. We
do not intend to issue registered notes and guarantees in exchange for the notes and
the guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may
adversely impact the transferability of the notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

No Prior Market .................... The notes will be new securities for which there currently is no market and the notes
will not be listed on any securities exchange or quoted on any quotation system.
Although the initial purchasers have informed the Issuer that they intend to make a
market in the notes, such initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may
discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or be maintained.

Use of Proceeds .................... The Issuer expects to use the net proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds
from an incremental borrowing under the term loan facilities to repay certain of our
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, redeem all of our Existing
2025 Notes and pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, with the


-----

remainder to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to,
funding certain acquisitions currently under letters of intent. The Issuer also plans to
extend the maturity date and increase the aggregate commitments under our
revolving credit facility. See “Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Recent
Developments—2025 Notes Redemption” and “Use of Proceeds.”

Trustee .................................. U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association.

Governing Law ..................... The notes and the Indenture will be governed by the law of the State of New York.

Risk Factors .......................... See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks you should carefully consider before
deciding to invest in the notes.

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data**

The following table sets forth our summary historical consolidated financial data as of the dates and for the
periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial statements of operations and balance sheet data as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent auditors, whose report
on these financial statements is included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary historical
consolidated financial statements of operations and balance sheet data as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022 are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for such periods
included in this offering memorandum which contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that
management considers necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the
periods presented. The historical results included below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum are not
necessarily indicative of our future performance. The summary historical consolidated financial data should be read
in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited financial statements of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 was
derived for each line item presented by subtracting the line item in our unaudited consolidated financial statements for
the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from the line item from our consolidated financial statements for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and adding the amount of the line item from our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

information on these acquisitions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Business Combinations.”

This amount is based on good faith estimates of management derived entirely from financial information
provided by the management of the respective companies acquired in the relevant acquisition prior to our


-----

ownership and control of such companies. Accordingly, although we believe such information to be accurate,
such information cannot be independently verified by our management, nor has such information been
independently reviewed or audited. We cannot assure you that the financial statements of companies we have
acquired or will acquire would not be materially different if such statements were audited. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—This offering memorandum includes financial information
prepared by other entities that has not been independently reviewed or audited.”

(b) Represents the revenues of the various companies or businesses acquired by us during the period between
October 1, 2023 and January 26, 2024, as if such acquisitions had been consummated on the first day of the

(c) Represents the revenues of the various companies or businesses for which acquisition letters of intent have

these acquisitions will close by April 17, 2024. However, there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will
close or the timing thereof. If the acquisitions do not close, we will not benefit from the expected impact to our
Acquisition Adjusted Revenue. We expect to fund these acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under
our revolving credit facility.

(2) EBITDA, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions, Acquisition
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with
GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. We believe these financial measures give investors meaningful
information to help them understand our operating results and to analyze our financial and business trends on a periodto-period basis. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented
in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported
under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

     - they (other than Free Cash Flow) do not reflect costs or cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

     - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

     - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments,
on our debt;

     - they do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

     - they do not reflect certain impairments and adjustments for purchase accounting;

     - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our
ongoing operations;

     - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often
have to be replaced in the future, and these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash requirements for such
replacements; and

     - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures and the related ratios should not be considered as
measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness. See “Non-GAAP
Financial Measures.”

(6) As further adjusted secured net debt represents total debt (exclusive of unamortized discounts and deferred financing
costs) that is secured of $5,105 million less estimated cash and cash equivalents of $450.5 million as of January 26, 2024,
in each case, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions. As further adjusted cash and cash
equivalents give effect to the use of approximately $164.4 million from cash on hand and/or borrowings under the
revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions currently pending under signed letters of intent that are expected to close
by April 17, 2024. As further adjusted cash and cash equivalents does not reflect any issue discounts and commissions
in connection with this offering. See “Capitalization.”

(7) As further adjusted total cash interest expense is calculated assuming the interest rate on the notes offered hereby and
after giving effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on the first day of the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023.

(8) The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions to total cash interest expense is determined by dividing Adjusted
EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions by total cash interest expense. Our calculation of this ratio may differ under the Credit
Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following_
_risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this offering memorandum, before you decide_
_whether to purchase the notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties_
_that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also_
_may impair our financial condition and business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our_
_business’s financial condition and operating results would suffer and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations_
_under the notes. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ_
_substantially from those discussed in those forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding_
_Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**_Risks Related to our Business_**

**_We may experience unexpected fluctuations in our commission revenues because our commissions depend on_**
**_premium rates charged by insurance carriers, which we do not control and which historically have varied and have_**
**_been difficult to predict, which may negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and cash flows._**

We derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance carriers. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we derived approximately 92.0% of our total revenue from commissions paid by insurance
carriers on the sale of insurance products to our retail and wholesale clients. Such commissions paid to us are
calculated based upon a percentage of premiums paid to insurance carriers by customers for insurance products that
we place and therefore any decreases in premium rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations. The
potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the insurance market. We have no
control over the premium rates on which our commissions are calculated because premium rates are determined by
insurance carriers based on a number of factors, including the relative underwriting capacity of the insurance industry,
economic conditions, prevailing legislation, historical and expected loss experiences, capital availability and the
availability of alternative insurance products, such as governmental benefits and self-insurance plans, to consumers.
In addition, property and casualty premium rates have historically been cyclical. The amount of commissions we earn
is therefore highly dependent on factors beyond our control.

Because we cannot determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast
our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. If premiums decline or commission rates
are reduced, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. As a result, we may
have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other
expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues.

**_Profit-sharing contingent commissions paid by insurance carriers are less predictable than core commissions,_**
**_which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive._**

We derive a portion of our revenues from profit-sharing contingent commissions paid by insurance carriers.
Profit-sharing contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance carriers based upon
the overall underwriting results, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such insurance carriers during the
prior year. We primarily receive these commissions in the first half of each year because they are calculated and paid
in the year following the year in which the premium is generated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we
derived approximately 8.0% of our total revenue from such profit-sharing contingent commissions.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and potential changes in underwriting criteria if
insurance carriers experience high loss ratios, we cannot predict the timing and amount of these profit-sharing
contingent commissions. Further, we have no control over the process by which insurance carriers estimate loss
reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations. If we are unable to meet insurance carriers’
profit or volume goals, or if insurance carriers increase their estimate of loss reserves over which we have no control,
actual payments we receive may be less than anticipated. Any decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions may
adversely affect the results of our operations, cash flows and our financial condition.


-----

**_Our business and results of operations depend on decisions and actions by insurance carriers and trends in the_**
**_general insurance industry, which are beyond our control._**

Our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and
provide coverage, which, in turn, is significantly dependent on insurance carriers’ ability to procure reinsurance. We
have no control over these matters. For example, there have been changes in the reinsurance market making it more
difficult for insurance carriers to obtain reinsurance coverage for life insurance, resulting in changes to the design and
pricing of universal life insurance policies that may reduce their attractiveness to clients. To the extent that reinsurance
becomes less widely available, we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers
desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited. In addition, if a significant insurer
fails or withdraws from writing certain lines of coverage that we offer to our clients, we could lose clients or be unable
to place insurance, and our revenues would be adversely affected. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
no single carrier accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue, with the top ten carriers in the aggregate representing
approximately 24% of our total revenues. In addition, traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers have, in the past,
outsourced, and will likely continue to outsource, the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated insurance
brokers or agents such as us. To further reduce their expenses, these insurance carriers may seek to reduce the
commission rates payable to non-affiliated insurance brokers or agents. The reduction of these commission rates, in
addition to general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. The general level
of economic activity can have a substantial impact on our revenues which is difficult to predict, and a strong economic
period may not necessarily result in higher revenues.

Total insurance volumes have historically been influenced by the state of the overall economy, which is
influenced by a variety of factors, including energy costs, geopolitical issues such as the conflicts between Russia and
Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar global health crisis, inflation,
the availability and cost of credit and slow economic growth in the United States. The specific impact of the economy
on our revenues can be difficult to predict. When our clients are adversely impacted by declining economic or business
conditions, they may reduce their purchases of insurance and risk advisory services to reduce expenses. In addition,
reductions in our clients’ headcount, payroll, properties and the market values of assets could also adversely impact
our commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium
adjustments. Similarly, our employee benefits business may be adversely impacted as businesses downsize and reduce
headcounts and payrolls and therefore reduce insurance coverage or increase their deductibles. In addition, an increase
in the number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry,
could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance
business. Conversely, when the economy is strong, insurance coverage typically increases as payrolls, inventories
and other insured risks increase, and therefore insurance commissions would also be expected to increase. However,
the higher commission revenues we generally would expect to see in a strong economic period may not necessarily
occur, as any increase in the volume of insurance business brought about by favorable economic conditions may be
offset by premium rates that have declined in response to increased competitive and loss conditions, among other
factors. Further, our business is also impacted by general trends in the insurance industry, such as the growing
availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. Corporations have demonstrated a
greater willingness to “self-insure,” including the use of captive insurers, and the advent of capital markets-based
solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs, which in turn could reduce the demand for products and
services we sell.

**_We face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our_**
**_business may be materially adversely affected._**

We face competition in all markets in which we operate, primarily based on product breadth, innovation,
quality of service and price. We compete with a number of insurance brokerages who may have greater resources
than we do and as a result, these competitors may be able to identify trends more quickly or withstand an economic
downturn and/or declining premium rates better than we can. In addition, over the last several decades, large insurance
brokerages, new private equity-backed brokerages and publicly traded companies in the financial services industry
have been acquiring and consolidating small- to medium-sized independent brokerages to offer insurance products
and services and to strengthen their market share. Some insurance carriers are engaged in the direct sale of insurance,
primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers on policies they sell directly. If we are
unable to compete effectively against our competitors, we will suffer a loss of market share, decreased revenue and


-----

reduced operating margins. Further, competition may reduce the fees that we can obtain for services provided, which
would also have an adverse effect on revenue and margins.

In certain markets we compete directly with locally owned insurance brokerages and privately owned
regional insurance brokerages. Because relationships between insurance brokerages and insurance carriers or
customers are often local or regional in nature, we may be competitively disadvantaged in areas in which we do not
have a significant local or regional presence.

Furthermore, recent technological advancements have resulted in increased competition from Internet-based
specialty insurance brokerages that specialize in niche insurance markets and may be able to offer better pricing due
to their lower cost structure. There has also been an increase in alternative insurance markets, such as self insurance,
captive insurance (i.e., arrangements where the policyholder owns the insurance company), rent-a-captive
arrangements, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions. While we compete in these
segments on a fee-for-service basis, we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of
profitability as traditional insurance markets.

**_If our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit_**
**_opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability._**

We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for understanding our
clients’ needs and delivering high-quality brokering and risk management solutions tailored to satisfy those needs. If
a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur costs and impair our profitability. Many of our
clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information
among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one
client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple clients. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual
obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.

The nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual
outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our consulting business, we may be
evaluated by clients based on our track record regarding judgments and advice that are susceptible to influences
unknown at the time the advice was given. If our assumptions and estimates turn out to be inaccurate, a client may
claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our advice and we could be exposed to liability, increased costs of defense
and insurance premiums, as well as negative publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect
our ability to secure new business.

**_We may be unsuccessful in identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition candidates or integrating acquired_**
**_insurance brokerages, which could impede our growth and ability to remain competitive in our industry._**

Maintaining our current pace of growth is primarily dependent on our ability to successfully acquire and
integrate insurance brokerages in new and existing markets. However, we may not successfully identify suitable
acquisition candidates or there may not be any prospective acquisition candidates. In addition, we may not be able to
successfully complete an acquisition after identifying a candidate. We sometimes compete for acquisition and
expansion opportunities with entities that have greater financial resources or are otherwise willing to pay more than
we are. We face higher risks if our acquisition strategy requires us to seek additional financing, as our ability to obtain
additional financing on satisfactory terms and conditions will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are
beyond our control.

Even after a successful acquisition of a business, we may be unable to successfully integrate such acquired
business with our existing business and operations or the business may not perform in accordance with the projections
that informed the purchase price for such acquisition. The integration of an acquired business involves a number of
factors that may negatively affect our operations, including, but not limited to:

    - distraction of management or lack of leadership within the acquired business to succeed retiring leaders;


-----

    - significant costs and difficulties, including implementing or remediating controls, procedures and
policies at the acquired company, integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource
and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, and sales and marketing functions,
transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms, as well as retention of key
personnel;

    - tax and accounting issues, including the creation of significant future contingent liabilities relating to
earn-outs for acquisitions or other financial liabilities; and

    - unanticipated problems or legal liabilities.

In addition, our due diligence with respect to the business and operations of each of the brokerages we acquire
may not have identified all material facts concerning these brokerages. Unanticipated events or liabilities relating to
these brokerages could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
Furthermore, once we have integrated an acquired brokerage, it may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or
productivity comparable to our existing business, or otherwise perform as expected.

We cannot assure you that past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our
operational or strategic expectations. In addition, due in part to the decentralized nature of our operations, once we
have acquired a business, we may not be able to effectively monitor controls, especially transaction review and
monitoring activities, of such businesses. Our failure to successfully acquire and integrate businesses may cause us
to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities
and/or harm our business generally, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow.

**_Quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net_**
**_effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations._**

Our commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and override commissions) can
vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production
due to factors that are not within our control. Specifically, customers’ demand for insurance products can influence
the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (including policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. In
addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment of contingent commissions, which are processed internally
by these insurance companies and may not be timely received by us in a particular quarter or year until after the end
of that period. Because we are unable to control the timing of the payments, we may not be able to accurately forecast
these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures. Additionally, insurance underwriters or their
affiliates may under certain circumstances seek the chargeback or repayment of commissions as a result of policy
lapse, surrender, cancellation, rescission, default, or upon other specified circumstances. As a result of the chargeback
or repayment of commissions, we may incur an expense in a particular period related to revenue previously recognized
in a prior period and reflected in our financial statements. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on
increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals, and any chargebacks or repayments sought,
may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be able to successfully implement our various growth strategies and initiatives._**

Our growth strategy also includes a focus on driving organic growth, which involves the expansion of our
platforms through the development of, and investment in, our existing lines of business. In particular, we have
intensified our producer recruitment efforts and restructured aspects of our compensation and performance model to
optimize our existing sales force. In addition, we have also implemented performance improvement initiatives across
our insurance brokerage operations, with a focus on optimizing certain selling and administrative expenses, as well as
IT initiatives to better track and report sales and evaluate performances across our organization.

Our future growth depends, in large part, on our ability to successfully implement these strategies. If we fail
to successfully implement these strategies or if any of these strategies ultimately proves unsuccessful, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.


-----

**_Our business is highly concentrated in certain states and adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in_**
**_these states could adversely affect our financial condition._**

A significant portion of our business is concentrated in California, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania,
Maryland and Illinois. The insurance business is primarily a state-regulated industry. Because our business is
concentrated in the states identified above, we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions
in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states.
In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, or other circumstances specific
to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_Economic conditions could result in financial instability for financial institutions that hold our operating and trust_**
**_cash and cash equivalents, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition_**
**_and cash flow._**

As an insurance broker, we collect premiums paid by clients and hold such cash, net of our earned
commissions and other deductions, in trust until we remit the cash to the applicable insurance carriers that provide
coverage to our clients. Our operating and trust cash balances are held at financial institutions and are generally
invested in money market accounts, depository accounts or federal securities and, in some cases, are in excess of U.S.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. There can be no assurance that these financial institutions would be
viable in the event of a systemic failure of the global banking infrastructure. If our access to operating and trust cash
balances is temporarily or permanently limited, we may experience a significant liquidity problem and a material
adverse impact on our business, including potential disciplinary action, criminal penalties, fines, damage to our
reputation and financial harm resulting from our failure to satisfy fiduciary regulatory requirements with respect to
trust cash balances.

**_A substantial portion of our total assets are represented by goodwill and other intangible assets and may be further_**
**_increased as a result of future acquisitions and, under accounting standards, we may be required to write down the_**
**_value of our goodwill and other intangible assets._**

A significant portion of our purchase price and the purchase price for insurance brokerages that we have
acquired has been allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. The amount of purchase price allocated to goodwill is
determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired.

Under GAAP, we are required to conduct an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets. We conduct impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Deterioration in our operating results,
including the loss of a significant client or clients, could result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangible assets, which would result in us having to record an impairment charge to write-down the fair value of
goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. In addition, GAAP requires us, on an ongoing basis, to evaluate our
definite-lived intangible assets for any indicators of impairment. If we were to identify an indicator of impairment we
may have to record an impairment charge to write-down the fair value of the definite-lived intangible asset.

Further, the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporates quantitative data and qualitative
criteria including new information and judgments that can dramatically change the decision about the valuation of an
intangible asset in a very short period of time. The timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could
vary if management’s conclusions were different. Such impairment charges could adversely affect our net earnings,
operating results or financial position.

**_Our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to scrutiny by various_**
**_governmental authorities._**

The business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry have from
time to time come under scrutiny by various governmental authorities due to the potential for conflicts of interest.
Potential conflicts of interest can arise in the insurance intermediary industry in a number of scenarios, including:
(i) when an intermediary is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions, whether


-----

relating to profit-sharing contingent commissions arrangements or otherwise; or (ii) when an intermediary is
potentially incentivized to steer a client towards products or a carrier that provide a better compensation arrangement
to the intermediary. The legislatures and insurance departments of various states have adopted various laws and
regulations addressing contingent commission arrangements and may in the future adopt new laws and regulations,
including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds. In the past
there have been governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment
practices, including practices similar to ours. Further, some insurance companies have agreed with regulatory
authorities to end the payment of contingent commissions on insurance products. If our clients seek alternatives to
our products and services and/or determine they will no longer make payments of contingent commissions to us, our
business and results of operations will be adversely affected.

While we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future governmental inquiries and investigations or the
responses by the market and government regulators, as well as any new laws or regulations that may be enacted, any
unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations. Such new laws and regulations
or resolution of any governmental inquiries or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business and
in particular could lead to a decrease in our contingent commissions, which would have a material adverse impact on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Government regulation and resulting market dynamics relating to the group health plans we sell could negatively_**
**_affect our results of operations and cash flows._**

From time to time, new regulations are enacted, or existing requirements are changed, and it is difficult to
anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced. During 2010, the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (together, the “2010
Health Care Reform Legislation”) were signed into law. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other
things, increased the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their
employees. As an employee benefits broker, we provide our clients access to group health insurance products and
services, as well as advice on benefit plan design for their employees; therefore, our clients are impacted by the 2010
Health Care Reform Legislation. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they
are enacted. If, however, we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent
healthcare regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services will be negatively impacted.
Other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include federal and state governments establishing
programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other
alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by
insurance carriers. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response
to this law, it could have a material effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products and
services we sell and on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Further, certain employee benefits products we sell currently have a favorable tax treatment, such as the
deductibility of expenses related to health insurance plans or the tax-free build-up of cash values and the tax-free
nature of death benefits of life insurance products. A change in the tax treatment associated with such plans or
products, or adverse determinations or guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) relative to such plans or
products, could affect the demand for employee benefits products and thereby adversely impact our business and
results of operations.

**_Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors_**
**_and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings._**

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to
alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance and/or the provision of
services in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial
amounts of money, including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert,
errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.
Claimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal and defense
costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on
allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of


-----

customers, provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or
appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis.

While most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have been covered by our professional
indemnity insurance (subject to our deductibles), our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be
adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or if there is an
increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts
and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for
such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our
reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.

**_We are subject to legal proceedings that, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, results of operations or financial condition._**

We are and may be subject to a number of claims, regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of business. We cannot, and likely will not be able to, predict the outcome of these claims, actions
and proceedings with certainty. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual
period. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation
and cause harm to our carrier, customer or employee relationships, or divert personnel and management resources.

Our potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of
our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive
damages, may not be covered by insurance. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become
unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.

**_We compete in a highly regulated industry, which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our_**
**_operations._**

We are subject to legal requirements and governmental regulatory supervision in the United States, the United
Kingdom and in each state and province in which we conduct business. The laws of the various state jurisdictions
establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing of
entities to transact business, licensing of agents, admittance of assets, regulating premium rates, approving policy
forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards,
requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms, and restricting payment of dividends. In
addition, although the federal government does not directly regulate the P&C insurance industry, we are also subject
to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including, among others, employee benefit plan
regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination that affect the insurance industry generally.

There can be no assurance that more restrictive laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future
that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the
federal government, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us. In addition, recently adopted
federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry
in the coming years, which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations.

Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision by these authorities may vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory
authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. This supervision generally includes the
regulation and licensing of insurance carriers, intermediaries and others making available insurance products or
services; the regulation of financial solvency of insurance carriers, including by establishing reserve requirements and
requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms; the regulation of unfair trade and claims
practices, including the handling and permitted investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity by industry
participants; and the regulation of market conduct, including compensation arrangements between intermediaries, on
the one hand, and carriers and clients, on the other hand. These activities may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations that adversely affect


-----

our business. Our ability to conduct our business in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our
compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these
jurisdictions. More restrictive laws, rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance
more difficult and expensive.

Further, we are required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act and
other anti-corruption laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, which generally prohibit, among other
things, providing or offering anything of value to foreign officials and other officials for improper or corrupt purposes.
We are also subject to economic and trade sanctions and embargo laws, orders, and regulations, including those
administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other
applicable sanctions authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which prohibit us from engaging in business
with certain foreign countries, territories, entities, and individuals. Although we believe that we are in compliance
with all applicable sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be in
compliance in the future, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could negatively impact our business,
our results of operations, and our financial condition. Failure to comply with these laws (either due to our own acts
or our inadvertence, or due to acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third-party partners or agents)
could result in civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, significant costs and/or reputational harm.

Our clients have the right to file complaints with regulators about our services, and these regulators may
investigate and require us to address such complaints. Our failure to satisfy regulators or the legal requirements
governing our activities can result in disciplinary action, criminal penalties, fines, damage to our reputation and
financial harm. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in
administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications
at various locations or information systems, which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our
business.

**_We have non-U.S. operations which expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various other risks that could_**
**_impact our business._**

A portion of our operations are conducted in the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to legal,
economic and market risks associated with operating in a foreign country, including devaluations and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates.

In addition, operating outside the United States may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the
risks we face doing comparable business in the United States. These include, among others, risk relating to:

    - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including the coordination of our
communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during
times of crisis management;

    - less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing
with us after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their
employment;

    - political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);

    - adverse trade policies and adverse changes to any of the policies of the United States or any of the foreign
jurisdictions in which we operate;

    - adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions; and

    - governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States.

If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.


-----

**_Improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business._**

We have access to confidential and proprietary information, primarily relating to current and prospective
clients, potential acquisition targets, as well as personal data of our employees and employees of our clients. We are
responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of this information. We depend on computer systems, software,
networks, and other technology assets to access, process and store information about our clients, some of which is
private and subject to regulatory requirements. Although we have put in place certain safeguards designed to protect
the security and privacy of this information, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses,
malware, ransomware, demands for ransom, phishing or other attacks by hackers, employee or contractor malfeasance,
human error and similar intrusions. Such cybersecurity attacks or breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns
or unauthorized access to information maintained in our information technology systems and in the information
technology systems of our vendors and other third parties. In the case of a successful ransomware attack in which our
data and information systems are compromised and applicable restore control processes to restore access are not
effective, our information could be held hostage until a ransom, which may be significant, is paid. We have in the
past been subject to, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity attacks and breaches of our information
technology systems. Further, like others in the insurance industry, the Company may be under greater threat from
cybercriminals seeking sensitive personal or other insurance-related information. Additionally, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented temporary adjustment of work schedules, allowing employees
to work from home and adopt remote collaboration. As a result of these measures, and as Company employees
continue to work from home and access the Company’s systems remotely, the Company may be subject to heighted
information security risks, including the risk of cyber attacks. Further, the Company cannot entirely eliminate the
related costs associated with or incurred by the Company to mitigate the consequences from such security and privacy
incidents. If the Company’s systems or facilities were infiltrated or damaged or if the Company was unable to prevent
unauthorized account access and transactions, the Company’s clients could experience data loss, financial loss and
significant business interruption leading to a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition
and results of operations. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to remedy, modify
protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications
to stakeholders, regulators, media and impacted individuals. The use of electronic communications, mobile
technologies and social media by employees, clients and third parties, and the speed at which information can be
widely distributed, increases the risks associated with the intentional or unintentional distribution of confidential,
sensitive, or proprietary information, and personal information, and the potential for unauthorized access and
transactions.

Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are
not discovered until they have been launched against a target. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, we may
be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect breaches for long periods of time or implement preventative measures.
Our third-party contractors who handle information also may experience security breaches involving the storage and
transmission of proprietary and sensitive personal information. If unauthorized parties gain access to our services or
our networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive third-party
information. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, or be subject to regulatory actions for
breaching privacy rules, which could result in litigation, civil penalties, government investigations or adverse publicity
that could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.

The Company is subject to laws, regulations and contractual obligations relating to the collection, use,
retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personal information and confidential, sensitive or proprietary data. Our
own actual or perceived failure, or the failure of third-party vendors with whom we do business, to comply with these
obligations could harm our business. Privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are
inconsistent among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Federal and state legislators are proposing new and more
robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. For
example, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial
Services Companies (“NYS Cyber Regulation”) which became effective March 1, 2017. The NYS Cyber Regulation
applies to those Company subsidiaries and personnel licensed as insurance agents in New York by expanding
obligations and imposing specific requirements for cybersecurity efforts. On November 1, 2023, the New York
Department of Financial Services released finalized revisions to the NYS Cyber Regulation, which will require the
implementation of additional reporting, governance, and oversight measures. In addition, the National Association of


-----

Insurance Commissioners finalized the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “NAIC Model Law”) in 2017, which
is based largely on the NYS Cyber Regulation. Once adopted by the various states, the NAIC Model Law will establish
significant requirements for insurance industry licensees. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which
took effect on January 1, 2020, is a further example of the increasing costs of privacy compliance our business faces
and the potential for increased liability in the event of noncompliance or a data breach. Under the CCPA, California
residents have a number of new rights that are enforceable by the California Attorney General (for example, rights to
access and deletion of personal information), as well as a private right of action in the event of a data breach. The
CCPA also establishes a private right of action that has potentially significant statutory damages; businesses that fail
to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breach of personal information could be directly liable
to affected consumers. The CCPA provides an exemption for personal information collected, processed, sold or
disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the main federal privacy law governing financial institutions.
Given this exception, we are largely exempt from many of the requirements of the CCPA. However, the California
Privacy Rights Act, which is intended to augment and expand the CCPA by imposing additional obligations and
limitations on covered business’ use and sharing of certain personal data, came into effect in January 2023, and many
other states have passed or are considering comprehensive data privacy laws that are similar to the CCPA, including
the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and
Online Monitoring Act. the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act, the Oregon
Consumer Data Protection Act, the Tennessee Consumer Data Protection Act, the Iowa Consumer Data Protection
Act, the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, and the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act. We anticipate that
similar laws will continue to be proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more
stringent data privacy legislation in the United States. These new laws may impose obligations similar to or more
stringent than those we are subject to under other data protection laws. Further, this legislation may add additional
complexity, requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, may require additional investment in and for our to
compliance programs, could impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, and could result in
increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.

Specifically, on August 27, 2023, the Company’s subsidiary Keenan discovered certain disruptions occurring
on some Keenan network servers, which was determined to be an incident resulting from ransomware. Due to the
nature of the incident, Keenan was obligated to provide legally required notices regarding the incident to a number of
its business partners and their respective employees and to certain government agencies. The Company continues to
monitor the situation and the notification process is ongoing. Further, the Company has been notified that it is the
subject of two class action lawsuits with respect to the foregoing ransomware incident. The ultimate outcome of any
litigation or related proceedings with respect to the ransomware incident is unknown at this time. The Company may
become party to additional complaints as a result of the incident.

Additionally, the Company’s operations in the United Kingdom are subject to compliance with the Data
Protection Act 2018 (the United Kingdom’s implementation of the European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation) and any changes that may be made thereto after the United Kingdom is fully withdrawn from membership
in the European Union. These initiatives and changing regulations could increase the cost of developing,
implementing or securing our servers, software applications and cloud storage and requires us to allocate more
resources to improved cybersecurity technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to or
successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to
our reputation. Additionally, if we expand our international operations, the cost and complexity of compliance, and
the associated risks of noncompliance, with data privacy and data security laws, regulations and contractual obligations
will further increase.

**_Intellectual property is important to the Company, and the Company may be unable to protect and enforce our own_**
**_intellectual property or may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others._**

The Company’s proprietary trademarks, technology and other intellectual property is important to the
operation of our business. However, we may not have the ability to protect our intellectual property from all
unauthorized use and disclosure by others. Further, we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently
developing products and services that are similar to ours. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to protect and
enforce our intellectual property rights, including the possible initiation of expensive and protracted litigation, and we
may not prevail. Any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business
and our ability to compete, and in some cases such effect could be material.


-----

We may be subject to claims by third parties that our products, services and technologies infringe on their
intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could cause us to spend
significant time and money to defend ourselves, regardless of the merits of the claims. If we are found to infringe any
third-party intellectual property rights, we could have to pay significant monetary damages or fees and could otherwise
incur reputational harm or substantial time and expense to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid the
infringement.

**_We are controlled by the Sponsors, and their interests may potentially differ in certain material respects from your_**
**_interests._**

By reason of their direct and indirect majority ownership interest in Parent, GTCR and Apax each have the
ability to designate three managers of The AssuredPartners Group GP, LLC (f/k/a GTCR (AP) Acquisitions LLC), a
Delaware limited liability company (“Parent GP”) formed by the Sponsors as the general partner of Parent. As a
result, the Sponsors have designated a majority of the board of managers of Parent GP. The Sponsors have the power
to control our affairs and policies, including amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of
significant transactions, including mergers, sales of all or substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary
transactions. You should be aware that the interests of the Sponsors may differ from yours in material respects. For
example, the Sponsors may cause us to take actions or pursue strategies that they believe may enhance the value of
their equity investment but could impact our ability to make payments under the Indenture. In addition, to the extent
permitted under the Indenture, the Credit Agreement and the Existing Indentures, the Sponsors may cause us to pay
dividends from available dividend capacity under the Existing Indentures and this Indenture and advisory fees rather
than make capital expenditures or repay debt.

The Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time in the
future, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are
suppliers or customers of ours, or that may be complementary to our business, and as a result of which such acquisition
opportunity may not be available to us. So long as affiliates of the Sponsors continue to own a significant amount of
our outstanding equity, the Sponsors will be able to significantly influence or control our decisions.

**_Our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain management members and key personnel and_**
**_any loss of such members or personnel could negatively impact our business._**

We are dependent upon the continued service and performance of Randy Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer
and member of the Board of Directors, and Paul Vredenburg, our President, Chief Operating Officer and member of
the Board of Directors, other members of the senior management team and other key producers. If we are unable to
hire and retain key management and sales professionals, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The
insurance brokerage industry continues to experience intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers
and brokerage teams, and we have occasionally lost key individuals and teams to competitors. If key sales
professionals were to end their employment with us, or if we experience significant turnover among our key sales
professionals, it could negatively affect the execution of our business strategy and marketing and other objectives,
disrupt our client relationships, and have a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
Similarly, if for any reason members of our senior management do not remain with us, our operations could be
adversely affected until suitable replacements with appropriate experience can be found. If we fail to recruit and retain
top producers, our organic revenue growth, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be
adversely affected.

Substantially all of our managers and sales professionals are subject to employment agreements containing
post-employment restrictive covenants that prohibit the solicitation or acceptance of business for a reasonable period
of time following employment. In the past, some of these managers and sales professionals have challenged the
enforcement of these restrictive covenants upon resignation or termination of their employment. Many state and
federal court judges, particularly in California, have shown increasing reluctance to grant us equitable relief to prevent
wrongful solicitation or acceptance of our business by these former producers. Additionally, some state legislatures
in the states where we operate have introduced, and in some cases passed, state laws making it more difficult to enforce
these restrictive covenants. These laws and the judicial interpretation of these laws are in constant flux and normally
trend in a direction that makes enforcement more challenging. Conversely, we also face the risk when hiring key


-----

producers from competing agencies that they may be subject to post-employment restrictive covenants entered into
with their former agencies.

The cost associated with this type of litigation, as well as the potential loss of business to former sales
professionals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**_Our corporate structure and strategy of operating through decentralized insurance brokerages may make it more_**
**_difficult for us to become aware of and respond to adverse operating or financial developments at our insurance_**
**_brokerages._**

To implement and monitor our business plan and determine and report our operating results, we depend on
timely and accurate reporting of business conditions, including legal, regulatory and financial results, from our
brokerages. We have internal controls and communication procedures in place to receive ongoing communications
from our various regional management teams. However, if an adverse business or financial development occurs at
one or more of our brokerages, or if one of our brokerages were to report inaccurate financial information, we may
not become aware of the occurrence in a timely manner, which could make it more difficult for us to effectively
respond to that development and could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our exposure and determine and report
our financial results.

**_We could fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls and, consequently, may not be able to accurately_**
**_meet our reporting obligations._**

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Because of changing conditions, such as the integrations of acquisitions, the effectiveness of our internal
controls may vary over time and we must continue to maintain and upgrade our internal controls. Significant costs
are involved with maintaining our technology and internal control infrastructure. If we are unable to efficiently and
effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our internal
controls may become ineffective or vulnerable. Any failure in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to execute
our business strategy and our ability to deliver accurate and timely financial information.

We are not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and therefore are not currently required
to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting under these requirements and we do not intend to voluntarily
comply with these requirements. However, in 2021, the Company identified a material weakness related to the initial
adoption of ASC 606 in 2019. The existence of material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls that we
have not detected could result in the decline of investor confidence in our financial reports and the trading price of the
notes could be adversely impacted.

**_Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of_**
**_operations._**

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting
principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also
required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting
period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to
commissions and fees, contingent revenue, recoverability of assets including customer and carrier receivables,
contingencies including earn-out consideration payable, share-based payments, the measurement of fair value of
derivative financial instruments, the measurement of self-insured liabilities, restructuring, income taxes and litigation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on
specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially affect our
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, financial position, shareholders’ equity and cash flows.
Changes in accounting standards (such as new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases) could also have
an adverse impact on our future consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can
materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could


-----

be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial
statements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical
Accounting Policies.”

**_We rely on third parties to provide services, and their failure to perform these services could do harm to our_**
**_business._**

We rely on a number of third-party service providers. These providers include, but are not limited to, insurers,
plan trustees and payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees or on behalf of employees,
and providers of data and information, such as software vendors, health plan providers, investment managers and
investment advisers, that we work with to provide information to clients’ employees. Those providers also include
providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers employed by us in connection with our human
resources business processing services delivered to our clients. These service providers are located both domestically
and offshore. Failure by third-party service providers to perform in a timely manner, particularly during periods of
peak demand, could cause us to be unable to deliver our services to our clients, result in contractual or regulatory
penalties, liability claims from clients and/or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business.  We
periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no guarantee that such terms
will remain acceptable to us, such third parties or regulators. If third party providers experience disruptions, fail to
meet applicable licensure requirements, do not perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, terminate or fail to renew our relationships, or such third-party providers in turn rely on services from
another third-party provider, who experiences such disruptions, licensure failures, nonperformance or noncompliance,
termination or nonrenewal of its contractual relationships, the Company may experience operational difficulties, an
inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, contractual, legal, regulatory or customer obligations), a
loss of business, increased costs or reputational harm, compromises to our data integrity, or suffer other negative
consequences, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_If we are unable to recover from a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity, including an_**
**_interruption in information technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations including material_**
**_financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability._**

Our ability to conduct business depends on our capacity to store, retrieve, process and manage centralized
transaction systems and databases and periodically expand and upgrade our information processing capabilities to
maintain the technological infrastructure capable of supporting our growing operations and acquired businesses.
Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, breakdown or
malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems, telecommunications failure or damage caused by fire,
tornadoes, lightning, and electrical power outages, disruptions caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist
activities, material cybersecurity attacks, natural or man-made disasters, disease pandemics or other disruption at these
centralized locations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Disruptions to our technology
infrastructure could potentially cause us to lose client data or experience a material adverse interruption to our
operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario, which could result in regulatory actions,
reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. Our disaster recovery procedures in place and
insurance to protect against such contingencies may not be effective, and any insurance or recovery procedures may
not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible
loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Failure to successfully maintain
our infrastructure to support our growth or to implement appropriate disaster recovery procedures should we
experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our
operations.

**_If we are unable to apply technology effectively, our client relationships, product and service offerings, growth_**
**_strategy, compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected._**

If we do not keep up with technological changes, our business and results of operations could be adversely
affected. In many of our business lines, our ability to remain competitive and differentiate our services to clients may
in part depend on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to a competitive landscape driven by the
development and adoption of new technologies and methodologies. Our competitors are seeking to develop or
incorporate technological solutions into their business, and their success in this space may impact our ability to


-----

differentiate our services to our clients. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement
technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry
standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding
to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace.
Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop or implement new technologies in our business
requires us to incur significant expenses. While we are devoting significant resources to investments in technology
systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy, our competitors may have greater financial resources than
we do and may be able to pursue more technology initiatives or identify and develop or implement new technologies
faster than we can. If we cannot effectively identify and develop or implement new technologies as quickly as our
competitors, or if our competitors develop or implement more cost-effective technologies, we could experience a
material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results.

**_We are subject to risks relating to the captive insurance business of Meritage._**

As part of our acquisition of Keenan & Associates (“Keenan”) in March 2017, we acquired Meritage
Insurance Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Keenan (“Meritage”), which was formed under the captive
insurance company laws of the State of Hawaii. Although Meritage’s captive insurance business constitutes an
immaterial part of our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we
suffer significant losses under Meritage’s captive insurance business that materially exceed the reserves established
for such losses. We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by Meritage.
While we believe these reserves are adequate and above compliance levels required by the State of Hawaii, new
information, events or circumstances, unknown at the original valuation date, may lead to Meritage’s ultimate losses
being significantly greater or less than the reserves. There are many factors that could cause the amount of reserves
to be insufficient to cover the related losses, including changes in claim severity, changes in the expected level of
reported claims, judicial action changing the scope and/or liability of coverage, changes in the legislative, regulatory,
social and economic environment and unexpected changes in loss inflation, none of which are within our control. If
Meritage’s ultimate losses are significantly greater than its reserves, our financial condition and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

**_A deterioration in general economic, business, geopolitical or industry conditions could materially adversely affect_**
**_our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows._**

Concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, including the conflicts between
Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar global health
crisis, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and slow economic growth in the United States have contributed to
general economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Additionally, acts of protest and
civil unrest have caused economic and political disruption in the United States. Meanwhile, continued hostilities in
Europe and the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries
could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. A deterioration in the economic climate
in the United States or abroad could materially adversely affect our operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**_Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness_**

**_Our substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and_**
**_our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business._**

We have, and after consummation of this offering will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness.
As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had,
on a consolidated basis, total debt (including current portion) of approximately $6,629.5 million, including $5,103.4
million of senior secured indebtedness, and we would have had an additional $599.8 million of availability to incur
secured indebtedness under our amended revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $0.2 million of outstanding
letters of credit and, for the avoidance of doubt, assuming the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit
facility are increased to $600.0 million pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment).

This high level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including, but not limited
to:


-----

    - we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to outstanding debt obligations;

    - we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, acquisitions, capital
expenditures or other purposes;

    - we may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available excess cash flow to pay interest and
principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and
other business activities, including, but not limited to, working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital
expenditures or other general corporate or business activities;

    - our debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry
conditions;

    - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - some of our debt has variable rates of interest, and to the extent such debt is not swapped at a fixed rate,
we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates;

    - our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in
our industry in general;

    - our substantial amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place
us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

    - our clients or insurance carriers may react adversely to our significant debt level; and

    - our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which,
among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt
and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material
adverse effect on our business or prospects.

Our ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to
make future principal and interest payments in respect of our indebtedness depends on, among other things, our
operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly
affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Our
cash flows may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, and
meet our other obligations.

**_We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing_**
**_liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which_**
**_may be unsuccessful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned
acquisitions, capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial and operating
performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business,
legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing debt
instruments or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before
maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if
successful, such refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced
to reduce or delay capital expenditures or acquisitions, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our
indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain loans or other debt financings on commercially reasonable


-----

terms or at all. Even if successful, these alternative measures may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service
obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The
Credit Agreement and Existing Indentures restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and
use the proceeds therefrom to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may be unable to
consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and the proceeds that we
do receive may be inadequate to meet any debt service obligations when due. See “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

Additionally, if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the
notes and the Existing Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders
under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan additional money to us, the lenders
could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
All of these events could result in your losing all or a part of your investment in the notes.

In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness
is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by
dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances,
legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Except for subsidiaries
that are or become guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or our
other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. The agreements governing the current and future
indebtedness of our subsidiaries may not permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions
or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on these notes when due. The Credit Agreement and
Existing Indentures restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and
otherwise transfer assets to us. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries to make the
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, holders of our indebtedness could
declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and you could lose all or a portion of your
investment in the notes.

**_We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. This could further_**
**_exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the Credit Agreement and Existing Indentures,
and that will be contained in the Indenture, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional
indebtedness incurred while still in compliance with these restrictions or following a waiver of these restrictions could
be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could
intensify.

**_The Credit Agreement and Existing Indentures contain, and the Indenture will contain, a number of restrictive_**
**_covenants which will limit our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs or engage in other_**
**_business activities that may be in our interest._**

The operating and financial covenants and restrictions in the Credit Agreement and Existing Indentures
impose, and the Indenture will impose, operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions
affect or will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain
of our subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness;

    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our equity securities;


-----

    - redeem our equity securities;

    - make certain investments or certain other restricted payments;

    - transfer, lease or sell certain kinds of assets;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated indebtedness;

    - designate restricted or unrestricted subsidiaries;

    - enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and

    - effect mergers or consolidations.

In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with a first-lien secured leverage ratio under
specified circumstances. Our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control.

The restrictions referred to above could limit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions
or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance
our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business
activities that would be in our interest. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required
financial ratios could result in a default under all or certain of our debt instruments. An event of default under the
Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to
extend further credit under the senior secured credit facilities. If a default occurs, the applicable creditors of our
secured debt could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which constitutes
substantially all of our domestic and foreign, wholly owned subsidiaries’ assets. In the event our lenders under the
senior secured credit facilities or holders of the notes or Existing Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings,
we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest
rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase
even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available
for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. A one-eighth percentage point change in the interest
rate associated with our outstanding variable rate indebtedness as of September 30, 2023 (assuming our revolving
credit facility were fully drawn on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions (including the
Credit Agreement Amendment)) would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately $2.7 million,
and any floating for fixed rate swaps we have entered into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_We will need to repay or refinance borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the Existing Notes_**
**_prior to maturity of the notes. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon us._**

Under our senior secured credit facilities, the existing term loans will mature in February 2027, our amended
revolving credit facility will mature in August, 2028 (the “Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date”); provided
that if, as of November 14, 2026 (the “Springing Maturity Date”), more than $500 million of the term loan facilities
(other than the Term B-5 Loans) remain outstanding and have not been extended to a date on or after the Extended
Revolving Facility Maturity Date, the Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date shall instead be the Springing
Maturity Date, our Term B-5 Loans will mature seven years after the closing date of such Term B-5 Loan, our Existing
2027 Notes will mature in May 2027 and our Existing 2029 Notes will mature in January 2029. Consequently, prior
to the maturity of the notes, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our senior
secured credit facilities and the Existing Notes. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace or extend will be dependent
on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the financial
markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay the Existing Notes or


-----

indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, we could be forced to undertake alternate
financings, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of our Existing Notes or senior secured credit facilities or sell
assets and delay capital expenditures to generate proceeds that could be used to repay the Existing Notes or
indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any
such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to repay,
refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facilities or the Existing Notes could
result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement and/or the Existing Indentures, which could lead to an
acceleration or repayment of substantially all of our outstanding debt.

In connection with this offering, we have issued a notice of conditional redemption providing for the
redemption of all of the outstanding Existing 2025 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.000% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including, the redemption date (the “2025 Notes
Redemption”), subject to the completion of this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together
with the net proceeds from incremental borrowing under our term loan facility, to repay certain of our outstanding
borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to redeem our Existing 2025 Notes and to pay fees and expenses in
connection with the foregoing, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes including, but not limited
to, funding certain acquisitions currently under letters of intent. We also plan to amend the Credit Agreement to extend
the maturity date and increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility. Any redemption of the
Existing 2025 Notes will be made solely pursuant to a redemption notice delivered pursuant to the Existing 2025
Indenture, and nothing contained in this offering memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the Existing 2025
Notes. See “Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Recent Developments—2025 Notes Redemption” and “Use
of Proceeds.”

**_The notes will be effectively subordinated to our and our subsidiary guarantors’ indebtedness under the senior_**
**_secured credit facilities and any other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the property securing that_**
**_indebtedness._**

The notes will not be secured by any of our or our subsidiary guarantors’ assets. As a result, the notes and
the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to our and our subsidiary guarantors’ indebtedness under the senior
secured credit facilities and any other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral that secures that
indebtedness. As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we
would have had, on a consolidated basis, total debt (including current portion) of approximately $6,629.5 million,
including $5,103.4 million of senior secured indebtedness, and we would have had an additional $599.8 million of
availability to incur secured indebtedness under our amended revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $0.2
million of outstanding letters of credit and, for the avoidance of doubt, assuming the aggregate commitments under
our revolving credit facility are increased to $600.0 million pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment). The
effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of our secured indebtedness,
or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of our company or the subsidiary
guarantors, the proceeds from the sale of assets securing our secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations
on the notes only after all indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities and that other secured debt has been
paid in full. As a result, the holders of the notes may not be able to recover all or any of the principal or interest due
under the notes and may receive less, ratably, than the holders of secured debt in the event of our or our subsidiary
guarantors’ bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization.

Furthermore, if the holders of our secured debt foreclose upon and sell the pledged equity interests in any
guarantor, then that guarantor will be released from its note guarantee automatically and immediately upon such sale.
In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in the guarantors,
it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets
remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims in full. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not_**
**_and do not become guarantors of the notes._**

The notes will be guaranteed by each of our existing and future domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries that
guarantee our senior secured credit facilities or that, in the future, guarantee certain capital markets debt securities,
subject to certain exceptions. Except for such subsidiary guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries, including all of our


-----

non-domestic subsidiaries, will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to
make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The notes
and guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor
subsidiary such that in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any
subsidiary that is not a guarantor, all of that subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to
payment in full out of that subsidiary’s assets before we would be entitled to any payment. The Indenture will, subject
to some limitations, permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on
the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

On an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would
have accounted for an immaterial portion of our consolidated total revenues and consolidated income from operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and, as of September 30, 2023, would have accounted for an immaterial
portion of our consolidated total assets and total liabilities.

In addition, our subsidiaries that provide, or will provide, guarantees will be automatically released from
those guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following:

    - the designation of that subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

    - the release or discharge of the guarantee by such subsidiary guarantor under the senior secured credit
facilities or of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the note guarantee of the
notes by such subsidiary guarantor; or

    - the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all the assets, of that subsidiary guarantor.

The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under
the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances without any action or consent by the holders of the
notes, or the Trustee. If any guarantee is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that
subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether
secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be effectively senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Note Guarantees.”

**_Some of the cash that appears on our balance sheet may not be available for use in our business or to meet our_**
**_debt obligations._**

As an insurance broker, we collect premiums paid by clients and hold such cash, net of our earned
commissions and other deductions, in trust in a fiduciary capacity until we remit the cash to the applicable insurance
carriers that provide coverage to our clients. Our use of trust cash is restricted by contractual obligations and by law
in certain states in which we operate. Such trust cash is shown on our balance sheet under the caption “Trust cash.”
In addition, we also have restricted cash that may be reserved for a specific purpose and therefore not available for
immediate or general business use, which is shown in our balance sheet under the caption “Restricted cash.”
Therefore, the amount of cash that appears on our balance sheet may overstate the amount of liquidity we have
available to meet our business or debt obligations, including obligations under the notes.

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture._**

Under the Indenture, upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase
all of the notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the repurchase date. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because we may
not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that would be tendered upon such event. Our failure
to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the Indenture and a cross-default under
the Credit Agreement and the Existing Indentures. The Credit Agreement also provides that a change of control will
be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt
agreements may contain similar provisions. We cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources available
or that we will be permitted by our debt instruments to fulfill these obligations upon the occurrence of a change of


-----

control in the future. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may
be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes may be limited
by law. To avoid the obligations to repurchase the notes, and events of default and potential breaches of the senior
secured credit facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial
to us.

**_The change of control provisions in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_**
**_important corporate events._**

Subject to certain limitations in the Indenture, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged
recapitalizations, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase
the notes, even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely
affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that
might otherwise constitute a “change of control” under the Indenture will not be deemed to be a “change of control”
if (A) our consolidated leverage ratio is less than a certain specified level and (B) certain specified credit ratings from
Moody’s and S&P are achieved. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control” and “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Change of Control.”

**_Holders of the notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of “all
or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and circumstances.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all
our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_The notes or the guarantees may not be enforceable because of fraudulent conveyance or transfer laws and, as a_**
**_result, you may be required to return payments received by you in respect of the notes or the guarantees._**

The incurrence of the notes by the Issuer and the guarantees by our guarantors (including any future
guarantees) may be subject to review under U.S. federal bankruptcy law or relevant state fraudulent conveyance or
transfer laws if a bankruptcy case or lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of the Issuer or the guarantors (or any
trustee appointed on behalf thereof) or our or their unpaid creditors (as applicable). Under these laws, if in such a case
or lawsuit a court were to find that, at the time the Issuer incurred its obligations under the notes or such guarantor
incurred a guarantee, the Issuer or such guarantor:

    - incurred obligations under the notes or the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding
current or future creditors;

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the notes or the
guarantee;

    - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent;

    - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts and obligations beyond its ability to pay as such
debts and obligations matured (as all of the foregoing terms are defined in or interpreted under the
relevant fraudulent conveyance or transfer statutes),

then such court could avoid the notes or the guarantee of such guarantor or subordinate the amounts owing under the
notes or such guarantee to the Issuer or such guarantor’s presently existing or future debt, or take other actions
detrimental to you.


-----

A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for its obligations under the notes or the guarantee if the Issuer or the guarantor did not substantially
benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. Thus, it may be asserted (and a court may consequently
determine) that the guarantors incurred their guarantees for the Issuer’s benefit and did not themselves receive a direct
or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes, such that they incurred the obligations under the guarantees for less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the
guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the
holders of the notes. If a court were to void a guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the guarantor.
Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if
any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary
guarantor.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law of
the jurisdiction that is being applied in any proceeding, such that we cannot assure you as to what standard a court
would apply in determining whether the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or that a court would
agree with our conclusions in this regard, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine
that an issuer or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including
under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the
issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer or any guarantor’s other debt.
Generally, a company would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt or issued the guarantee:

    - the sum of its debts (including contingent liabilities) is greater than its assets, at fair valuation;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability
on its total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and
matured; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

If a guarantee is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason,
you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent
the Issuer or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. Sufficient funds to repay the
notes may not be available from these other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any; accordingly, in the event
of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. You
may also be required to return payments you have received with respect to such guarantees.

Each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or
transfer. This provision may not be effective (as a legal matter or otherwise) to protect the guarantees from being
avoided under applicable fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws or may reduce the guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. In a Florida bankruptcy court decision (which was
subsequently reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on other grounds), this kind of
provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees.

In addition, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a
time the Issuer or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to such Issuer
or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to
an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such
payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or
guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of equitable
subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the


-----

inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes
and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero or avoided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

It is anticipated that the notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of certain of our subsidiaries. However,
the guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable
law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under a guarantee could be reduced to zero depending on the limitations and
other requirements of applicable law and/or the amount of other obligations of such entity. Further, under certain
circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or other applicable laws could
void the obligations under a guarantee, or subordinate the guarantee to other obligations of the guarantor. See “—The
notes or the guarantees may not be enforceable because of fraudulent conveyance or transfer laws and, as a result, you
may be required to return payments received by you in respect of the notes or the guarantees.” In addition, you will
lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of
Notes—Note Guarantees.”

As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee, could be materially reduced or eliminated depending
upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds
the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or the insolvency
administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and
that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes. In addition, holders of the notes will not be_**
**_entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes under applicable securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements (other than pursuant to Rule 144) of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors.”

We do not currently intend to register the notes or the guarantees. The holders of the notes will not be entitled
to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Holders of notes may be required to bear the risk of their
investment in the notes for an indefinite period of time.

**_We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes._**

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the notes, and there can be no assurance that any
such market will develop. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of
the notes on any automatic quotation system. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that following the
completion of this offering, the initial purchasers currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, the initial
purchasers are not obligated to do so and, even if they do, they may discontinue market-making activities at any time.
If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your notes at their fair market value or at all. If a
market were to develop, the notes could trade at prices that are lower than the initial offering price depending on many
factors, including prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions and our financial condition, performance and
prospects.

**_Because the notes will initially be held in book-entry form, you must rely on DTC’s procedures to exercise your_**
**_rights and remedies._**

We will initially issue each series of the notes in the form of one or more Global Notes (as defined herein)
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on,
and transfers of global notes will be effected only through, the records maintained by DTC. Except in limited


-----

circumstances, we will not issue certificated notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.” Accordingly, if you own a
beneficial interest in a Global Note, then you will not be considered an owner or holder of the notes. Instead, DTC or
its nominee will be the sole holder of each series of the notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts on
the Global Notes will be made to the paying agent, who will remit the payments to DTC. We expect that DTC will
then credit those payments to the DTC participant accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes and that
those participants will credit the payments to indirect DTC participants. Unlike persons who have certificated notes
registered in their names, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not have the direct right to act on our
solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from noteholders. Instead, those beneficial owners
will be permitted to act only to the extent that they have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if
applicable, a DTC participant. The applicable procedures for the granting of these proxies may not be sufficient to
enable owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

Since we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after the offering, we will not be subject to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which, among other things, requires public companies to have and maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review
the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. That Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management assess the effectiveness of those controls on
an annual basis (and provide an auditor attestation of management’s assessment). We will not be required to comply
with these requirements and therefore we will not have comparable procedures in place as compared to public
companies.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required, and are including information that may not be_**
**_permitted to be presented, if this offering were being registered with the SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering this offering of the notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering memorandum does not contain certain
executive compensation information that would be required in a registered offering and adjusts financial measures
that do not comply with GAAP in a manner that may not be permitted in an SEC filing. In addition, we have included
certain financial information that may not be permitted to be presented if this offering were being registered with the
SEC. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “No Review by the Securities Exchange Commission.” We urge
you to consider this factor in connection with your evaluation of your investment in the notes.

**_This offering memorandum includes financial information prepared by other entities that has not been_**
**_independently reviewed or audited._**

The financial information included in this offering memorandum in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA for Closed Acquisitions and Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA with respect to the companies and businesses
recently acquired or to be acquired was prepared by the entities acquired or to be acquired pursuant to applicable
accounting principles for such entities, which may differ from GAAP, and include results for the entities acquired or
to be acquired prior to our ownership and control of such entities. Accordingly, although we believe such information
to be accurate, such information cannot be independently verified by our management, nor has such information been
independently reviewed or audited. We cannot assure you that that the financial statements of entities we have
acquired or will acquire would not be materially different if such statements were audited. In addition, the results of
any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. See
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data.”

**_Ratings of the notes and other factors may affect the market price and marketability of the notes._**

We currently expect that, upon issuance, the notes will be rated by Moody’s and S&P. Such ratings will be
limited in scope and will not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes, but rather will reflect
only the view of each rating agency at the time it issues the rating. An explanation of the significance of such rating
may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings will be issued or remain in
effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the


-----

rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that such ratings
may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events,
such as future acquisitions. Holders of the notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of
a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may
have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the notes. In addition, the condition of the financial
markets and other factors may affect the market price or marketability of the notes.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated investment_**
**_grade by any two of Moody’s, Fitch and S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply during any period in which the notes are rated
investment grade by any two of Moody’s, Fitch and S&P and no default with respect to the notes has occurred and is
continuing. Such covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into
certain other transactions. Although there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, any
suspension of such covenants under the Indenture would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be
permitted when such covenants were in force. Any covenants that cease to apply as a result of the notes achieving an
investment grade rating will be reinstated if the credit rating assigned to the notes later falls below an investment grade
rating. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Effectiveness of Covenants.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our gross proceeds from this offering will be approximately $500.0 million, before
deducting initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions and our expenses related to this offering. We intend to use the
net proceeds of this offering, together with the net proceeds from the Term B-5 Loans, to repay certain of our
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to fund the 2025 Notes Redemption and to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the foregoing, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes including,
but not limited to, funding certain acquisitions currently under letters of intent. We also plan to amend the Credit
Agreement to extend the maturity date and increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility.
See “Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Recent Developments—2025 Notes Redemption” and
“Capitalization.”

Assuming (x) the $75.0 million of outstanding revolving loans that will be repaid in connection with the
Transactions were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and (y) the Transactions were completed as of September
30, 2023, the following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of the consideration in connection with the
Transactions. Actual amounts will differ from these estimates. You should read the following together with the
information included under the sections entitled “Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Recent
Developments—2025 Notes Redemption” and “Capitalization” elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby and does not reflect the initial purchasers’ discount,
fees or commissions.
(2) Represents the principal amount of Term B-5 Loans expected to be incurred under the term loan facilities concurrently
with the closing of this offering. See “Summary—Transactions.”
(3) Represents the aggregate cash consideration to be paid in the 2025 Notes Redemption, excluding accrued and unpaid
interest up to but not including the redemption date. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Summary—Recent
Developments—2025 Notes Redemption.”
(4) Represents amounts to fund acquisitions under letters of intent as of January 26, 2024 and expected to close by April 17,
2024.
(5) Represents the aggregate amount used to repay certain borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of
December 31, 2023, excluding accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
(6) Includes estimated expenses, including initial purchasers’ discounts and legal, accounting, rating agency and other fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

As of September 30, 2023, we had $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 2025 Notes
outstanding. The interest rate on the Existing 2025 Notes is 7.00% and the maturity of the Existing 2025 Notes is
August 15, 2025. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to fund the 2025 Notes Redemption. Nothing
contained in this offering memorandum constitutes a notice of redemption of the Existing 2025 Notes. See
“Summary—The Transactions” and “Summary—Recent Developments—2025 Notes Redemption” and “Use of
Proceeds.”

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or certain of their respective affiliates may be lenders under our term
loan credit facilities and/or revolving credit facility, or may hold a portion of our outstanding Existing 2025 Notes and
therefore may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**Business Organization**

AssuredPartners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. The
AssuredPartners Group LP (the “Parent”) holds all issued and outstanding shares of the equity interest of the Company.
The Parent acts as a holding company and its business operations are conducted through the Company.

**Overview**

We are one of the largest, fastest-growing full-service insurance brokers in the United States (U.S.), offering
a broad range of property and casualty and employee benefits insurance products and services to middle-market
businesses, public institutions, and high-net worth individuals. We have achieved significant growth in a highly
fragmented and consolidating industry through a disciplined acquisition program which targets accretive acquisitions
and by focusing on generating organic growth and profit margin expansion. We were the fifth largest independent
Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance broker, the eleventh largest overall insurance broker in the U.S. based on 2022
revenues. We were the twelfth largest insurance broker globally based on 2021 revenues. We have a highly diversified
revenue base with high revenue and producer retention rates. We offer an extensive portfolio of more than 300
products and services from more than 3,000 insurance company partnerships to over 800,000 clients.

Our product lines are:

  - _Property & Casualty (P&C). P&C products and services are comprised of a full range of insurance lines that_
we offer to its commercial middle-market business clients as well as school districts (Commercial P&C),
which includes property, workers’ compensation, surety bonds, aviation, commercial auto, and professional
liability insurance. P&C coverage is offered to high-net worth individuals (Personal P&C) for significant
assets such as residential property, automobiles, private aircrafts, and yachts. We work with nearly all major
commercial property and casualty insurers and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no carrier
contributed more than 10.0% of the P&C premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
Commercial P&C generated $1.0 billion, or 54.6%, of total revenue while Personal P&C generated $193.3
million, or 10.1%, of total revenue.

  - _Employee Benefits (EB). We place EB products and provides consulting and administrative support services_
on both fully insured and self-insured EB plan structures for employers of all sizes. Other ancillary benefits
such as life, disability, and dental coverage, are also offered to both individuals and groups. We work with
nearly all major medical and ancillary carriers, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, one carrier
contributed more than 10.0% of the EB premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, EB
generated $490.4 million, or 25.5% of total revenue.

  - _Services and Other. We offer a wide variety of services to customers in many different industries. These_
services include, but are not limited to, risk management, consulting, financial planning, and third-party
administration. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 services and other generated $189.4 million,
or 9.9% of total revenue.

**Facts Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Macroeconomic Risks_**

Since the beginning of 2022, inflation levels in the U.S. and on a global scale have steadily increased,
affecting consumer goods, labor costs and energy prices, and creating continued volatility in the global capital markets.
Recent strong economic data suggests continued business growth is driven by increases in US consumer disposable
income and spending levels; however, the impact of higher interest rates and rising prices on consumer goods
continues to be a concern. Continued strength in the U.S. labor market also creates challenges to attract and retain top
talent in most U.S. businesses. The Federal Reserve is monitoring current market data and trends closely to determine
if the increases in the federal funds rate over the last several years have done enough to constrict economic growth
and cool inflation and recession concerns in the US. Prospects of further rate hike or reductions in the next year are
somewhat mixed, due in part to the lack of a clear direction on the Federal Reserve’s next moves.

Historically, we have grown due to its focus on organic revenue growth and acquisitions. We foster a strong,
decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives
accountability for results. The insurance brokerage industry generally benefits from inflation as it generally results in
increases to insurance premiums over the following 12 months which in turn results in increases in commissions. We
believe that insurance coverage and employee benefits are generally a non-discretionary cost of doing business for
most companies, which results in relatively stable demand for insurance and employee benefits products and services
and is expected to continue a trend of organic growth for the Company.

The integration of technology solutions in the insurance brokerage industry continues to be a focus for the
industry. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, provide companies with opportunities
to identify and develop product offerings, target customers, and improve customer experiences. The integration of
acquired entities requires common technologies to enhance reporting and analytic capabilities and leverage operating
efficiencies for meaningful cost savings. With the increased level of hybrid work arrangements by employees, and
remote access to customer data, cybersecurity concerns require the implementation of the latest electronic tools and
infrastructure to ensure data privacy and security.

The placements of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank (SBNY), and First Republic Bank (FRC) into
receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) during the first nine months of 2023 have created
bank-specific and broader financial institution liquidity risk and concerns. These recent events may lead to marketwide liquidity shortages, impair the ability of companies to access near-term working capital needs, and create
additional market and economic uncertainty.

We continue to monitor events that could have a material impact on its business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

**_Industry Conditions and Premiums_**

Our commissions are typically structured as a percentage of premiums paid by its clients. These premiums
are a function of insurance pricing, referred to as “premium rates,” and the total amount of risk insured, referred to as
“exposure.”

_Property and Casualty Market. P&C premium rates have historically been cyclical, based on the relative_
underwriting capacity and profitability of the insurance industry, economic conditions, historical and expected loss
experiences and capital availability. In the absence of a catastrophic loss, there typically is increased competition and
a build-up of capital, with carriers becoming less dependent on underwriting revenues, resulting in an erosion of
premium rates (known in the industry as “soft” markets). A subsequent catastrophic loss then causes carriers who are
less capitalized to exit the market, leading to less competitive underwriting conditions and increasing premium rates
(known in the industry as “hard” markets). The robust underwriting market then attracts increased competition and
results in excess capital availability and a reduction in premium rates, thereby completing the cycle. Hard and soft
markets may also be affected by broad-based trends or by factors affecting individual insurance product lines or
specific geographic areas.


-----

In a soft market, insurance brokerages typically receive decreased commission revenues. However, in a soft
market, insurance buyers in the small and mid-sized markets tend to reduce deductibles, increase their limits of
coverage and purchase new coverage. In contrast, in a hard market, clients generally try to maintain their overall
insurance cost by reducing coverage, self-insuring some risks and maintaining higher deductibles. As a result, the
amount of premium expended by many small and medium-sized businesses and resulting brokerage commission
revenue tends to be less volatile than premium rates. Due to the uncertainty of the current economic environment, we
cannot predict whether rate and exposure increases will continue in the foreseeable future.

_Employee Benefits Market. Demand for group EB products and services is largely driven by employment_
levels, whereas EB premium rates tend to increase with medical cost inflation. As businesses continue to struggle with
pension deficits, healthcare costs and the changing regulatory environment, and as employee benefits become an
increasingly significant expense for businesses, we believe the role of insurance brokerage firms in the employee
benefits market will continue to be important. Since we were founded in 2011, it has operated in a market that has
experienced a modest but steady increase in demand for group employee benefits products and services. This increased
demand together with our sales initiatives for ancillary employee benefits products and services, has led to increased
sales volume-based bonuses from certain carriers.

**_Concentration_**

No material part of our business depends upon a single client or on a few clients. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, our top client accounted for approximately 1% of its commissions and fees revenue, while our
top ten clients represented approximately 4% of its commissions and fees revenue. We serve a variety of industries,
such as real estate, construction, public entities, healthcare and senior living, manufacturing, forestry, life sciences,
hospitality, asset management, entertainment, technology, non-profit, retail, trade and others.

We have relationships with a diverse range of insurance carriers to mitigate its risk of carrier concentration
and reduce the impact of the loss of any individual carrier on its results of operations. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, no single carrier accounted for more than 10% of total commissions and fees revenue, with the
top ten carriers in the aggregate representing approximately 29.4% of commissions and fees revenue.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues. Revenues are typically higher during our first and third
quarters due primarily to the timing of broking-related activities. While overall revenues and the variable component
of compensation expense vary quarterly, in part as a function of the foregoing, remaining compensation expense,
selling expense, administrative expense and depreciation and amortization expense generally tend to be more uniform
throughout the year.

**Key Components of Results of Operations**

**_Revenues_**

We generate revenues primarily from commissions paid by insurance carriers on the placement of property
and casualty insurance and employee benefits products. These commissions include (1) commissions and fees (also
known in the industry as “core commissions” or “base commissions”) and (2) contingent revenue.

_Commissions and Fees. Commissions and fees are determined as a percentage of premiums and generally_
recur annually at the same rate for as long as the insurance is in force. Occasionally, upon request by the client, we
are compensated on a negotiated fee basis, which typically represents a fixed dollar amount determined on an annual
basis. We also generate fee revenues from other services it provides to its clients, such as third-party claims
administration and other risk management and consulting services.

_Contingent Revenue. Under certain circumstances, we receive supplemental revenues (also known in the_
industry as “guaranteed supplemental commissions”) and profit-sharing contingent revenues paid by insurance carriers
that are above the base commissions paid. Supplemental revenues are determined in advance of the contractual period


-----

by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and are eligible to be paid quarterly and/or annually,
with such supplemental revenues accruing monthly throughout the contractual period. Profit-sharing contingent
revenues are determined and paid by insurance carriers after the contractual period, based upon the overall
underwriting results, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such insurance carriers during the contractual
period. We primarily receive profit-sharing contingent revenue payments in the first half of each year as they generally
are calculated and paid in the year immediately following the year in which the premium is generated.

**_Costs and Expenses_**

As a service provider, our largest cost of doing business is compensation expense. Sales producers are
generally paid on a standard formula based on a percentage of their retained revenues and new business revenues. The
remaining compensation is semi-variable in nature and is paid to insurance operations’ employees, such as customer
service representatives and account managers, whose primary responsibility is client service. To a limited extent, we
also incur sub-brokerage expense which represents commissions paid to third-party brokers in connection with cobroker sales. These sub-broker expenses are offset against commissions and fees revenue.

Our other costs of doing business include selling expenses such as travel and entertainment expenses, and
administrative expenses, such as rent expenses and professional fees. Significant non-operating expenses include
interest expense on debt balances, as well as costs relating to acquisitions, such as transaction expenses (including
legal, financing, banking, accounting, and valuation fees in connection with acquisitions), amortization of acquired
intangible assets from acquisitions (including acquired customer lists and non-compete agreements) and changes in
the estimated fair value of earn-out payables. We have significant tax-deductible amortization expense as a result of
many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases. As of September 30, 2023, we have approximately
$4.1 billion of net tax-deductible goodwill and other intangible assets, which are generally amortized over a 15-year
period.

**_Revenues_**

Total revenues increased by $249.4 million, or 14.9%, from $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September
30, 2022, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily driven by
acquisitions, organic growth, and improved sales volume-based bonuses from certain carriers.

**_Expenses_**

_Compensation Expense_

Compensation expense increased by $142.1 million, or 15.5%, from $917.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Overall revenue growth, coupled
with an increase in personnel, largely from acquired insurance agencies, resulted in increases in salary, commission,
bonus, other benefits, and payroll expenses. Our producer commission rates during those periods remained consistent
over the comparable periods.

_Selling Expense_

Selling expense increased by $3.9 million, or 13.6%, from $28.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022, to $32.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to
increased marketing and travel related expenses in 2023 as compared to 2022. Selling expense as a percent of revenues
remained consistent over the comparable periods.


-----

_Administrative Expense_

Administrative expense increased by $39.7 million, or 18.7%, from $211.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 to $251.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily
due to an increase in our technology initiatives, computer software automation, and related expenses.

_Transaction Expense_

Transaction expense increased by $7.9 million from $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022, to $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to larger
acquisitions and transition costs that occurred in 2023 that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2022.

_Increase in Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_

Changes in fair value of earn-out payables, net decreased by $33.0 million, or 62.2%, from $53.0 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
September 30, 2023 valuation reflects revised assumptions due to rising interest rates, increased market volatility, the
stronger US dollar and projections of future performance. Additionally, increases in actual performance relative to
forecasted results of underlying acquisitions subject to earn-out adjustments contributed to higher earn-out liability
valuations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 2023.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20.3 million, or 11.1%, from $183.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, to $204.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
is primarily related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and depreciation from acquired fixed assets. Also, we
continue to invest in its information technology infrastructure which supports its claims management, finance, HR,
sales and agency management systems and operations.

_Interest Expense_

Interest expense increased by $144.2 million, or 68.4%, from $210.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to $355.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily
attributable to interest on new debt and increases in interest rates period over period on existing debt, offset by hedge
income received from swaps which concluded in Q1 2023.

_Accretion on Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_

Accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net decreased by $1.4 million, or 4.1%, from $34.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $33.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net
decrease is directly attributable to the time remaining on the Company’s earn-out payables as of September 30, 2023
compared to September 30, 2022.

_Other Income, Net_

Other income, net increased by $23.8 million from $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022, to $24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an
increase in interest income earned on our operating cash balances as a result of rising interest rates.

_Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes_

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, was 4.0% and 45.0%,
respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to impacts of state taxes and permanent tax
differences. A valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets related to certain state net
operating losses for which it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized. We evaluate the recoverability
of the deferred tax assets on a regular basis based on all available positive and negative evidence.


-----

_Net (Loss) Income_

Net (loss) income decreased by $33.9 million from $14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 to $(19.6) million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the cumulative effect of the
factors discussed above.

to $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increases were primarily driven by acquisitions, organic
growth, and improved sales volume-based bonuses from certain carriers.

_Compensation Expense_

Compensation expense increased by $216.4 million, or 22%, from $979.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Overall revenue growth, coupled with an
increase in personnel, largely from acquired insurance agencies, resulted in increases in salary, commission, bonus,
other benefits and payroll expenses. Our producer commission rates during those periods remained consistent over
the comparable periods.

_Selling Expense_

Selling expense increased by $11.0 million, or 38%, from $28.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were primarily due to increased
marketing and travel related expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021 when we limited travel and related expenses as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Selling expense as a percent of revenues generally remained consistent over the
comparable periods.

_Administrative Expense_

Administrative expense increased by $51.5 million, or 21%, from $242.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to $293.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were primarily due to
an increase in the volume of our business as a result of acquisitions, including increases in IT related expenses, travel
expenses, professional service fees, and occupancy expenses.

_Transaction Expense_

Transaction expense decreased by $7.6 million, or 66%, from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These decreases were primarily due to larger acquisitions
that occurred in 2021 that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2022.

_Increase (Reduction) in Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_

Increase in fair value of earn-out payables, net decreased by $47.2 million, or 53%, from $89.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The December 31, 2022
valuation reflects revised assumptions due to rising interest rates, increased market volatility, the stronger US dollar
and projections of future performance. Additionally, fewer acquisitions occurred during the year ended December 31,
2022 compared to December 31, 2021.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $36.2 million, or 17%, from $215.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021, to $251.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily related
to amortization of acquired intangible assets and, to a lesser extent, depreciation from fixed assets acquired as a result
of the acquisitions consummated during the period. We continue to invest in its information technology infrastructure
which supports its claims management, finance, HR, and agency management systems and operations.

_Interest Expense_

Interest expense increased by $46.8 million, or 18%, from $254.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, to $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to interest
expense associated with rising interest rates in 2022 and our incremental borrowings of $850.0 million in February
2022 and $500.0 million in November 2022, offset by favorable cash flows from our interest rate hedges.

_Loss on Debt Extinguishment_

Loss on debt extinguishment amounted to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The current
period loss is attributable to the write-off of previously capitalized fees for the delayed draw term loan facility which
was paid off using new first lien term loan borrowings in February 2022. No other debt extinguishments occurred
during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

_Accretion on Fair Value of Earn-out Payables, Net_

Accretion on fair value of earn-out payables, net increased by $32.3 million, or 194%, from $16.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is


-----

attributable to rising interest rates impacting active earnout arrangements with higher average fair values in the relative
periods in 2022 compared to 2021.

_Other Income, Net_

Other income, net decreased by $9.3 million, or 66%, from $14.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a legal settlement
received in 2021 that did not reoccur in 2022.

_(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes_

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was (4.6)% and 68.1%, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to impacts of state taxes and permanent tax differences.

A valuation allowance of $7.2 million has been established against the deferred tax assets related to certain
state net operating losses for which it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized. We evaluate the
recoverability of the deferred tax assets on a regular basis based upon all available positive and negative evidence.

_Net Income_

Net income increased by $29.0 million, or 338%, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the cumulative effect of the factors discussed above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Liquidity_**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents on the balance
sheet and funds available under our revolving credit facility and any new debt offerings. These sources of liquidity
are expected to fund short-term and long-term obligations as of September 30, 2023. Historically, our capital
requirements have been for debt service obligations and to fund the acquisition of brokerage operations. The insurance
brokerage industry is generally not capital intensive.

We continue to monitor the impact of the SVB, SBNY, and FRC failures. We do not hold any cash balances
or have any lending agreements with SVB, SBNY, or FRC. We continue to believe it has sufficient assets and liquidity
to adequately cover future obligations under its loan commitments, based on the cash balances maintained by us,
continued availability under the Credit Facility, as well as ongoing principal repayments for debt service.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $350.5 million. As of September 30, 2023 we
had $414.5 million available under its revolving loan credit facility.

As an insurance broker, we collect premiums paid by clients and holds such cash, net of earned commissions and
other deductions, in trust in a fiduciary capacity until we remit the cash to the applicable insurance carriers that
provide coverage to its clients. Our use of trust cash is restricted by contractual obligations and by law in certain
states in which we operate. As permitted by law, we generally hold trust cash in cash and money market accounts
and earns an insignificant amount of investment interest income on trust cash balances during the time between
receipt of the cash from clients and the time the cash is remitted to the insurance carrier. We offset any interest
earned on the trust cash accounts against any fees associated with the accounts. Such cash held in trust is shown
separately on the consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Trust cash.” In addition, we also have restricted
cash that may be reserved for a specific purpose and therefore not available for immediate or general business use,
which is shown in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Restricted cash.” As of September 30, 2023,
we had $225.2 million of Trust cash and $60.5 million of Restricted cash. $57.8 million of the Restricted cash


-----

balance as of September 30, 2023 is related to an appeals bond associated with the AP Keenan matter that is
described further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**_Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities_**

Our operating activities primarily consist of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items including
depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets), changes in estimated acquisition earn-out
payables and payments, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation expense and the effect of changes in
working capital and other activities.

_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022. Net cash provided by_
operating activities was $180.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $205.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily
the result of the year-to-date net loss and an increase in working capital, partially offset by a net increase in estimated
earn-out payables.

_Year Ended December 31, 2022 and Year Ended December 31, 2021._ Net cash provided by operating
activities was $269.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $378.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a decline in
working capital, higher earnout payments and an increase in estimated earn-out payables. This decrease was partially
offset by higher amortization costs and net income.

**_Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities_**

Our investing activities primarily consist of purchases of insurance brokerage business operations, sales or
purchases of books of businesses or client accounts, and purchases of fixed assets.

_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in_
investing activities was $566.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $421.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to an increase in payments for businesses
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

_Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used in investing activities was_
$559.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease is primarily due to fewer insurance agencies being acquired in 2022 as compared to 2021, offset
by an increase in capital expenditures spend.

**_Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities_**

Our financing activities primarily consist of borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities and the
generation or uses of capital sources.

_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022. Net cash (used in)_
provided by financing activities was $(67.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to
$445.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The change in net cash (used in) provided by financing
activities is primarily due to proceeds from issuances of debt that occurred in the nine months ended September 30,
2022 and did not reoccur in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

_Year Ended December 31, 2022 and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021._ Net cash provided by financing
activities was $895.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $540.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to First Lien Term Loan
borrowings of $1.3 billion in 2022 which we partially used to pay off the outstanding balances of the Delayed Draw
Term Loans and the Revolver Loans and to fund acquisitions and operational activities.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies**

Other than commitments and contingencies as disclosed in Note 12 to the unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there are no material off-balance sheet
arrangements, commitments or contingencies that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on the our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

See significant accounting policies within Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2022.

**_Litigation and Claims_**

We are subject to litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates these
legal proceedings and claims at each balance sheet date to determine the degree of probability of an unfavorable
outcome and, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. The Company expenses amounts for administering or litigating claims as incurred. See Note 12 to the
unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for information
related to litigation and claims.

**_New Accounting Pronouncements_**

See Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 for information related to accounting pronouncements that were recently adopted and those that have not yet
been adopted.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

The Company is exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Various techniques
are used to manage this risk, including, from time to time, the use of derivative instruments. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

The Company’s exposure to interest rate changes results from its variable rate debt which includes the
Company’s first lien term loans and revolving loans under its senior secured credit facilities. Based on the amount of
variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 a 10% increase in the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”) or alternative reference rate would have increased interest expense by $14.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, before impacts of hedging. The Company’s 2029 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2025
Notes are all fixed rate instruments and as such, the Company’s interest payments on those Notes are not impacted by
interest rate fluctuations.

The Company utilizes derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, to hedge the Company’s
interest rate risk to its variable rate debt obligations. The Company believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a
portion of its interest payments.

The Company entered into two pay-fixed-receive-variable interest rate swap agreements in May 2021 which
expired on March 31, 2023. To hedge interest rate risk subsequent to March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an
interest rate cap agreement in December 2022 with a notional value of $3.5 billion. The interest rate cap became
effective on March 31, 2023 and will expire on September 30, 2024. The interest rate cap limits the Company’s
exposure to increases in SOFR.

The Company performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of hypothetical movements in
interest rates on the fair value of its interest rate cap as of September 30, 2023. The sensitivity analysis, while not


-----

predictive in nature, indicated that if SOFR increased or decreased by 10%, the fair value of the interest rate cap would
increase by approximately $4.8 million or decrease by $3.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, a 10% increase of hypothetical movements in SOFR would have resulted in an increase in interest
expense by $1.9 million after impacts of the interest rate cap.

**BUSINESS**

**_Our Company_**

We are one of the largest, fastest-growing, full-service insurance brokers in the United States, offering a
broad range of property and casualty (“Property & Casualty” or “P&C”) and employee benefits (“Employee Benefits”
or “EB”) insurance products and services to middle-market businesses, public institutions and high-net worth
individuals. We have achieved significant growth in a highly fragmented and consolidating industry through a
disciplined acquisition program that targets accretive acquisitions and by focusing on generating organic growth and
profit margin expansion. In the United States, we were the eleventh largest insurance broker and the fifth largest
independent P&C insurance broker, each based on brokerage revenues generated in 2022. We have a highly
diversified revenue base with high revenue and producer retention rates. For the twelve months ended September 30,
2023, we generated total revenue of $2,462.9 million, Standalone Adjusted EBITDA of $847.9 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of $878.9 million. For definitions of Standalone Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and related
reconciliations to net income (loss), the nearest GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and footnote
(2) in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data.”

We operate our business through two segments, Retail and Accretive. Our Retail segment focuses on P&C
and employee benefits, with our P&C offerings including standard / admitted P&C commercial and personal lines
products, and specialty product niches. Accretive focuses on specialty programs, wholesale, and MGAs and was
formed from existing AssuredPartners’ businesses in 2022 to expand distribution of services, centralize expertise, and
better address specialty and emerging market risks. We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers with both
national scale and a strong local presence within its markets. Our organizational structure is comprised of our
corporate headquarters, which develops our overall growth strategy and other initiatives, identifies cross-selling
opportunities, coordinates knowledge-sharing across markets and performs general administrative oversight and
accounting, legal and information technology functions, as well as regional leadership, responsible for managing the
day-to-day operations of the offices within its region, identifying acquisition prospects, and integrating smaller tuckin acquisitions. We have all the benefits of a national brokerage network, such as economies of scale, operating
efficiencies and greater influence in carrier relationships, while retaining the deep local knowledge of our producers.
As of September 30, 2023, we operated approximately 360 offices in 40 states across the United States, the District
of Columbia, United Kingdom (“UK”), Ireland and Belgium with approximately 1,500 producers.

**_Our Products and Services_**

We offer an extensive portfolio of more than 300 products and services from more than 3,000 insurance
company partnerships to over 800,000 clients, as of September 30, 2023. No material part of our business depends
upon a single customer or on a few customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our top client
accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues, while our top ten clients represented approximately 4% of our
total revenues. We serve a variety of industries, such as real estate, construction, public entities, healthcare and senior
living, manufacturing, forestry, life sciences, hospitality, asset management, entertainment, technology, non-profit,
retail, trade and others. Our segments are:

    - _Retail: Our Retail segment focuses on P&C and EB. P&C offerings include standard / admitted P&C_
commercial and personal lines products and specialty niches. We offer a full range of commercial lines
products covering over 25 specialty niches. The segment consists of 12 industry and product verticals,
including Agribusiness, Aerospace, Education, Real Estate, Captives, Transportation, Senior Living,
Construction & Surety, Manufacturing, Government Contractor, Energy and Mergers & Acquisitions.
Personal lines offerings focus on complementary products for high net worth business owners, which
includes higher-end homes, secondary homes, valuable articles and yachts. EB provides end-to-end
consulting and administration services for fully-insured and self-insured plans, including Brokerage,
Consulting & Analytics, Communications, Employee Advocacy, and Benefits Administration. The
Retail segment accounted for 73% of revenue and drove 7.2% of organic revenue growth for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and included approximately 1,400 producers across over 300 offices.


-----

    - _Accretive: Our Accretive segment focuses on programs, wholesale, and managing general agents_
(“MGAs”). This segment was formed from existing AssuredPartners’ businesses in 2022 to expand
distribution of services, centralize expertise, and better address specialty and emerging market risks and
is composed of 26 specialty, wholesale and MGA platforms. Accretive provides a full scope of insurance
value chain intermediary capabilities and creates attractive acquisition opportunities within the highly
fragmented specialty distribution and wholesale markets. Accretive also provides the ability to design
new products and programs and place risks for increasingly complex client needs. The Accretive
segment accounted for 27% of revenue and drove 5.2% of organic revenue growth for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and included approximately 140 producers across over 60 offices. Producers
for our Retail segment may also refer or sell products for our Accretive segment as well.

The following charts illustrate the percentage of revenues generated from each product line for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023:

**_Our Competitive Strengths_**

We believe our following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us well
to profitably grow our business:

_Leading Middle-Market Broker in an Attractive Industry with Strong Fundamentals._ We are a leading
insurance broker, operating in an attractive industry with strong fundamentals. We focus on the middle-market
segment of the insurance brokerage industry, which is largely served by smaller regional and local firms who typically
focus on relationship selling and often lack the size and scale to leverage large premium relationships with insurers.
We believe our national scale and strong expertise, combined with our flexible organizational structure and strong
local relationships, will allow us to continue to expand our leadership position within the U.S. middle-market segment
of the insurance brokerage industry.

_Highly Diversified Revenue Base. Our revenue base is highly diversified across product lines, geographies,_
clients and producers, which limits our exposure to changes in industry and sector volatility, regional market
fluctuations and individual producer performance and reduces our reliance on any individual client relationship. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our top client accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues, and
our top ten clients represented approximately 4% of our total revenues. Through our revenue-generating relationships
with more than 1,800 insurance carriers, we are able to provide our clients with an expansive portfolio of products
and services at competitive prices and increase our negotiating leverage. For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, no single insurance carrier represented more than 5% of our total revenue.

_High Producer and Revenue Retention. Our average producer retention rate and revenue retention rate has_
exceeded 90% and 95%, respectively, in each of the last three years. To retain our key producers, we have developed
a compensation and incentive structure, including long-term equity-based retention and incentive programs, that aligns
our producers with our growth goals and invested in sales leadership recognition and training programs and initiatives
to educate and motivate our producers. In addition, our producers typically sign two-year customer non-solicit and
no-hire agreements, while owners of acquired businesses are required to sign non-compete agreements that run five


-----

years from the date of acquisition. We believe our low producer turnover rate, together with our strong, long-term
customer relationships, provides us with increased visibility regarding future revenues.

_Strong Free Cash Flow Generation and Low Capital Expenditure Requirements. We have consistently_
delivered strong free cash flows, driven by high Standalone Adjusted EBITDA margins, low working capital and light
capital expenditure requirements, which have averaged less than 2% of revenue over the last three years. In addition,
as a result of our many acquisitions, which are often structured as asset purchases, we also benefit from large amounts
of tax-deductible amortization expense. We believe that strong free cash flow generation affords us opportunities to
strategically invest in our business and to access debt capital, allowing us to fuel growth both organically and through
continued strategic acquisitions.

_Proven Executive Leadership Team with a Long-Term Track Record of Value Creation. Led by Jim_
Henderson, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Randy Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Vredenburg,
our President and Chief Operating Officer, our senior management team has considerable insurance brokerage
experience, with an average of 35 years of experience in the insurance brokerage industry, and is operationally
focused. Our senior management team has successfully grown our business through a series of disciplined acquisitions
and organic growth initiatives. We believe our management has the vision, experience and network of relationships
to continue our successful growth.

**_Our Business Strategies_**

We intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:

_Continue to Pursue Highly Accretive Acquisitions. We plan to continue growing our business by selectively_
entering new regional markets and expanding our product and service portfolio through sustained execution of our
disciplined and selective acquisition strategy. Our dedicated eighteen-person in-house M&A team is exclusively
focused on leveraging our senior management’s deep industry relationships to source proprietary and highly accretive
opportunities that meet our stringent criteria. This approach, combined with our brand reputation, the reputation of
our senior executives and our team-oriented and entrepreneurial environment, has allowed us to attract high-quality
insurance agencies to join our organization. We have a strong track record of completing acquisitions for which letters
of intent have been signed, with a successful completion rate of approximately 93% based on the revenues of the
companies and businesses targeted over the past three years. Since 2016 to September 30, 2023, we have successfully
executed and integrated 301 acquisitions of agencies and books of businesses, with annual combined revenues and
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, for the most recent fiscal twelvemonth period prior to the date of consummation of each acquisition. The acquisitions completed from 2016 to
September 30, 2023 had an attractive average upfront purchase price multiple of 10 times. We continue to pursue a
robust acquisition pipeline, with signed letters of intent for 15 brokerage acquisition prospects as of January 26, 2024.

_Sustained Focus on Organic Revenue Growth. Led by our Chief Revenue Officer, we continue to focus on_
organic revenue growth through producer recruitment efforts and by restructuring our compensation and performance
model to optimize our existing sales force. We have initiated regional and national sales contests to incentivize selling
efforts, developed clear company-wide benchmarks and expectations for our producers as part of an annual review
process, and instituted company-wide enhanced onboarding and training programs designed to develop talent and
promote long-term relationships with producers. We experienced 7.2% and 5.2% organic revenue growth for the
Retail and Accretive segments, respectively, with a total of 6.7% organic revenue growth, each for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we have also invested in the development of industry-specific verticals, such
as senior living, transportation, aviation, construction, architect and engineering, in order to increase retention of
existing business and facilitate growth of new business.

_Achieve Operational Efficiencies and Margin Improvements. We strive to increase margins both through_
revenue growth initiatives (through both the growth of new business as well as improvement in revenue retention) and
proactive expense management. We had approximately $2,462.9 million of total revenue for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023, which increased approximately 17.1% compared to the prior year period, and we believe that our
revenue growth initiatives will allow us to continue to grow our revenues. We have sought to improve our cost
structure by increasing standardization across our organization by using centralized information technology,
accounting centers, human resources, purchasing and real estate management. To optimize our cost structure, we have


-----

established target sales levels and operating costs across our offices and product lines. We regularly review the
efficiency metrics and margins across our company to identify underperforming offices, producers and product or
service lines. We also have a team of highly seasoned insurance agency operators who travel throughout the regions
in which we operate to assist our local and regional leaders in identifying and executing strategies to capitalize on
opportunities for operational improvements.

**_Employees_**

We had approximately 9,900 employees, including approximately 1,500 producers, as of September 30,
2023. None of our employees or producers are represented by a labor union. We believe we have excellent relations
with our employees and producers.

We generally enter into agreements that contain confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions with certain of
our employees, producers and consultants who have access to proprietary information. In addition, our producers
(other than producers in California) typically sign two-year customer non-solicit and no-hire agreements, while a
majority of owners of acquired businesses are required to sign non-compete agreements that typically run five years
from the date of acquisition.

No material part of our business depends upon a single producer or a group of producers. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, our top producer accounted for approximately 1% of our total revenues and our top ten
producers represented approximately 4% of our total revenues. The following chart illustrates the percentage of total
revenues generated by our producers for the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

**_Industry Regulation_**

Our industry is subject to regulation and legal requirements and governmental regulatory supervision in the
United States and the United Kingdom as well as in each state, province and territory we operate. Although the scope
of the regulations and requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they are generally designed to protect our
clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice. This includes the licensing of insurance agents
and brokers, establishing safeguards for protecting client information collected as part of their business and proper
handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide products and
services depends upon our compliance with rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities of each
jurisdiction in which we operate.

**_Licensing Requirements_**

The relevant insurance brokerage is required to be licensed or have received regulatory approval to conduct
business in each state in which we conduct business. In addition, most jurisdictions in which we operate require
individuals engaging in brokerage and certain insurance service activities to be licensed personally. Licensing laws
and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory
authorities, which generally have the discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals.


-----

**_Disclosure Requirements_**

Certain jurisdictions have newly implemented laws or regulations requiring enhanced disclosure of
contingent commission arrangements and other relationships that we may have with insurance carriers to clients.

**_Client Information Privacy_**

We are subject to a number of existing and changing laws in the United States aimed at protecting the privacy
of individuals from undisclosed or non-consensual sharing of sensitive information for commercial purposes,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 at the
federal level and the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the NYS Cyber Regulation
and other similar laws at the state level. There are similar privacy laws in the United Kingdom, including the Data
Protection Act 2018. These laws govern and regulate the way in which we manage, store and disseminate information
that we gather from our clients as we conduct assessments of their insurance needs. This information is shared both
internally among our employees and, where appropriate and permitted, between us and other insurance carriers and
third parties. We believe we have taken appropriate steps to safeguard our clients’ information.

**_Fiduciary Funds_**

The handling and investment of client funds we hold in a fiduciary capacity are subject to extensive regulation
and supervision. Such funds appear on our balance sheet as “Trust cash” and are maintained in accounts segregated
from our other cash and investment accounts. We believe we have taken appropriate steps to uphold our fiduciary
duties to our clients in respect of these funds.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We
establish an accrual where it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
estimated based on opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisors. Except as discussed below, we do not
believe we are a party to any claims, lawsuits or legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on our
reported results of operations.

**SECURITY OWNERSHIP**

AssuredPartners is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, Holdings in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of TopCo, and Topco in turn is a subsidiary of Parent. GTCR and certain of the Co-Investors (excluding HPS), Apax
and current and former members of AssuredPartners’ management team own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate,
approximately 48%, 25% and 27%, respectively, of Parent’s outstanding common equity interests. Parent owns all of
TopCo’s outstanding common equity interests and HPS owns all of TopCo’s outstanding preferred equity interests.
Certain members of the board of managers of Parent GP (the “GP Board”) affiliated with GTCR or Apax may be
deemed to beneficially own the equity interests owned by GTCR or Apax, as applicable. Each such individual
disclaims beneficial ownership of any such equity interests in which such individual does not have a pecuniary interest.

We presently have equity incentive arrangements in place for our directors, executives, employees and other
individual service providers. These arrangements are designed to promote our interests by providing eligible persons
with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in us or one of our affiliates as an incentive for them to remain
in our employment or service, as applicable. These arrangements may allow for the grant of profits interests or other
equity-based awards. A portion of the awards will vest based on the attainment of specified performance goals. The
equity incentive arrangements contain terms that permit, in certain instances, us or one of our affiliates to purchase
the equity of an employee or individual service provider following a termination of employment of such employee
and/or individual service provider, as the case may be.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**_Related Party Transactions_**

**_Parent Organizational Documents_**

TopCo is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Certain investment entities affiliated with the Sponsors
have entered into an amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Parent (the “LP Agreement”) and an
amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Parent GP (such agreement, the “LLC Agreement” and,
together with the LP Agreement, collectively the “Organizational Documents”), with certain current and former
members of management of the Company (the “Management Investors,” and together with the Sponsors, collectively,
the “Investors”).

The Organizational Documents contain agreements among the Investors with respect to the election of
officers and managers, rights and restrictions relating to the issuance or transfer of partnership units in Parent and
Membership interests in Parent GP (collectively, “equity interests”), including tag-along rights and drag-along rights,
rights to effect an initial public offering, information rights and other corporate governance provisions. The
Organizational Documents, subject to certain exceptions, impose restrictions on the transfer of equity interests,
including that (other than pursuant to the exercise of tag-along or drag-along rights or in connection with an initial
public offering as described below and transfers to affiliates and certain other counterparties) neither Sponsor may
transfer its membership interests in Parent to a third-party until the fifth anniversary of the consummation of the
Merger (subject to certain conditions and exceptions). The Sponsors, acting together at any time or acting separately
at any time after the fifth anniversary of the Merger, have drag along rights to require the other Investors to participate
in a proposed sale of equity interests in Parent to a third-party that would result in a change of control transaction and
the right to cause TopCo or one of its subsidiaries to effect an initial public offering with the cooperation of the other
Investors. Subject to certain exceptions, the Investors have pro rata preemptive rights with respect to certain equity
and debt issuances by Parent.

The GP Board is composed of 12 individuals, three of whom were designated by GTCR, three of whom were
designated by Apax, one of whom is the chief executive officer of TopCo, three of whom are additional members of
the executive or senior management of TopCo, as determined by a majority of the common equity of Parent held by
members of management, and two of whom are independent managers. The two independent managers were
designated by the GP Board. If a Sponsor’s ownership of common equity of Parent falls below certain ownership
thresholds, then the number of managers such Sponsor is entitled to designate to the GP Board will be reduced. In
any event, the Chief Executive Officer of TopCo will continue to have the right to be designated as a manager for so
long as he or she, as the case may be, serves in his or her capacity as the Chief Executive Officer of TopCo. Subject
to certain rights and conditions, the prior consent of both Sponsors will be required to approve certain corporate and
operational matters.

The Management Investors together currently hold approximately 27% of the outstanding equity interests in
Parent, and GTCR, Apax and the Co-Investors currently hold, directly or indirectly, the remaining outstanding equity
interests in Parent.

**_Preferred Equity_**

In connection with the Merger, TopCo issued and sold 160,000 shares of preferred equity to HPS (the “Series
A Preferred Stock”). The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to other shares of TopCo’s capital stock with respect
to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the affairs of TopCo. The Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate initial liquidation preference of
$160.0 million, or $1,000.00 per share. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a dividend that, unless
paid in cash, accrues daily and compounds quarterly on the initial liquidation preference plus all accrued, accumulated
and unpaid dividends thereon. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are only payable if and when declared by
the board of directors of TopCo, and to the extent such dividends are not declared and paid, such dividends accrete to
the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock.


-----

Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock do not have any voting or consent rights except with respect to
amendments, waivers or changes to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock or, to the extent material and adverse to
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in their capacities as such, to the charter or bylaws of Topco.

The Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity, but TopCo will be required to repurchase the Series A Preferred
Stock upon the occurrence of certain events.

**_Indemnification of Directors and Officers_**

Each of our present and former directors and officers is a party to an indemnification agreement pursuant to
which we agree to indemnify such director or officer to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against claims
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the person is or was one of our or our subsidiaries’ officers or directors.

**_Transactions with Employees and Directors_**

Certain members of our senior management are party to employment agreements with us. We have adopted
equity incentive plans. From time to time, we may also adopt other cash and equity incentive-based arrangements to
compensate our management and other employees.

**_Sales to and Purchases from Portfolio Companies of Funds Affiliated with the Sponsors_**

From time to time, we make sales to and purchases from portfolio companies of funds that are affiliated with
GTCR or Apax, but these sales are not material and are done on an arms-length basis.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings of senior secured term loans (including delayed draw term loans) and the revolving credit facility
under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either
(1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (b) the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for
an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs plus 1.00%; provided that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the base rate shall not be less than zero; or (2) a SOFR rate determined by reference to the
secured overnight financing rate for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted
for certain additional costs; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the SOFR rate shall not be less
than zero (or 50 basis points with respect to 2021 Term Loans, 2022 Term Loans, 2023 Loans and Revolving Credit
Loans, in each case, as defined therein). The applicable margin for borrowings of senior secured term loans (including
delayed draw term loans but excluding 2023 Term Loans) and the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement
are 3.50% with respect to SOFR borrowings and 2.50% with respect to base-rate borrowings or, with respect to 2023
Term Loans, 3.75% with respect to SOFR borrowings and 2.75% with respect to base-rate borrowings.

Interest on borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities is payable (1) on the last day of any interest

months with respect to SOFR borrowings with an interest period of greater than three months or (3) on the last business
day of each March, June, September and December with respect to base rate borrowings. In addition, we are required
to pay a commitment fee on any unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility. The initial commitment
fee rate is 0.50% per annum and varies based upon a leverage-based pricing grid. We are also required to pay
customary letter of credit fees.

**_Prepayments_**

The senior secured credit facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions,
with:

    - 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if we attain certain leverage ratios) of our annual
excess cash flow;

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by
the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation proceeds, subject to
de minimis thresholds), (1) if we do not reinvest those net cash proceeds in assets to be used in our
business or to make certain other permitted investments, within 450 days of the receipt of such net cash
proceeds or (2) if we commit to reinvest such net cash proceeds within 450 days of the receipt thereof,
within the later of (1) 450 days of the receipt thereof or (2) 180 days of the date of the commitment; and

    - 100% of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the borrower or any of its restricted
subsidiaries other than debt permitted under the senior secured credit facilities.

For the combined twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we were not required to make any mandatory
prepayments.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the term loan facility without premium or penalty (other
than any call protection), other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR loans. We may voluntarily
repay outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty.

**_Amortization_**

quarterly installments in aggregate amounts equal to 0.25% of the funded total principal amount per quarter, with the

are secured by substantially all of the following assets of the borrower and each guarantor, subject to certain
exceptions, including:

    - a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the borrower and 100% of the equity interests directly held by
the borrower and each guarantor in any wholly owned material subsidiary of the borrower or any
guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include
more than 65% of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and

    - a security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the borrower

The senior secured credit facilities also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default
(including change of control). The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions
(including the ability of the borrower to pay certain dividends) may also be subject to compliance with certain leverage
ratios. In addition, the revolving credit facility includes a springing financial covenant that requires compliance with
a first lien senior secured leverage ratio. The financial covenant will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter
when the aggregate amount of swing line loans, letters of credit (other than (i) those cash collateralized in an amount
equal to the outstanding amount thereof and (ii) other letters of credit in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed
$2 million) and/or revolving credit loans outstanding exceed 35% of the revolving credit commitments on the last day

covenant in the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2023.

**_Amendments to the Credit Agreement Subsequent September 30, 2023 and the Proposed Credit Agreement_**
**_Amendment_**

On October 6, 2023, we entered into that certain Nineteenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment
Agreement (the “2023 Incremental Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we incurred $400
million of incremental term loans under our term loan facility. The proceeds from such incremental borrowing were
used to finance certain acquisitions, for other general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the foregoing.

In connection with the Transactions, we expect to amend our Credit Agreement to (i) obtain $500.0 million
of incremental term loans that will mature on the date that is seven years after the closing date thereof (such
incremental term loans, the “Term B-5 Loans”), (ii) extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to August,
2028 (the “Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date”); provided that if, as of November 14, 2026 (the “Springing
Maturity Date”), more than $500.0 million of the term loan facilities (other than the Term B-5 Loans) remain
outstanding and have not been extended to a date on or after the Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date, the
Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date shall instead be the Springing Maturity Date and (iii) increase the
aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility from $414.5 million to $600.0 million. The proceeds from
the Term B-5 Loans will be utilized to repay certain of our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility
and pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, with the remainder to be used for general corporate
purposes, including to finance acquisitions. See “Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Recent Developments”
and “Use of Proceeds.” There can be no assurance that the Credit Agreement Amendment will occur on the terms
described herein or at all. The effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment is not a condition to the issuance of
the notes offered hereby.

to read each of these documents because they, not this description, define your rights as Holders. You may request
copies of the Notes and the Indenture at our address set forth under the heading “Summary.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes will be general, senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will:

    - rank senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing
and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Senior Credit Facility Obligations and the
Obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Notes and the Existing Notes Indentures;

    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer, including the
Senior Credit Facility Obligations, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;
and

    - be initially guaranteed on a joint and several and senior unsecured basis by each Restricted Subsidiary
of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities, and, in the future, all Wholly-Owned Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries and that will guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities, the
Existing Notes and certain other specified debt as described below under “—Certain Covenants—
Additional Note Guarantees”; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of Subsidiaries
of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a
Guarantor.

**Note Guarantees**

Each of the Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally fully and
unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture,


-----

whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise,
on the terms set forth in the Indenture.

Each Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the
payment of any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities or certain capital markets debt securities of the Issuer
or any other Guarantor, will, subject to certain exceptions, guarantee the Notes. On the Issue Date, each of
AssuredPartners’ Subsidiaries existing as of the Issue Date, other than Foreign Subsidiaries, immaterial subsidiaries
and a Captive Insurance Subsidiary, will guarantee the Notes. The Note Guarantees may be released under certain
circumstances as described under “—Release of Note Guarantees.”

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - be senior unsecured obligations of such Guarantor;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing
and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including its guarantee of the Senior Credit Facility
Obligations and its guarantee of the Obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Notes and the Existing
Notes Indentures;

    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including
its guarantee of the Senior Credit Facility Obligations, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of its Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the nonguarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute
any of their assets to the Issuer. On an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the nonguarantor Subsidiaries would have accounted for an immaterial portion of the Issuer’s consolidated total revenues and
consolidated income from operations, in each case, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and would have
accounted for an immaterial portion of the Issuer’s consolidated total assets and total liabilities, in each case, as of
September 30, 2023.

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—Our substantial leverage and significant debt
service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate
our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We and our subsidiaries may still
be able to incur substantial additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face”
and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—The notes will be structurally subordinated to
all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not and do not become guarantors of the notes.”

Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time
of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are limited to the amount
that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Note Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this
limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance.
If a Note Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including


-----

guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—The note guarantees may not be enforceable because of fraudulent
conveyance laws and, as a result, you may be required to return payments received by you in respect of the note
guarantees.”

**_Release of Note Guarantees_**

Each Note Guarantee by a Guarantor shall provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and
such Note Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) upon any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition (by merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any
sale, exchange or transfer), after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or
substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or
other disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) (i) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor with respect to the Senior
Credit Facilities, (ii) the release or discharge of such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Note
Guarantee or (iii) if, at the time of such release and discharge and assuming such Guarantor were not then a
Guarantor under the Indenture, such Guarantor would not have been required to guarantee the Notes pursuant
to the provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees,” except, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee after the
occurrence of a payment default or acceleration thereunder (it being understood that a release subject to a
contingent reinstatement is still a release);

(c) upon the designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) upon the Issuer exercising the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture being
discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(e) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division of such Guarantor with and
into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation, consolidation
winding up or Division, or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor;

(f) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; or

(g) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that, (i) such Note Guarantee shall
not be released pursuant to this clause (g) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any
Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) in the case of a Covenant Suspension Event, such
Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the Senior Credit Facility
Obligations and the Obligations of the Issuer or such Guarantor under the Existing Notes Indentures, the Existing
Notes and the guarantees thereof, as applicable. The Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Note
Guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing
and future Secured Indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facility Obligations, to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such Indebtedness. The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a particular
Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.


-----

A significant portion of the operations of AssuredPartners is conducted through AssuredPartners’ respective
Subsidiaries. Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes, and as described under “Note
Guarantees,” Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. In addition, some or all of the Issuer’s
future Subsidiaries may not be required to guarantee the Notes. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor or the Issuer,
claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims
of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, even if such claims do not constitute
Senior Indebtedness. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not
Guarantors, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer
and the Guarantors would have had:

    - $5,103.4 million of Secured Indebtedness under our term loan facility, including the Senior Credit
Facility Obligations, with $599.8 million of unused revolving availability under the Senior Credit
Facilities (after giving effect to $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding); and

    - $1,525.0 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes and the Notes).

As of September 30, 2023, on an as further adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the nonguarantor Subsidiaries had an immaterial amount of liabilities.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness or Disqualified
Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, as the case may be, and the issuance of
Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions and
qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or
issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured
Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We and our
subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and
our subsidiaries face.” Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes will
be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar will maintain
a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate
transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the
Notes shall be made without any deduction or withholding for any taxes, unless the obligation to deduct or withhold
is required by applicable law. If any such deduction or withholding is required by applicable law, payments by or on
account of any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Notes shall be made net of such deduction
or withholding.

The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions set forth in
the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Notice to Investors.” The registrar and the Trustee may require a
Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders
will be required to pay all taxes and fees required by law and due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender offer. Also, the
Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be
redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue the Notes initially with an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000. The Notes will
mature on          , 2032.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuer may
issue additional Notes from time to time under the Indenture (“Additional Notes”). The Notes offered hereby and any
Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that if any Additional Notes
are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will have a separate
CUSIP number and ISIN from the Notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes
of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually
issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of     % per annum and will be payable in cash semi-annually
in arrears on           and           of each year, commencing on          , 2024, to the Holders of record
as of the close of business (if applicable) on the immediately preceding           and           (whether or not
a Business Day). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly
provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the
Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the paying
agent maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” or, at the option
of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth
in the register of Holders or by wire transfer; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest
with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its
nominee will be made in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the
Issuer’s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment date,
the maturity date or any earlier required repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a Legal Holiday, the
required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest on such payment will accrue in
respect of the delay.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. In addition, other than as required under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the Issuer will not be required to offer to repurchase or redeem
or otherwise modify the terms of any of the Notes upon a change in control of, or other events involving, the Issuer or


-----

any of its Subsidiaries which may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Notes. The Issuer and its Affiliates may
at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the circumstances set forth in the tenth paragraph under “—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior
to          , 2027.

At any time prior to          , 2027, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem
all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any
applicable date of redemption, the “Redemption Date”), subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption
Date.

On and after          , 2027, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelvemonth period beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2027 ................................................................................. %
2028 ................................................................................. %
2029 and thereafter .......................................................... 100.00%

In addition, prior to          , 2027, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice as described under the
heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture at a
redemption price (as calculated by the Issuer) equal to (i) % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, with an amount
equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds are
received by or contributed to the Issuer, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date; provided that (a)
at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date
(but excluding any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date) remains outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed or to be
repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) and (b) each such redemption occurs within
180 days of the date of closing of such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (including an Asset Sale
Offer or Advance Offer), if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party approved in
writing by the Issuer making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under “—Repurchase
at the Option of Holders— Selection and Notice”), given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to
redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third-party) all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be less
than par) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date or purchase date,
subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant


-----

interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date. In determining whether the Holders
of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn Notes in a tender offer (including an Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer), Notes owned by an Affiliate of
the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed
to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

The Trustee or the applicable depositary shall select the Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice.”

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date with respect to the Notes,
unless, prior to or concurrently with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer or a
third-party has mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission, a redemption notice with respect
to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” or makes
an Alternate Offer, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below
(the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Issuer may determine (such offer at a higher amount, an
“Alternate Offer”)) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right
of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below). Within 30 days following any
Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the
Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change
of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 Business Days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided, that the
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in the Issuer’s discretion, until such time (including more
than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below
shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted
for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse
of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent
specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business
Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent for such
later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion (such time and date, the “withdrawal
_deadline”), Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer_
to purchase such Notes; _provided_ that the paying agent receives, not later than withdrawal deadline, an
electronic transmission (in PDF), facsimile transmission or letter or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered


-----

for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such
Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued
new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered, which unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess of $2,000;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other conditions specified
therein and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the
notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase
may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or
all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by
the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(9) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must
follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities
of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.
The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which Holdings or the Issuer (or any of their Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain
change of control events with respect to Holdings or the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a
Change of Control under the Existing Notes Indentures or the Indenture). If Holdings or the Issuer experiences a
change of control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a
requirement to offer to repurchase the Indebtedness governed by such agreement, including the Existing Notes
Indentures, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the
Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior
Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements, including the Existing Notes Indentures, or repurchase such
Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other
agreements being declared due and payable.


-----

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Indebtedness—We may not
be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control
purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to
engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide
to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital
structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness
are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Such restrictions in the Indenture with respect to the Notes can
be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any
covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third-party approved in writing by the
Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner,
at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such
Change of Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but the Change of
Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). In addition, the Issuer or any third party
approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to
pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the
Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party approved in writing by the
Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to
the Redemption Date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described under
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice”), given not more than 30 days following such
purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase
(with respect to a third-party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second
_Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second_
Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the
right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the
Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to
be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, as applicable.


-----

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than any Permitted Holder. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer with
respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture, selection of the
Notes for redemption or purchase will be made on a pro rata basis to the extent applicable or by lot or by such method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that if the Notes are represented by global notes, interests in
the Notes shall be selected for redemption or purchase by DTC in accordance with its standard procedures therefor;
_provided, further, that no Notes of less than $2,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part._

Other than as set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph, notices of redemption or offers to purchase
shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days and not more than 60
days before the Redemption Date or purchase date to each Holder at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that notices of redemption may be delivered or mailed more than 60
days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes, a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the next paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part
only, any notice of redemption or offer to purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal
amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed or purchased.

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given in
connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a
Change of Control and prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may,
at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or
occurrence of the related Equity Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or
purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition,
and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or purchase date may be delayed until such
time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered,
including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied or waived by the redemption or purchase date or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or
such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if the Issuer reasonably believes that any
or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer
that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single
notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such
notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, if any Notes are to be redeemed or purchased in part
only, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the
original Note in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note; provided that the new Notes
will be only issued in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase, unless
such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the redemption or


-----

purchase date, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption or purchase, unless
the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption or purchase price or such redemption or purchase remains conditioned
on the occurrence of a future event that has not occurred.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of
such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such
Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration (measured at the
time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales
since May 13, 2019 (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

Within 450 days after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds from
any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option,
may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(a) to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes or the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) Obligations related to
Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and/or (iii) Obligations under any
other Secured Indebtedness, and in each case, in the case of revolving obligations (other than obligations in
respect of any asset-based credit facility to the extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of in connection
with such Asset Sale constituted “borrowing base assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto;

(b) to repay Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior Indebtedness referred
to in clause (a) above), and in the case of revolving obligations (other than obligations in respect of any assetbased credit facility to the extent the assets sold or otherwise disposed of in connection with such Asset Sale
constituted “borrowing base assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided
that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount of
Obligations under the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this
clause (b) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or
(y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices
(which may be below par) and/or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Sale Offer and for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, thereon) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any
Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (b) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale Offer
for purposes hereof);

(c) to invest in the business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, including (i) any investment in Additional
Assets, (ii) making capital expenditures and (iii) any investment in any property or other assets that replace
the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale;

(d) to repay Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;


-----

_provided that, in the case of clause (c) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net
Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset
Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner within the later of 450 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days of the Acceptable
Commitment (the period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the “First Commitment Application
_Period”), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net_
Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the First
Commitment Application Period (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner
prior to 180 days from the date of entering into the Second Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied or if such Second
Commitment is not entered into prior to the expiration of the First Commitment Application Period, then such Net
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired.

To the extent Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as provided and
within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds.” No later than 20 Business Days after the date that the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $40.0_
million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of other Indebtedness that is pari
_passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness_
(an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, in the case of the Notes only, equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes only, in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will
commence an Asset Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to
the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by
making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”) with respect
to all or part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”).

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable,
Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of
an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may include any remaining Excess
Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) as Declined Proceeds, and use such Declined
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as
applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the applicable paying agent, upon
determination by the Issuer of the aggregate principal amount to be selected, shall select the Notes (subject to
applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness
shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or
principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no
Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination; provided,
that no Notes of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such
completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations
of Excess Proceeds.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect
to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer
or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of
such Net Proceeds may apply any Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving
credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not


-----

prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in
Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such
investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Sale, execution of a
definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale and consummation of the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount
so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant with respect to
such Asset Sale.

For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant (and no other provision), the following shall
be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:

(1) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most
recent balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred,
accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been
reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto if such
incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in
good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their
terms subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets
(or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a
written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;

(2) the amount of any trade-in value applied to the purchase price of any replacement assets acquired
in connection with such Asset Sale;

(3) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or
Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of
the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset
Sale; and

(4) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (with the fair market value of such item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken
together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (3) that is at that
time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $500.0 million and (y) 5.0% of Total Assets at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the asset sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions
of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Credit Facilities limit, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from
purchasing any Notes pursuant to this asset sale covenant. In the event the Issuer is contractually prohibited from
purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent of its lenders or
holders of such Indebtedness with respect to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition or limitation. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain


-----

such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes when required by the terms and provisions of this asset sale
covenant would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture. If on any date following
the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of three Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default
has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), then beginning on such date and continuing
until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the
following covenants (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock;”

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(7) “—Additional Note Guarantees.”

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
the rating assigned to the Notes by two of three of the Rating Agencies is below an Investment Grade Rating, then the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture
with respect to future events.

The period of time between (and including) the date of the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion
Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note
Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended and/or released to the extent applicable under clause (f) of the
paragraph under “—Note Guarantees—Release of Note Guarantees” during the Suspension Period. Additionally,
upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be
reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture
with respect to the Notes; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date,
the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period), (2)
all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed
incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during
the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph
of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no
Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, unless such designation
would have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such
covenant was in effect for the purposes of designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Issue Date to the date of


-----

such designation, (4) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement
entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3)
of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted
pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries,” (6) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under
“—Additional Note Guarantees” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee entered into by such
Subsidiary during the Suspension Period, (7) all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period (or
deemed created, incurred or assumed in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period) in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed to have been outstanding
on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and
(8) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made
under clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
permitted under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant
and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted
as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely
for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated on or after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees or the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at
any time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as
a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of
the Suspension Period or after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension
Period), and (2) on or following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without
causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or
obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Trustee will have no duty to monitor, inquire as to or ascertain compliance with the covenants described
below, or provide notice to the holders of Notes of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any
merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity Interests
(other than Disqualified Stock); or

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a
Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend,
payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;


-----

(II) redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests
of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, in each
case, held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, purchase, repurchase, defease, discharge or otherwise
acquire or retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any
Subordinated Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clauses (7), (8) or (9) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock;” or

(b) the prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or other acquisition or
retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal
installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of prepayment, redemption,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or acquisition or retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through
(IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the
time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and, in the case of a Restricted
Investment utilizing clause (3)(f) of this paragraph, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6)
of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be continuing or would
occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) except in the case of a Restricted Investment, immediately after giving effect to such transaction
on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made
by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after August 2, 2017 (including Restricted Payments permitted
by clauses (1), (6)(c) and (8) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments
permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer (including any predecessor of the Issuer) for
the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning on January 1, 2016 to the end of the Issuer’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such
Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus
100% of such deficit (which amount in this clause (a) may not be less than zero); plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or
other property received (other than Equity Interests received in connection with the Acquisition) by the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries since immediately after August 2, 2017 (other than (x) any
Restricted Payments received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with the
Acquisition, (y) net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur
Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” or, after August 2, 2017 and prior to the Issue Date, Section 10.11(b)(12)(a) of each of
the Existing Notes Indentures and (z) net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been
used for making a Restricted Payment pursuant to the Existing Notes Indentures after August 2, 2017
and prior to the Issue Date) from the issue or sale of:


-----

(i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined
below), but excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or other
property received from the sale of:

(x) Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests received in connection with
the Acquisition) to any future, current or former employee, director, manager or
consultant of the Issuer, its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entity after August 2, 2017
to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in
accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph or, after August 2,
2017 and prior to the Issue Date, Section 10.10(b)(4) of each of the Existing
Notes Indentures; and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) Equity Interests of Parent Entities, to the extent such net cash proceeds

-----

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted_
Investment) permitted under clause (16), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur
as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
or Permitted Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted
Payments described in the preceding clauses (1) through (21) above and/or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,”
the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or from time to time later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in
part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment (or a portion thereof) among such clauses
(1) through (21) and/or such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the Transaction Test
Date, in the case of a Specified Transaction, or the date of the Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed
to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted
Payment.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not
permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence of
the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary so designated
will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the
definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment
in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of
“Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment”
with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise
(collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to issue
Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and
issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness), and issue shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period would have been equal to or less than 7.00 to
1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom),

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (32) of the preceding paragraph or is entitled to be incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may divide, classify or from
time to time reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
(or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include
the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) in one
of the above clauses or under the first paragraph; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior
Credit Facilities on the Issue Date will be treated as incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the
preceding paragraph and not reclassified;

(2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant;

(3) the principal amount of Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock outstanding under any clause of this covenant shall be determined after giving effect to the
application of proceeds of any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock to refinance any
such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; and

(4) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement
Period at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA of


-----

the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period restriction or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the
Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period restriction, as applicable, to be exceeded if calculated based
on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period or the
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period, as applicable, on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period restriction or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period restriction, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance
costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or
similar fees) in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for
purposes of this covenant. Any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (12)(b) of the second
paragraph of this covenant shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees)
incurred in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or
liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock was deemed to be incurred (or, in the case of revolving credit debt, first committed) for purposes of this
covenant; _provided_ that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation
preference of such Disqualified Stock or such Preferred Stock being refinanced plus the aggregate amount of accrued
but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees,
costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) incurred in connection with such
refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on
the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness
solely because such Indebtedness has a junior priority with respect to shared collateral or because it is guaranteed by
other obligors.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or assume any
Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness on any asset
or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, unless the Notes (or the related Note Guarantee in the case of Liens on
assets or property of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or, at the Issuer’s option or if such Subject
Lien secures Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior basis to) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien.


-----

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by its terms
that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In addition, in the event that a Subject Lien is or
becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and
discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Subject
Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Issuer will not merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division
as the Dividing Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(a) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, winding up or Division (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be,

the Issuer is not a corporation, a co-issuer of the Notes is a corporation;

and

(e) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, winding up, Division, sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and such supplemental indentures or other documents
or instruments, if any, comply with the Indenture.


-----

The Successor Company will succeed to and be substituted for the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes,
and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (c) and (d),

(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and

(b) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into an Affiliate of the
Issuer or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer
in the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia.

Subject to the provisions described in the Indenture governing release of a Note Guarantee, no Guarantor
will, and the Issuer will not permit a Guarantor to, merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into,
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person (whether or not the Issuer or a Guarantor is the surviving Person), or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or
more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, winding up or Division (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof
or the District of Columbia (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Guarantor”); and

(b) the Successor Guarantor, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of
such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s related Note Guarantee pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee; or

(2) the transaction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales.”

The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and
such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and such Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its
obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor

or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties or assets to another Guarantor
or the Issuer, (ii) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of
reincorporating or reorganizing such Guarantor in the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of

entity organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or a jurisdiction in the
United States; (iv) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose all or substantially all of its assets
comprising Equity Interests of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to the Issuer or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries
or (v) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Board or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent
Entity of the Issuer) determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer and is not materially
disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case, without regard to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or
for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate


-----

payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $47.5 million and (y) 5% of Consolidated EBITDA of the
Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis or,
if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare
such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such transaction is taken in its entirety; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related
Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $95.0
million and (y) 10% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period, a

Restricted Subsidiaries or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such

_provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash_

amalgamation is otherwise consummated in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a
_bona fide business purpose;_

indemnities and related expenses (plus any unpaid management, consulting, monitoring, transaction,
advisory and other fees, indemnities and expenses accrued in any prior year) and any termination fees
(including any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event,
including an initial public offering) to the Investors pursuant to the Organizational Documents (or any
amendment thereto or replacement thereof so long as any such amendment or replacement is not materially
disadvantageous, in the good faith judgment of the Board of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer),
to the Holders when taken as a whole, as compared to the Organizational Documents as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment or replacement) and (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar amounts
to the Investors and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors, in each case, approved by, or pursuant to

or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less
favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would
have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated
Person on an arm’s length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect or contemplated in the good faith determination of the
Issuer as of the Issue Date (other than any agreement or arrangement of the type described in clause (3)
above), or any amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not materially disadvantageous in the
good faith judgment of the Board or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer)
to the Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date);

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of, the Acquisition Agreement, any stockholders agreement or the equivalent
(including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent
Entity) is a party as of the Issue Date or entered into in connection with the Acquisition and any similar
agreements which it (or any Parent Entity) may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence
of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or such Parent Entity) of obligations
under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into
after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such
amendment or new agreement are not otherwise materially disadvantageous in the good faith judgment of
the Board or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer) to the Holders when
taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date or entered into in
connection with the Acquisition;

All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to
which they relate, and all such quarterly information shall be furnished within 45 days after the end of the first three

separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

The Issuer will make available such information and such reports (as well as the details regarding the
conference call described below) to the Trustee under the Indenture, to any Holder of the Notes and, upon request, to
any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on its website, on Intralinks or any
comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will
make such information readily available to any Holder of the Notes, any bona fide prospective investor in the Notes,
any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes,
in each case, who agrees to treat such information as confidential or accesses such information on Intralinks or any
comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment; provided


-----

that the Issuer shall post such information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information
to any such Holder of the Notes, bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, further,
that the Issuer may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information otherwise to be provided pursuant to this
paragraph to any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of such
information to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further,
that such Holders, bona fide prospective investors, security analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such
reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the
information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii)
not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein).

obligated to so furnish), summary condensed consolidated annual or quarterly income statement and
balance sheet, as applicable, without notes thereto, and a summary discussion of the results of operations
for the relevant reporting period,

promptly hold a conference call to discuss such information and reports or summary information and the
results of operations for the relevant reporting period (which conference call, for the avoidance of doubt, may
be held prior to such time that the annual or quarterly information and reports required by the first paragraph
of this “Reports and Other Information” covenant are furnished to Holders); and

(2) announce by press release to the appropriate nationally recognized wire services or post to the
website of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by
the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) or a third-party prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in
accordance with clause (1) of this paragraph the time and date of such conference call and either including
all information necessary to access the call or informing Holders, bona fide prospective investors, market
makers and securities analysts how they can obtain such information.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to
be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable
under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the
failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under this covenant, will for the 365 days after the
occurrence of such Event of Default consist exclusively, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of the right to
receive additional interest on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate equal to 0.50% per annum. This additional
interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest payable under the Indenture.
This additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default
relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described above this covenant first occurs to, but
excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such reporting
obligations is cured or waived). If the Event of Default resulting from such failure to comply with the reporting
obligations is continuing on such 365th day, such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject
to the other remedies provided under the heading “—Events of Default and Remedies.”

Any Parent Entity may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this “Reports and Other Information”
covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent Entity instead of the Issuer;
_provided that to the extent such Parent Entity holds assets (other than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that_
exceeds the lesser of (i) 1% of the Total Assets of such Parent Entity and (ii) 1% of the total revenue for the preceding


-----

fiscal year of such Parent Entity, then such information related to such Parent Entity shall be accompanied by
consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) or on a non-public,
password-protected website maintained by the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) or a third-party, that explains in reasonable
detail the differences between the information of such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating
information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information referred to in the
first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has filed reports containing such information (or any
such information of a Parent Entity in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “Reports and
Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Domestic Subsidiaries that is a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary
(other than the Guarantors and any Receivables Subsidiary) to guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness under (i) the
Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) any Credit Facility permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation
on Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” in an aggregate principal amount in excess
of $50.0 million, (iii) the Existing Notes or (iv) any other capital markets debt securities in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $50.0 million, unless such Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Subsidiary; provided that this covenant shall not
be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer may otherwise elect to have any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
become a Guarantor, in which case such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 30 day-period
described in the immediately preceding paragraph.

Each Note Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under
“Note Guarantees.”

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following events is an “Event of Default” with respect to the Notes under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written notice given
by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a
default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; provided that in the
case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Reports and Other Information,”
such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice described in this
clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there
is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Wholly-Owned
Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Wholly-Owned


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any
Permitted Receivables Financing), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the
issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than
the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the
holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final
maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any
applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is in the aggregate equal to
the greater of (x) $142.5 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) and (y) 15% of Consolidated
EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements
of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “Reports and Other Information”) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess of the
greater of (x) $142.5 million and (y) 15% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the insurer has been notified of such
judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final non-appealable judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and nonappealable, and, in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined
as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as
required under “Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (the “bankruptcy
_provisions”); or_

(7) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Guarantors that
together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Note
Guarantee) or any such Guarantor or such group of Guarantors denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Note Guarantee (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and
discharge of the Indenture or the release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture).

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes
may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding
Notes to be due and payable immediately. However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not
constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes notify the Company of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (5), the Company does not cure such
Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a
notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than
two years prior to such notice of Default.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this
section, the principal of and interest on all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or
notice. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each


-----

Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee
may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the
Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee acceleration is
not in the best interest of the Holders. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may
be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default
or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture with respect to the Notes (except a continuing Default
or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a nonconsenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes; _provided_ such
rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled,
waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such
Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case
may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Notes or the Indenture unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer
of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

These limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such note on or after the respective due date expressed in
such Note.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each
a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the
Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed


-----

solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of
a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event
of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must,
at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the
Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position
Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the
Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be
provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time,
in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a
final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery
of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such
Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in
such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event
of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have
received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall
have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to
ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such holder) or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability.

The Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year
(beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer of
the certificate knows of any failure by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with all conditions and
covenants of the Indenture during such fiscal year. In addition, the Issuer is required, within 30 days (or 180 days, if
with respect to a Default under “—Reports and Other Information”) upon becoming aware of any Default to deliver
to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day
or 180-day time period, as applicable).

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (such other default, the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default


-----

is cured, the Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial
Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed under “—Reports and Other Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within
the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default
or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder
of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or entities (other than the Issuer in respect of the Notes
and each Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the
Guarantors under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes or the Note Guarantees,
as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of
the Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations
discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Note
Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment
and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture, the
Notes or the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply
with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events
pertaining to the Issuer) described under “Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the
Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts
(including scheduled payments thereon) as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an Independent Financial
Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or
on the Redemption Date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes
and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular Redemption
Date; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount


-----

deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be
deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue
Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income
tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to
make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case
the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture) to which
the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that
resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit
relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the
Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes when:


-----

(1) either:

(a) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) (w) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, (ii) will become due and payable
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense, of the Issuer;

(x) the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars,
U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an amount (including scheduled
payments thereon) sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and accrued
interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to
the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the
Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable
Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption.
Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; and

(y) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case may be.

(2) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of
Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee stating that all conditions
precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantee
may be amended or supplemented and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of
the Indenture, the Notes or any Note Guarantee may be waived, in each case, with the consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by
the Issuer or its Affiliates (excluding any Affiliated Debt Fund), including consents or waivers obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or waiver may
not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or reduce the premium
payable upon the redemption of such Notes or change the time at which such Notes may be redeemed as
described under “—Optional Redemption;” _provided_ that any amendment to the minimum notice


-----

requirement may be made with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Note Guarantee which
cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights
of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or any Note of any Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of the Notes that would adversely affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any Significant
Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to its Note Guarantee or the Indenture
to which it is a party, other than any amendment or supplement the sole purpose of which is to add an additional
Guarantor) and the Trustee, without the consent of any Holders, may amend the Notes, the Note Guarantee and the
Indenture for any of the following purposes:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;”

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders pursuant
to the terms of the Indenture;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in any material respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon
the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the
Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, if applicable;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee or a successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;


-----

(10) to add a Guarantor, a guarantee of a Parent Entity or a co-obligor of the Notes under the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision of this
“Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; _provided,_ _however, that such amendment does not materially and adversely_
affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to secure the Notes and/or the related Note Guarantees;

(14) to release any Guarantor from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or
required by the Indenture;

(15) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted by the Indenture (including

(16) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or
waiver.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment, waiver, modification or deletion of the provisions described
under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders— Asset
Sales” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights
of Holders of the Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to, or to receive payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, the Notes held by all Debt Fund Affiliates shall
not account for more than 49.9% of the principal amounts of outstanding Notes included in determining whether the
Holders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of
the terms of the Indenture therefrom, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to the Indenture or (C) directed or
required the Trustee to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under the Indenture;
it being understood and agreed that the portion of the Notes that accounts for more than 49.9% of the relevant requisite
principal amount of outstanding Notes shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all such purposes.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the provisions described
under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) will be deemed given on the first date on which
publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days
after mailing or transmitting, Notices sent by overnight delivery service will be deemed given when delivered and
notices given electronically will be deemed given when sent. Notice otherwise given in accordance with the

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if
it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to
continue or resign as Trustee.


-----

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising
any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event
of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the
degree of care of a prudent person under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be
under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless
such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture (including as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default or, in
the case of a Permitted Change of Control, any minimum ratings requirement), in each case in connection with (a)
any Limited Condition Acquisition, (b) any incurrence of Indebtedness (including the incurrence of Liens with
respect thereto), Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or any repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with respect to which a notice of repayment or redemption (or
similar notice), which may be conditional, has been delivered, (c) the making of any Asset Sale or any disposition
excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale,” (d) the making of an Investment or Restricted Payment or (e) any
Permitted Change of Control, (the transactions referred to in clauses (b) through (e)), collectively, the “Specified
_Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”), the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial_
metric or whether any such Specified Transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied
with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default or, in the case of a Permitted
Change of Control, compliance with any minimum ratings requirement)) may, at the option of the Issuer, any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Entity of the Issuer, any successor entity of any of the foregoing or a third-party
(the “Testing Party”) (which election may be made on or prior to the date of consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction), be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition
Acquisition or Specified Transaction are entered into, the date of declaration of a Restricted Payment, the date of the
public announcement of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, or the date such notice,
which may be conditional, of such repayment, redemption, repurchase of refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is given to the holders of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (any
such date, the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall be calculated with such
_pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the_
definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio
after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction (including any incurrence of
Liens, Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for
purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified
Transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or
otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such basket, ratio or related financial
metrics (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the
target company for the Applicable Measurement Period) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to
the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, such baskets, ratios or
financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction is permitted hereunder and (y)
such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or Specified Transaction except as contemplated in clause (a) of the immediately succeeding proviso;
_provided, however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become_
available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial
metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be
deemed to be the applicable Transaction Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics, (b) if
any ratios or financial metrics improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios,


-----

financial metrics or baskets may be utilized, (c) if the Testing Party elects to have such determinations occur at the
Transaction Test Date, any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any baskets, ratios or financial metrics under the Indenture after the Transaction Test Date and before
the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction unless and until such Limited
Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by the Testing Party, prior to the
consummation thereof and (d) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will
be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin (giving effect to any step-ups or
margin caps, but without giving effect to any increases as a result of market “flex”) contained in any financing
commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as
reasonably determined by Testing Party in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if the Testing Party has
exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the Transaction
Test Date (including any new Transaction Test Date) for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified
Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified
Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for
purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition or
Specified Transaction is permitted under the Indenture and (y) if the Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant
to the foregoing and the minimum ratings requirement in the definition of Permitted Change of Control shall not be
satisfied following the Transaction Test Date for the applicable Change of Control solely as a result of any event or
circumstance that is unrelated to the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control
has occurred at or prior to the time of the rating decline) as announced or publicly confirmed to the Trustee in
writing by either S&P or Moody’s, any such rating decline shall be deemed to not have occurred for purposes of
determining whether such Change of Control is a Permitted Change of Control under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with a Testing Party’s election to use a Transaction
Test Date in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, any reference to “date of
incurrence” or “time of incurrence” or other similar phrases with respect to the date or time an action is taken herein
will mean the Transaction Test Date.

**Certain Compliance Determinations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the succeeding two paragraphs in this section
and “Limited Condition Transactions” above, all financial ratios, tests, covenants, calculations and measurements
(including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total Assets,
Consolidated EBITDA, any Fixed Amount (as defined below) or Incurrence Based Amount (as defined below))
contained in the Indenture that are calculated with respect to any period during which any Specified Event, Specified
Transaction or Permitted Change of Control occurs shall be calculated with respect to such period and each such
Specified Event, Specified Transaction or Permitted Change of Control, as the case may be, on a pro forma basis and
may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Entity of the Issuer instead, so long as such
Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Issuer (as
determined in good faith by the Board or senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer)). Further,
if, since the beginning of any such period and on or prior to the date of any required calculation of any financial ratio,
test, covenant, calculation or measurement (i) any Specified Event, Specified Transaction or Permitted Change of
Control has occurred or (ii) any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated
or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any joint venture since the beginning of
such period has consummated any Specified Event or Specified Transaction, then, in each case, any applicable
financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement shall be calculated on a pro forma basis for such period as
if such Specified Event, Specified Transaction or Permitted Change of Control, as the case may be (including, without
duplication of any amounts otherwise reflected in Consolidated EBITDA for the applicable Test Period, any “run rate”
cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies) had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, with respect to any amounts incurred or
transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including any covenant) that
does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Consolidated Secured Debt
Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”)


-----

substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a
provision of the Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (any such
amounts, the “Incurrence Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded
in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence Based Amounts.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is
undertaken in reliance on an Incurrence-Based Amount, such Incurrence-Based Amount shall be calculated without
regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (i) immediately
prior to or in connection therewith or (ii) used to finance working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (as reasonably determined by the Issuer).

For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a
calculation of any Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or
measurement (including, without limitation, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Interest Expense, Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Total
Assets and Consolidated EBITDA), such Fixed Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant,
calculation or measurement shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to “—Limited Condition
Transactions” above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may
be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such Fixed
Amounts, Incurrence-Based Amounts or financial ratio, test, covenant, calculation or measurement occurring after the
time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case
may be. In addition, the Issuer (or a Parent Entity) and its Subsidiaries may be required to restate historical financial
statements as the result of the implementation of changes in GAAP or the interpretation thereof, and such restatements
will not result in a Default under the Indenture to the extent that the restatements do not reveal any material omission,
misstatement or other material inaccuracy in the reported information from actual results for any relevant prior period.

The Indenture shall also provide that, for purposes of determining any calculation or measure as of any
Applicable Calculation Date or date of determination (including, without limitation, Consolidated EBITDA,
Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, Permitted Receivables Financing and Total Assets) under the
Indenture, the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, to
the extent not already reflected in U.S. dollars in the relevant financial statements (which may be internal), based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the Applicable Calculation Date.

delivered to the Trustee, to treat an Elected Amount under any Indebtedness which is to be Incurred (or any
commitment in respect thereof) as being Incurred as of the Applicable Calculation Date and (i) any subsequent
Incurrence of such Indebtedness under such commitment that was so treated (so long as the total amount under such
Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an
Incurrence of additional Indebtedness at such subsequent time, (ii) such Person may revoke an election of an Elected
Amount pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers
(including the Acquisition), amalgamations, consolidations, Divisions and disposed operations (as determined in
accordance with GAAP) and operational changes (including any Producer Recruitment) that have been made by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Applicable Measurement Period or subsequent to such
Applicable Measurement Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Applicable Calculation Date shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers (including the
Acquisition), amalgamations, consolidations, Divisions, disposed operations and operational changes (including any
Producer Recruitment) (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period; provided that for
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any classification under GAAP of any Person or business in respect of which
a definitive agreement for the disposition thereof has been entered into as discontinued operations, any change in any
associated fixed charge obligations and any change in Consolidated EBITDA of such Person or business as a result of
the disposition shall be excluded pursuant to this paragraph until such disposition shall have been consummated. If
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary (including pursuant to a redesignation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary) or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, Division or disposed operation (including any spin-off transaction) and operational
changes (including any Producer Recruitment) during such period that would have required adjustment pursuant to
this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such
Applicable Measurement Period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
Division, disposed operation or operational changes (including any Producer Recruitment) had occurred at the
beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a Restricted Subsidiary
as of the Applicable Calculation Date which was previously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated
as a Restricted Subsidiary during or subsequent to the Applicable Measurement Period, the computation referred to
above shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that such redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary (and the
change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had
occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to a transaction, the _pro forma_
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include,
for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies resulting
from any Asset Sale or other disposition or such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger (including the
Acquisition), amalgamation, consolidation or Division, disposed operation, operational changes (including any
Producer Recruitment) or other transaction, in each case calculated in accordance with and permitted by clause (2) of
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” herein). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being
given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Applicable
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations
applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest
rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest
implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation
referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall
be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if lower, the
maximum commitments under such revolving credit facility as of the Applicable Calculation Date. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a

eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen,
or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

effect from time to time; provided that (a) all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be
construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made without giving effect

thereto (including pursuant to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein, (b) the accounting for operating leases and financing or capital
leases under U.S. GAAP as in effect on January 1, 2013 (including, without limitation, FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 840—Leases) shall apply for the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of the
Indenture, including the definition of Financing Lease Obligation, (c) in determining any amounts or ratios under the
Indenture and with respect to any reports provided by the Company to Holders of the Notes, the accounting for revenue
recognition under U.S. GAAP may, at the Company’s option, be made under ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable
_Revenue Arrangements (Topic 605), notwithstanding any adoption by the Company of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from_
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) for purposes of its consolidated financial statements, (d) any calculation or
determination in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP across multiple quarters need not be calculated
or determined using the same accounting standard for each constituent quarter and (e) neither IFRS nor U.S. GAAP
shall include the policies, rules and regulations of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the International Accounting Standards Board or any other applicable regulatory or governing body applicable only
to public companies (unless the Issuer or a Parent Entity is a Public Company). At any time after the Issue Date, the
Issuer may elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein
to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided that
any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, any calculation or determination in the Indenture
that requires the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to
apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Issuer shall give
notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely
making an election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of
Indebtedness.

For avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any classification under GAAP of any Person or business in respect
of which a definitive agreement for the disposition thereof has been entered into as discontinued operations, the
Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated EBITDA of such Person or business shall not be excluded from the
calculation of Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA, respectively, until such disposition shall have been
consummated.

If there occurs or has occurred a change in generally accepted accounting principles and such change would
cause a change in the method of calculation of any term or measure used in the Indenture (an “Accounting Change”),
then the Issuer may elect, as evidenced by a written notice of the Issuer to the Trustee, that such term or measure shall
be calculated as if such Accounting Change had not occurred.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited with a custodian for DTC
and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Reg S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Reg S Global Notes will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee
of DTC, and deposited with a custodian for DTC, for credit to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in the Reg S Global
Notes (the “Reg S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry
Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, or persons that hold interests through such
participants. DTC holds interest in the Global Notes on behalf of its participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes are not entitled to receive physical
delivery of certificated notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form.
The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while
the notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests are not considered the owners or “holders” of notes for
any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominees) will be considered the sole holders of
such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing such notes. In addition, participants in DTC must
rely on the procedures of DTC and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the
indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the applicable Trustee has any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC (or its nominees) will redeem an
equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such BookEntry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the redemption of such Global Note
(or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of the notes,
are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit its participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments
to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as it deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no BookEntry Interest of $2,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest and all other amounts payable) to DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such
payments to the applicable participants in accordance with its procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or


-----

governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law. The Issuer expects that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through such participants.

Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the applicable Trustee will treat the registered holders of the
Global Notes (e.g., DTC (or its nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the applicable Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of DTC or any participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, or
any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;
or

    - DTC or any participant or indirect participant. Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.

**_Currency of Payment for the Global Notes_**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between DTC and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global Notes will be paid to the applicable holders of
interests in such notes (the “DTC Holders”) through DTC in U.S. dollars.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the applicable Trustee, the initial purchasers or
any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions,
costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection
with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including
the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global
Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes
for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) and to distribute Definitive
Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
DTC and its direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time. The Global
Notes bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the date the notes were originally
issued (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), any sale or transfer of ownership of a Reg S Book-Entry Interest in
the notes to a U.S. person shall not be permitted unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A or
Regulation S. Subject to the foregoing, a Reg S Book-Entry Interest in the notes may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of a Restricted Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor
of a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the


-----

requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to
Investors,” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction.

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests in the notes to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book-Entry Interests in the notes will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend
appearing on the face of the applicable 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Notice to Investors.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests in the notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Reg S Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S and that, if
such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held
immediately thereafter through DTC. See “Notice to Investors.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such
other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

    - if DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note, or
DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a qualified
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days of such notice; or

    - if an event of default under the indenture occurred or is continuing and the owner of a Book-Entry
Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such note by surrendering it to the registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note
shall be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed shall be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $2,000 shall be issued. The Issuer will bear
the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer shall not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (a) the record date for any payment of interest on the applicable notes, (b) any
date fixed for redemption of the applicable notes or (c) the date fixed for selection of the applicable notes to be
redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any notes selected for
redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the transfer agent may require a holder,
among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the indenture. The
Issuer may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the indenture and the applicable
notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the registrar for the notes or at the office of a transfer agent for such notes, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee for
the notes shall authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if such Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements
are met. The Trustee for the applicable notes or the Issuer may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both such Trustee and the Issuer to protect
the Issuer, such Trustee or the paying agent for the notes appointed pursuant to the indenture from any loss which any


-----

of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for its expenses in replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note for
the notes only in accordance with the indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable
transfer agent a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of
convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC and are subject to changes by
DTC. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact DTC or its
participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

    - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities
participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are
the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system
and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for that interest. The ownership interests in, and the transfers of ownership interests in, each note
held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. The laws of
some states require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through DTC participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System and any permitted secondary
market trading activity in the notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds.
The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.


-----

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross-market transfers of BookEntry Interests in the notes between the participants in DTC will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s
rules.

Although DTC is expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in
the Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such
procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Issuer, the applicable Trustee, the
initial purchasers, the registrar, any transfer agent or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance
by DTC or its participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC accounts
will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, holders on the business day following the settlement date
against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and will settle in same day funds. Since the
purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests
where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired
value date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations.
This summary deals only with notes held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment) by persons who purchase
the notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their initial offering price.

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States federal income
tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation that is created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

    - a trust, if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and one or more United
States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election
in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States federal income
tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds
the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the
notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
applicable to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it discuss
considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws, including, without limitation:

    - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt entity;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or
a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;


-----

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (including S
corporations) or an investor in such an entity;

    - a U.S. holder that holds notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary;

    - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a “controlled foreign corporation”;

    - a “passive foreign investment company”;

    - a person that holds Existing 2025 Notes;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial
decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United
States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any
rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take
positions concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of
the notes that are different from those discussed below or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in
the event of litigation.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
to you in light of your particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not address the effects of any United
States federal tax consequences other than income taxes (such as estate and gift taxes and the Medicare tax on certain
investment income), and does not address state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be
construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the**
**particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of**
**the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of**
**any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Certain Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S.
holders of the notes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on the notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time the interest is paid
or accrued in accordance with your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize
taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market
value of any property received (less any amount equal to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed in the
manner described above under “—Stated Interest”) and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax
basis in a note will, in general, be your cost for that note.


-----

Any gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally
will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the note has a holding period of more
than one year at the time of the disposition. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. holders (including
individuals) may be taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain material United States federal income tax consequences that will apply
to non-U.S. holders of the notes.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal withholding tax
will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

    - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

    - you do not actually (or constructively) own stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States
Treasury regulations;

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us actually or constructively through stock
ownership;

    - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8, and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold
your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable
United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are passthrough entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you recognize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business, then you generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on
that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax,
provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied)
in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax


-----

treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject
to adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax
unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, in which
case such gain will generally be subject to United States federal income tax (and possibly branch profits
tax) in the same manner as effectively connected interest as described above; or

    - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on any gain
recognized, which may be offset by certain United States source losses.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the notes and any
proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note paid to you (unless
you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding may apply to any payments described in the
preceding sentence if you fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that you are not
subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to the amount of interest paid to you and the amount
of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside or
are organized under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes,
provided that the applicable withholding agent has received from you the required certification described above in the
fifth bullet point under “—Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds
of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within the United States or
conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the applicable
withholding agent that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code, or you otherwise establish an
exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30%
United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial institution”
(as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with
FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United
States) in a manner which avoids withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the
Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an
exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of
such entity (if any). The foregoing rules generally will apply whether the foreign financial institution or non-financial
foreign entity is the beneficial owner of the notes or an intermediary. If an interest payment is both subject to
withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Certain Tax Consequences
to Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited
against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax.

While withholding under FATCA would generally also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from a
taxable disposition of notes on or after January 1, 2019, proposed United States Treasury regulations (the preamble to
which indicates that taxpayers may rely on the regulations pending their finalization) eliminate FATCA withholding
on payments of gross proceeds entirely. You should consult your tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they
may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes by employee
benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code
or provisions under any U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local, or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to the
foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets,” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section
3(42) of ERISA), of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a
Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a
Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
the suitability of the notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and
instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, prudence, diversification, delegation of control and the
need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a
fiduciary of a Plan should consider a Plan’s particular circumstances and all facts and circumstances of the investment,
including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors.”

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with
respect to the decision to acquire notes pursuant to this offering and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment
advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. All communications, correspondence
and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to be general in nature and are not
directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment
in the notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to acquire notes must be made by each prospective Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis. “Transaction Party” means any of the Issuer, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates, other than an affiliate of an initial purchaser that is a named fiduciary (or a fiduciary appointed by a named
fiduciary) with respect to the management of the assets of the applicable Plan and acting in accordance with an
applicable prohibited transaction exemption (the applicable conditions of which are satisfied).

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA,
or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party
in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that
engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser
or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired
and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply
to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting
life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide limited relief from


-----

the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that
neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary
authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the
transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with
the transaction. Each of these exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries
of a Covered Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other,
exemption should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the exemption and consult with their counsel to
confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with
respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any
such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of
any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA or the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, or any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will
be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire or hold such note constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of such note
by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Transaction
Parties is acting as a fiduciary of such purchaser with respect to the decision to purchase the notes pursuant to the
offering described in this offering memorandum or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give
advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase the notes pursuant to the offering described in
this offering memorandum. No purchaser or subsequent transferee will sell or otherwise transfer such notes or any
interest therein otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations,
warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase and holding of such note or any interest therein.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the
assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the notes. The sale of a note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of
their respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any
offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the notes.

**Offers and Sales by Initial Purchasers**

legend set forth below appears, the notes may be resold, pledged or transferred only (a) to the Issuer, (b) so
long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person whom
the seller reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the
account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (c) in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act, (d) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities

note, by virtue of the fact that the following legend will be placed on the notes unless otherwise agreed to by
the Issuer:

-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as representative (the “Representative”) of each of the several initial
purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement by and among the Issuer, the
guarantors party thereto and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as Representative of the several initial purchasers, the Issuer
has agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of notes.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The initial
purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason and to allot
to any prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The Representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the offering
price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any
other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their
affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial purchasers
propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable
state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or
sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and
sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until
40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer
(whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the
dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and
agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the
notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any
market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the
notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be
adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general
economic conditions and other factors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

During the period of 30 days following the date hereof, the Issuer will not and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of the Representative (which consent may be withheld at the sole


-----

discretion of the Representative), directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer
or establish an open “put equivalent position” within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act, or otherwise
dispose of or transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any registration statement under the Securities Act in respect
of, any debt securities of the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer or securities exchangeable for or convertible into
debt securities of the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement).

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to
purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open
market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward
pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase
in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the
open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither
we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the Representative will engage in these transactions
or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made available
to and should not be offered sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning
of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

**Additional Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore,


-----

offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the
securities in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the under the UK Prospectus
Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum is being distributed only to and directed only at (i) persons who are outside the
United Kingdom, (ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments and fall within
Article 19(5) of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, (as amended, the
“Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies,
unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iv) those persons to whom an invitation or

-----

provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult
with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a nonCanadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts
of interest in connection with this offering.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Some of the
initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other
commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the
future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers
and their respective affiliates may, from time to time, enter into arms-length transactions with us in the ordinary course
of their business. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are lenders and/or agents under our revolving credit
facility and/or our term loan facility.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely, and certain other initial
purchasers or their affiliates may, hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions or credit default swaps could adversely affect future
trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/ or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions or credit default
swaps in such securities and instruments.

An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. acts as the administrative agent under the senior secured credit facilities
and certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates act as lender or agent thereunder and as
consideration therefor, have received or will receive customary fees and expense in connection therewith. In addition,
certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates, may be lenders under our term loan credit facilities and/or
revolving credit facility or may hold our Existing 2025 Notes and therefore may receive a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the      business day following the date of pricing of the notes
(such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days
preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+  , to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisor.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

The validity of the notes offered hereby will be passed upon for us by Kirkland & Ellis LLP, New York, New
York. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the initial purchasers by Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, New York,
New York.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

To the Board of Directors of AssuredPartners, Inc.

**Opinion**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of AssuredPartners, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for the
years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the
Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating
to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for leases in 2022. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.

**Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate,
they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:

    - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.


-----

    - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements.

    - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

    - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable
period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we
identified during the audit.

**Other Information**

Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report (not presented herein).
The other information comprises Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and an Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and
our auditors' report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information,
and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the consolidated
financial statements or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to
describe it in our report.

**1.** **Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

AssuredPartners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
AssuredPartners Group LP (the Parent). The Company is one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States
(U.S.) and provides a broad array of insurance-related products and services on a retail basis to middle-market
businesses, with a particular focus on property and casualty and employee benefits insurance products and solutions.
The Company has over 9,200 employees in approximately 390 offices in forty states across the U.S., the District of
Columbia, United Kingdom (U.K.), Ireland and Belgium. Since its founding in 2011, the Company has built a broad
insurance distribution platform that is concentrated in the U.S. through a strategic acquisition program coupled with
a focus on driving organic growth. Through its operations, the Company provides diversified services to its customers
through a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public entity and professional and individual
customers.

**Principles of Consolidation**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements.

**Use of Estimates**

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial statements. The principal estimates used include, among
others, the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, the
valuation of earn-out payables, revenue recognition, equity-based compensation, assessments regarding potential
impairment of assets, and the estimated fair value of financial instruments. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

**Acquisition Accounting**

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of the Company’s
acquisitions. Intangible assets include noncompete agreements, and customer related and contract-based assets.
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired agency over the net of the fair value of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. The principal factor that results in recognition of goodwill is a combination of
the value the Company expects to receive as it provides additional markets and capabilities to the acquired companies,
as well as the value the Company assigns to the assembled workforce which may not be recognized as an intangible
asset. Noncompete agreements, tradenames, and customer-related and contract-based assets are valued using the
income approach which is based on future cash flow projections. Contingent liabilities that arise from acquisitions,
referred to as earn-out payables, are established and measured at fair value as of the acquisition date.

The amounts recorded as earn-out payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of
the acquired entities over a one- to three-year period and are recorded as part of the purchase price consideration. The
fair value of the earn-out payables is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the
sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. The
Company estimates future payments using the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase
agreement and these financial projections. In determining fair value, the Company estimates the acquired entity’s
future performance using financial projections developed by management and market participant assumptions that
were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. The Company utilizes an option-pricing approach to incorporate
the risks associated with financial projections, counterparty credit risk, as well as the nature of the earn-out payout
structure. The Company remeasures these estimated earn-out payables on a quarterly basis. Subsequent changes,
including the accretion of discount and changes in fair value, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income.


-----

The Company also acquires other assets and assumes other liabilities that typically include accounts
receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of
these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the fair values that are recorded on the balance sheet of the
acquired business.

**Transaction Expenses**

In the process of acquiring companies, the Company incurs certain incremental costs associated with
consummating the transactions. These costs are expensed as incurred and include, but are not limited to, fees paid for
legal, advisory, accounting and valuation experts.

**Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

_Commissions and Fees. Commission revenues are recognized on the effective date of the insurance policy,_
which is the date that the control of the insurance policy transfers to the customer upon satisfaction of the related
performance obligation. Fee revenues, negotiated in lieu of commissions, are recognized in the same manner as
commission revenue. Fee revenues generated from other services, which include but are not limited to third party
claims administration and other risk management consulting services, are recognized throughout the contract term, as
the services are rendered, and the related performance obligation is satisfied. Fee revenues received in advance are
deferred until the related performance obligation is satisfied which is either on effective date of the insurance policy
or over the term of the insurance policy as services transfer to the customer. In certain circumstances, the Company
provides more than one performance obligation to the customer that is comprised of placement of an insurance policy
and other post-placement services. For consideration allocated to the placement of an insurance policy, the Company
recognizes revenue on the policy effective date. Remaining consideration is allocated to other performance obligations
based on their relative fair values over the term of the insurance policy, which is generally one year or less, as the
services are rendered.

_Contingent Revenue. Supplemental and profit-sharing contingent commissions represent variable_
consideration from insurance carriers that may be received in certain cases separate from commissions and fees and
are generally received within one year. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that
is above the base commission paid, is based on historical performance criteria, and is established annually in advance
of the contractual period. A profit-sharing contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier and is
based on, among other things, the overall underwriting results and/or growth of the business placed with that insurance
carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. These revenues are variable in
nature and not determinable until all contingencies are resolved and therefore estimated and recognized at which time
significant reversal of contingent revenue is not probable. As such, these contingent revenues are estimated and
accrued on the effective date of an insurance policy, with an amount of consideration that will be received from the
insurance carrier in the following year.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents principally consist of demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid
investments with quoted market prices with maturities not more than three months when purchased.

**Restricted Cash**

Certain of the Company’s cash balances are contractually limited or are generally designated for specific
purposes arising out of other obligations. These cash balances are classified as restricted cash in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash includes amounts that have been pledged as collateral for an appeal
bond in connection with a legal case for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 13 for further discussion.

**Trust Cash, Company Payables and Accounts Receivable, net**

Unremitted net insurance premiums are held in a fiduciary capacity until the Company disburses them. The
Company invests these unremitted funds primarily in cash and money market accounts. In certain states in which the


-----

Company operates, the use of investment alternatives for these funds are regulated and restricted by various state laws
and agencies. These restricted funds are reported as trust cash and company payables on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The interest income earned on these unremitted funds is reported as other income in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The Company’s accounts receivable, net is comprised of premiums and commissions receivable. In its
capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company typically collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting
its authorized commissions, remits the net premiums to the appropriate insurance carrier or carriers. Accordingly,
premium receivables are accounts receivable from the insureds. In other circumstances, insurance carriers collect
premiums directly from the insureds themselves and upon collection, the insurance carriers remit to the Company its
earned commissions. Accordingly, commissions receivables are accounts receivable from insurance carriers.

**Investments**

The Company indirectly owns a captive insurance company (the Captive) formed and domiciled in the state
of Hawaii. The Captive’s investments are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as availablefor-sale, which are recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of investments sold is based on the
specific identification method. Premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method. Investment expenses
are included in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

For mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), the Company recognizes income
using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments over the economic life of the security. Prepayment
assumptions are based on market expectations. When actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated
prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments, and
any resulting adjustment is included in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.

The Company assesses whether other-than-temporary impairments (OTTIs) have occurred based upon the
Company’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value. All securities
with a gross unrealized loss at the balance sheet date are subject to the Company’s process for identifying OTTIs. The
Company considers a wide range of factors and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the
estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery.

Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to,
the following:

    - The duration and extent that the estimated fair value has been below the net carrying amount

    - Industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area that are negatively affecting the security

    - Underlying valuation of assets specifically pledged to support the credit

    - Past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants

    - Deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specified issuer

    - Downgrades by a rating agency

    - Intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security
before the recovery of amortized cost

    - Fundamental analysis of the liquidity and financial condition of the specified issuer


-----

If the Company determines that an OTTI has occurred, an OTTI will be recognized equal to the entire
difference between the fixed maturity security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the reporting date consisting
of credit and non-credit components. The credit component is recognized in earnings, while the non-credit component
is recognized in other comprehensive income. After the recognition of OTTI, the security is accounted for as if it had
been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI and the fair value on the date of the OTTI becomes the new cost
basis for the security.

**Concentration of Credit Risk**

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of
investments. The Company’s investments are available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in corporate and government
obligations, as well as non-agency MBS and ABS. These investments are managed by professional investment
managers under investment guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, there was no significant concentration of financial
instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.

**Fixed Assets, net**

Fixed assets, net are recorded at cost at the time of purchase or fair value at the date of acquisition and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold
improvements are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for leasehold
improvements are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred.
Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred for internally developed and
licensed software upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Software licenses which are part of cloud computing hosting
arrangements are capitalized only if the Company can take possession of the software at any time without significant
penalty and can run the software on its own (or on an independent third party’s) hardware; otherwise, such costs are
expensed as incurred. Costs for capitalizable projects which are not yet current complete are classified as construction
in process and are not amortized until they are put into use. Depreciation for fixed assets computed using the straightline method is calculated using the following estimated useful lives:

**Asset Category** **Useful Life**
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 7 years
Office equipment 5 years
Computer equipment 3 years
Software 3 years
Leasehold improvements Length of lease or 5 years, whichever is less

**Goodwill and Intangible Assets**

The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible
net assets is assigned to goodwill. The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, and
more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances, by applying a fair value-based test.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level by either performing a qualitative
assessment or a quantitative test. The qualitative assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant
events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As of September 30, 2022, the Company performed a quantitative
impairment test, in which the Company compared the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to
determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. The Company determined no impairment was required and there were no events or changes
since the period following the annual impairment review through December 31, 2022 that caused the Company to
perform an interim period impairment assessment.


-----

Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Customer-related and
contract-based assets, noncompete agreements, and tradenames are amortized over the related estimated lives and
contract periods, which range from five to twenty years generally on a straight-line basis as the related benefits are
consumed. Customer-related and contract-based assets primarily consist of records and files that contain information
about insurance policies and the related insured parties that are essential to policy renewals. Favorable lease assets or
unfavorable lease liabilities that arise from business combinations before the adoption of Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 842 are amortized over the remaining term of the respective lease agreements.

Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In reviewing intangible assets for
recoverability, if the future expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the respective asset,
the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the
assets. There were no events that would trigger the company to perform the impairment analysis for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses**

The Captive is licensed as a Class 4 sponsored captive insurance company and, as such, is authorized to be a
reinsurer and direct writer of insurance. The Captive writes and reinsures workers’ compensation business and excess
liability business only for policyholders associated with a subsidiary of the Company.

Unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses consist of (1) case or claims reserves for known claims that are
unpaid as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported reserves for claims when the insured event has
occurred but has not been reported to the Company; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected costs
of settling these claims. The Company estimates incurred but not yet reported losses using actuarial principles and
assumptions based on settlement factors derived from its historical experiences, which reflect judgments and possible
adjustments based on data such as historical and projected claim incidence patterns, claim size, expected payment
patterns and period. The Company recognizes the best estimate of the ultimate liability under moderately adverse
conditions. The methods for making such estimates, and for establishing the resulting liability, are continually
reviewed and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred expenses associated with current period
claims of approximately $9.3 million offset by prior period adjustments of approximately $1.9 million and made loss
and loss adjustment expense payments associated with current and prior period claims of approximately $1.8 million
and $5.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred expenses associated
with 2021 claims of approximately $7.7 million offset by prior period adjustments of approximately $1.9 million and
made loss and loss adjustment expense payments associated with 2021 and prior period claims of approximately $1.0
million and $4.7 million, respectively. Incurred expenses and prior period adjustments related to the Captive are within
Administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements.

**Debt Issuance costs**

Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are directly deducted from the carrying amount of
debt liability. These costs, along with debt discounts, are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt using the
effective interest method. Upfront commitment fees associated with the Company’s revolving loan credit facility are
capitalized and amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement.

**Derivatives**

The Company enters into hedging contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) to manage the associated interest
rate risk in its variable interest rate debt obligations at what management believes are acceptable levels. These debt
obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. The Company
believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments and the Company has protected against
future increases in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives variable
interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments on a portion of its debt to a designated counterparty.


-----

The interest rate cap agreement, which takes effect on March 31, 2023, reduces the Company’s exposure to variability
in interest-related cash outflows beyond the specified strike rate associated with forecasted variable-rate debt.

The fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an
asset or liability with the related gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). Changes in fair value are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings as an
adjustment to interest expense in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

**Equity-based Compensation**

The Company’s employees are participants in The AssuredPartners Group LP Equity Incentive Plan
(Incentive Plan), an equity incentive plan sponsored by the Parent which awards equity units of the Parent to certain
participating employees of the Company who have substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the
Company. These awards are accounted for as stock-based compensation awards under ASC 718. Compensation
expense for these awards is measured as the grant-date fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes pricing model
and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the vesting terms of
the employees’ agreements.

**Defined Contribution Plan**

The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan covering all employees of the Company that are at least
21 years old and have completed at least one month of service. Under this plan, the Company makes matching
contributions of up to 3.0% of each participant’s annual compensation. Company matching contributions to the plan
were approximately $8.6 million and $7.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Income Taxes**

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates which apply to the taxable income in years in which these
temporary differences are expected to impact taxable income. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities because
of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment
date under law.

The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. All significant available positive and negative evidence is
considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required, which includes, but is not limited to, the
Company’s estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies. Establishment or reversal of
certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results. For uncertain tax
positions, ASC 740 prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial
statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company
records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

**New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted**

In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update
(ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12). The
amendments in ASU 2019-12 simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions and
clarifying and amending certain aspects of existing guidance. For non-public business entities, ASU 2019-12 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after


-----

December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance in 2022; it did not have a material impact
on the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02) and its related updates,
amendments and technical improvements, which requires, among other things, lessees to recognize assets and
liabilities for most leases. Under the new standard and its various amendments, a lessee is required to recognize in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, liabilities to make future lease payments and operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets
representing its right to use the underlying assets for the lease term. The recognition, measurement, timing, and
presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous
U.S. GAAP.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840. Under ASC 840,
leases were categorized as either capital or operating leases and the Company recognized rent expense related to leased
space on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between rent expense and rent paid, if any, is
recorded as deferred rent in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2022, using the transition alternative adoption
method for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the period of adoption. Under this approach, prior periods were
not restated. Rather, lease balances and other disclosures for prior periods were provided in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements as previously reported, and the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance
was recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company elected the package of practical expedients under ASC 842, which allows a lessee to
carryforward their population of existing leases, the classification of each lease, as well as the treatment of initial
direct costs as of the period of adoption. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate nonlease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. The
Company did not elect the practical expedient related to hindsight analysis which allows a lessee to use hindsight in
determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of the entity’s ROU assets. The application of the practical
expedient did not have a significant impact on the measurement of the operating lease liability.

The Company has elected to not recognize ROU assets and operating lease liabilities that arise from leases
with an initial term of twelve months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This population consists primarily
of the Company’s non-real estate leases. However, the Company will recognize these lease payments in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income over the lease term and variable lease payments
in the period in which the obligation is incurred. The Company has applied this accounting policy across all classes
of underlying assets.

Beginning January 1, 2022, ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Operating leases in effect prior to January 1,
2022 were recognized at the present value of the remaining payments on the remaining lease term as of January 1,
2022. Upon adoption, the Company recognized ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $150.8
million. There was no adjustment to retained earnings. Additionally, all operating lease-related balances, such as
deferred rent accruals, reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 were
reclassified as an adjustment to the opening ROU asset balance in accordance with the new guidance on January 1,
2022. The standard had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and a
non-cash impact on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 12 for further information including
significant assumptions and judgments made.

As a result of applying the transition alternative adoption method, the following adjustments were made to
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2022:

**December 31,** **Impacts from** **January 1,**

Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent portion ......... — 117,206 117,206

(1) Current operating lease liabilities are included in Accrued expenses and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, _Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):_
_Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance and its amendments, which have now_
been codified as ASC 326, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the
reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forward-looking information, which
is intended to result in more timely recognition of such losses. The new guidance adds an allowance for credit losses
impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The new standard also makes targeted
changes to the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. Specifically, credit losses identified in
securities available for sale are recorded through the use of an allowance, rather than a direct write-down of the
security. Such write-downs are reversed in the event of recovery of the credit loss. The new standard is effective for
the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. The
Company does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2021-08, _Business_
_Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers._
The amendment requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract
liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the
provisions of this standard but does not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**2.** **Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

**Disaggregation of Revenue**

_Property & Casualty (P&C): The Company’s P&C products and services are comprised of a broad range of_
insurance lines that are offered to middle-market businesses, public institutions, and individuals.

_Employee Benefits (EB): The Company places EB products and provides consulting and administrative_
support services on both fully insured and self-insured EB plan structures for employers of all sizes.

_Services & Other: The Company offers various services which include, but are not limited to, risk_
management, consulting, and third-party administration services to customers in a wide variety of industries.

The following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers, disaggregated by type of revenue

**Contract Balances**

The Company presents accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which includes the
following components:

**December 31,** **December 31,**
**2022** **2021**

Billed receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts ................................. $ 344,226 $ 265,103
Unbilled receivables ............................................................................................ 332,389 288,042
Contract assets .................................................................................................... 51,668 64,416
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts .......................... $ 728,283 $ 617,561
Deferred revenue, current portion ....................................................................... $ 50,040 $ 42,925
Deferred revenue, noncurrent portion ................................................................. 43,081 39,235
Contract Liabilities .......................................................................................... $ 93,121 $ 82,160

The Company records billed receivables when the right to consideration is unconditional, subject only to the
passage of time. Unbilled receivables arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet
been billed in the Company’s systems but for which some or all performance obligations have been met. Additionally,
contract assets relate to relationships with customers where the Company has completed some or all performance
obligations under the contract, however, the Company’s right to the receipt of consideration is conditional. These
contract assets primarily relate to profit-sharing contingent commissions from insurance carriers for which the revenue
cannot be collected until all contingencies are resolved which typically occurs in the following year after the end of
the contract period.

Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the Company satisfying performance
obligations under its contracts. Contract liabilities are reported as Deferred revenue, current portion and Deferred
revenue, noncurrent portion in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Deferred Costs**

Costs incurred by the Company to obtain a customer contract (costs to obtain) are capitalized and amortized
over 15 years based on the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
costs to obtain of approximately $49.6 million and $38.4 million, respectively, are recorded within noncurrent assets,
net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs to
fulfill a customer contract (costs to fulfill), are capitalized and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the
transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, costs to fulfill of approximately $82.1 million and $76.0 million, respectively, are recorded within
other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**3.** **Business Combinations**

The Company completed 44 acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 54 acquisitions
during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company acquired substantially all the net assets of the companies
primarily in exchange for cash and accounted for these acquisitions using the acquisition method for recording
business combinations. The results of the acquired companies are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income from the date of acquisition. Certain amounts recorded reflect management’s
best estimate at the balance sheet date and may change during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from
date of acquisition). During the year ended December 31, 2022, adjustments made within the permitted measurement
period resulted in an increase to goodwill as disclosed in Note 6 and resulted primarily from measurement adjustments
to decrease definite-lived intangible assets and increase deferred income tax liabilities, net.

Unrealized losses were primarily due to interest rate fluctuations and market movements during the year and
are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as the Company does not intend to sell the investments and
it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their
amortized costs. Accordingly, no losses were recognized from OTTIs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

**Credit Facility**

The Company’s Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) consists of (i) first lien term loans (First Lien Term
Loans), and (ii) a revolving loan credit facility (Revolver Loans). All obligations under the Credit Facility are
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries. All obligations and guarantees of such
obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject
to certain exceptions.

The First Lien Term Loans accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Secured
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin of 3.50% - 4.25%. They are not subject to any
maintenance financial covenants and they mature in February 2027.

The Revolver Loans have borrowing limits up to approximately $414.5 million and are scheduled to mature
in August 2026. Borrowings under the Revolver Loans accrue interest at SOFR, plus an applicable margin of 3.50%.
The Revolver Loans are subject to a springing leverage covenant in the event the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Revolver Loans plus letters of credit exceed 35% of the revolving commitment at the end of each fiscal
quarter. Upon becoming subject to the springing covenant, the required ratio of first lien indebtedness (First Lien Term
Loans outstanding less operating cash) to EBITDA cannot exceed 7.50:1. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative
covenants (e.g., the Company is required to make certain prepayments out of cash flow) and negative covenants (e.g.,
the Company is limited from incurring additional indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s equity unit
holders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each case, as otherwise permitted).

The LIBOR index, used by existing loans under the Credit Facility, was discontinued immediately after
December 31, 2021 for one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings and is expected to be discontinued at the end of
June 2023 for remaining U.S. dollar settings. The Company’s Credit Facility includes provisions for the administrative
agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate (i.e., SOFR) at such point
in time when applicable LIBOR rates are no longer available or no longer deemed reliable.

During 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility for incremental borrowings and amended the
Revolver’s terms. The table below represents the key terms of the amendments.

**First Lien Term**
**Loans Borrowed** **Applicable margin in**

**Debt Amendment** **Date of Amendment** **(in millions)** **addition to SOFR** **Maturity Date**

Credit Facility February 2, 2022[(1)] $ 850.00 3.50% February 2027
Revolver November 1, 2022[(2)] — 3.50% August 2026
Credit Facility November 16, 2022[(3)] 500.00 4.25% February 2027


(1) The Company used the proceeds to pay in full outstanding balances of the Delayed Draw Term Loans and the Revolver
Loans. The Company incurred a debt loss of $4.1 million upon the repayment of the Delayed Draw Term Loans in
addition to the $2.1 million discount of the borrowings.
(2) The amendment replaced LIBOR w ith SOFR for all Revolver facility borrowings with no change to the applicable
margin and increased the letter of credit sublimit from million to $100.0 million.
(3) The discount of the borrowings totaled approximately $17.5 million and the interest accrued of SOFR plus an
applicable margin are subject to a 0.50% floor.

During 2021, the Company amended the Credit Facility. The table below represents the key terms of the
amendments.

**First Lien Term**
**Loans Borrowed** **Applicable margin in**

**Debt Amendment** **Date of Amendment** **(in millions)** **addition to LIBOR** **Maturity Date**

Credit Facility July 6, 2021[(1)] $ 200.75 3.50% February 2027
Credit Facility October 1, 2021[(2)] 350.00 3.50% February 2027


(1) The applicable margin f or the incremental borrowings is subject to a 0.50% LIBOR floor and repriced certain
borrowings from prior amendments.


-----

(2) The discount of the borrowings totaled approximately $5.3 million.

**Notes**

The Company issued the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, and 2029 Notes (the Notes) at par on the following dates
as shown in the table below. The Notes may be individually redeemed in whole, or in part, at any time prior to the
respective initial redemption dates as shown in the table below, at a redemption price calculated using a formula
designed to provide the bondholders with a make-whole premium. Before the initial redemption dates, the Company
may also individually redeem the respective Notes, on one or more occasions, at an initial redemption price as noted
below, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the respective Notes in an amount not to exceed the net cash
proceeds of certain equity offerings provided that at least 50% of the respective Notes from their respective original
issue date remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. After the initial redemption dates, the Company
may redeem the respective notes at the following redemption prices:

**2025 Notes** **2027 Notes** **2029 Notes**

For the Notes, if the Company experiences certain change of control events, the Company is required to offer
to repurchase at 101% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Notes also
include a change of control portability feature whereby the Company does not have to make an offer to repurchase
(and holders of the notes do not have the ability to require such repurchase), so long as the change of control qualifies
as a Permitted Change of Control. In order to qualify as a Permitted Change of Control, on the date of the change of
control:

a. The Company’s Moody’s corporate rating must be B3 (stable) or better, and the Company’s S&P
corporate rating must be B (stable) or better; and

b. The Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined) is equal to or less than 6.85x (for the 2025
Notes) and 7.00x (for the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes, respectively).

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint-and-several basis by the Company’s 100%
owned domestic subsidiaries. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are senior in right of
payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and rank equally in right of payment
with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including the existing Credit Facility obligations.
The Notes are effectively subordinated to the obligations under the existing Credit Facility, to the extent of the value
of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes were issued in private transactions that are not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, or the ongoing reporting requirements of the Securities Act of
1934.

Changes in fair value are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings as
an adjustment to interest expense in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings. Accordingly, approximately
$(25.7) million and $25.0 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), before taxes
to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**9.** **Equity and Equity-based Compensation**

**Class C Profits Interest Units**

Class C Profits Interest Units are time-based incentive units awarded to select employees under provisions
of the Incentive Plan, which will vest over five years generally from the date of grant subject to the employees’

Vested or expected to vest at December 31, 2022 .................................... 77,800,937

The fair value of Award Units was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model
that uses various assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility of a
comparable group of entities within similar industries that are public entities, along with other factors. The expected
term of the units granted represents the time period that these profits interest units were expected to be outstanding at
the time of grant. The Parent’s expected term of the units is based on historical experience, giving consideration to the
contractual terms of the equity-based awards, vesting schedules, and expectations of future employee behavior. The
risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury yields for the expected term of the Award Units.

The fair value of each Award Unit grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The assumptions used to value Award units issued in 2022 and 2021, and the weighted average grant-date fair
value, of those awards, are as follows:

**2022** **2021**
Risk-free interest rate ............................................................................................. 4.18% 0.47%

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits or associated interest or penalties
recorded.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $171.5 million and
$19.7 million net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax reporting purposes. The federal NOL consists of
amounts that carryforward indefinitely. The state NOL consists of amounts which expire depending on corresponding
state statutes, portions of which will begin to expire in 2027 and portions which carryforward indefinitely.

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which included a broad range of tax relief including
reduced limitation to interest expense deductions enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), relief to limits on
NOL carrybacks enacted by the TCJA, payroll tax deferrals, and tax credits aimed to provide broad relief to individuals


-----

and businesses directly and indirectly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with ASC 740, tax effects
of changes in tax laws or rates are accounted for in the period of enactment. The Company utilized the payroll tax
deferral provision which resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately $2.5 million at December 31, 2021. No
deferred tax asset existed at December 31, 2022.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. Management has assessed the
legislative change and has determined there are currently no material impacts to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s net deferred tax assets include a valuation allowance of $7.2 million as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, related to state NOLs. The state NOLs may be carried forward to offset future taxable income.
Realization is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOLs.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had income attributable to foreign
subsidiaries of approximately $4.8 and $4.0 million, respectively. The TCJA, enacted in 2017, subjects a U.S.
shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The
Company elected to utilize current NOL carryforwards to offset the GILTI taxable inclusion and therefore did not
record any related income tax payable for U.S. federal tax purposes.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in the U.S. and U.K. The Company’s U.S. federal
returns are subject to examination for the years 2016 and later, due to NOLs generated in 2016. The Company’s state
returns are subject to examination for the years 2011 and later due to net operating losses generated in 2011 and
subsequent years. The Company’s U.K. and Belgium returns for the 2021 year are subject to examination and the
Company’s Ireland returns for the 2021 year are subject to examination indefinitely.

**11.** **Fair Value of Measurements and Financial Instruments**

As defined by the FASB, the Company established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets;

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, that are observable either
directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the use of valuation
techniques and the development of assumptions.

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments that are measured on a recurring basis:

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents;
restricted cash; trust cash; accounts receivable; accounts payable; customer advances; producer payables; reserve for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses; contract assets; contract liabilities and deferred revenue at December 31,
2022 and 2021 approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Interest rate contracts are valued using pricing models that are based on certain assumptions and readily
observable market-based inputs, including yield curves and implied volatilities of closely related instruments, for
which transparent pricing is available. The Company reflects the credit considerations inherent in the derivative
contracts with both positive and negative exposures over the remaining life of the derivative. The credit spreads
calculated for each party (e.g., the hedging entity and the bank counterparty) are converted into default probabilities.
The default probabilities of the hedging entity are applied to the negative exposures, resulting in a positive credit
adjustment, and the default probabilities of the bank counterparty are applied to the positive exposures, resulting in a
negative credit adjustment. The bilateral credit valuation adjustment is the sum of the positive and negative
adjustments.


-----

Earn-out payables are recorded at fair value based on the present value of the expected future payments that
are to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities. The Company estimates the future performance of acquired
entities using financial projections that are primarily based on EBITDA or revenue targets to be achieved over one to
three years. The expected future payments are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into
consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entities to achieve the target EBITDA
or revenue. Revenue growth rates generally range from 3.0% to 5.0% and the discount rates generally range from
5.0% to 12.0%. On a quarterly basis, the Company reassesses its current estimates of performance relative to the
financial targets and adjusts the liability to fair value. Changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions
for revenue growth and profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in fair value of
recorded earn-out payables. See Note 3 for a reconciliation of acquisition earn-out payables measured at fair value on
a recurring basis in the table below that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Corporate bonds (foreign and domestic) are valued by models using inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data. In the instance that observable market data is unavailable, the Company
incorporates inputs from third-party sources and applies reasonable judgment in developing assumptions used to
estimate the probability of collecting all contractual cash flows.

U.S. government and agency securities are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services
and based on expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity
of the investments.

For asset-backed securities, including residential MBS, commercial MBS, and other ABS, the Company uses
values obtained from independent pricing services. The independent pricing service may consider various factors in
determining fair value, including but not limited to, the type of security, issuer-specific news and/or long-term outlook,
market conditions and other relevant information, size and position in the issuer’s capital structure, information
available in the issuer’s financial statements or other reports, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities
of the issuer or comparable companies, and/or factors deemed relevant and appropriate.

The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

**12.** **Leases**

The Company enters into lease agreements from time to time primarily for the use of real estate for office
space. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract, and the nature of the
Company’s operations is such that it is generally clear whether an arrangement contains a lease and what underlying
asset is being leased. Most of the leases into which the Company enters are operating leases. Upon entering into leases,
the Company obtains the right to control the use of an identified space for a lease term and recognize these ROU assets
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets with corresponding lease liabilities reflecting the Company’s
obligation to make the related lease payments. ROU assets are amortized over the term of the lease.

The Company’s real estate leases are generally long-term in nature, with terms that typically range from 5 to
15 years. The Company excludes options to extend or terminate a lease from recognition as part of the Company’s
ROU assets and operating lease liabilities until those options are reasonably certain and/or executed. The Company’s
lease agreements typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

In addition to payments for previously-agreed base rent, many of the Company’s lease agreements are subject
to variable and unknown future payments, typically in the form of common area maintenance charges (a non-lease
component as defined by ASC 842) or real estate taxes. These variable payments are excluded from the Company’s
operating lease liabilities and ROU assets, and instead are recognized as lease expense within administrative expenses
on the Consolidated Statements Operations and Comprehensive Income as the amounts are incurred. Variable lease
costs are immaterial to the Company.

To the extent that the Company has agreed to fixed charges for common area maintenance or other non-lease
components, or the Company’s base rent increases by an index or rate (most commonly an inflation rate), these
amounts are included in the measurement of the Company’s operating lease liabilities and related assets.

From time to time the Company may enter into subleases if it is unable to cancel or fully occupy a space and
are able to find an appropriate subtenant. However, entering subleases is not a primary objective of the Company’s
business operations and these arrangements represent an immaterial amount of cash flows.

The Company utilizes discount rates to determine the present value of the lease payments based on
information available at the commencement date of the lease. The Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based


-----

on factors such as the lease term, the Company’s credit rating and current market valuations for similarly rated credits
in the market, as the rate implicit in the lease is not always readily available. Incremental borrowing rates are updated
quarterly and the new rates are used for the acquired leases and lease modifications occurring in the following quarter.

The classification of ROU asset and liability balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows
(in thousands). Finance lease assets, included within Fixed assets, net, and Finance lease liabilities, included within
Long-term debt, net, current portion and Long-term debt, net are considered immaterial.

-----

The Company occupies and leases certain office space owned by employees of the Company. Rent expense
incurred for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 under these leases, which is included in the total rent
expense above, was approximately $10.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively.

**13.** **Commitments and Contingencies**

In February 2019, a plaintiff filed suit against his employer and against the Company’s indirectly-owned
subsidiary, AP Keenan, who served as the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance administrator, alleging that
he was wrongfully terminated from his employment. The plaintiff alleged that AP Keenan repeatedly provided
inaccurate medical reports to his employer. Before trial, the plaintiff’s employer settled with the plaintiff and agreed
to testify that had AP Keenan provided accurate medical reports, the employer would not have fired the plaintiff in
January 2018 and would have rehired him in June 2018. In May 2022, a trial jury returned a liability verdict finding
that AP Keenan had aided and abetted the employer’s violation of California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act
and that AP Keenan had also conspired with the employer to violate the Act. The jury awarded the plaintiff
approximately $6.9 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages of approximately $27.6 million bringing
the total damages awarded against the Company to approximately $34.5 million. The Company is appealing these
findings and believes that it has a reasonable chance of substantially reducing this award on appeal. Any damages that
may result are expected to be fully covered by third-party insurance policies. Restricted cash on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 includes approximately $52.0 million which has been pledged as collateral
for an appeals bond in connection with an appeal of this case. The restriction on cash will lapse when the related
litigation is resolved. On the basis of current information, the availability of insurance and legal advice, the Company
does not believe that the resolution of this case, or any others in which the Company is involved, would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, operations, cash flows, individually or in the aggregate.

On October 8, 2021, AP of South Florida, LLC (APSF), an indirectly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
was served with a civil investigative demand (CID) from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The CID seeks
information relating to the operation of Fiorella Insurance Agency, Inc. (Fiorella), certain assets of which were
purchased by APSF in February 2021. The CID seeks information relating to operations before and after the
acquisition of Fiorella by APSF. To date, APSF, through outside counsel, has engaged with the DOJ to respond to
requests for documents and coordinate witness interviews. In connection with the investigation, APSF is working with
a compliance consultant to evaluate operations, identify areas for improvement and to implement compliance
measures.

Other than the matters mentioned above, there are a variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against
the Company. Accruals are recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and
other advisers, and the Company’s experience in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These
amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as
assessment efforts progress or additional information becomes available. The Company expenses amounts for
administering or litigating claims as incurred. Neither the outcomes of these matters nor their effect upon the
Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations can be determined at this time.

**AssuredPartners, Inc.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)**

**Note 1 — Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

AssuredPartners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The AssuredPartners Group
LP (the Parent). The Company is one of the leading insurance brokers in the United States (U.S.) and provides a broad
array of insurance-related products and services on a retail basis to middle-market businesses, with a particular focus
on property and casualty and employee benefits insurance products and solutions. The Company has over 9,900
employees in approximately 410 offices in forty states across the U.S., the District of Columbia, United Kingdom
(U.K.), Ireland and Belgium. Since its founding in 2011, the Company has built a broad insurance distribution platform
that is concentrated in the U.S. through a strategic acquisition program coupled with a focus on driving organic growth.
Through its operations, the Company provides diversified services to its customers through a broad range of insurance
products and services to commercial, public entity and professional and individual customers.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements.

**_Basis of Preparation_**

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. These
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the
Company’s annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial
statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated
financial statements. The principal estimates used include the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of net assets
acquired in connection with acquisitions, the valuation of earn-out payables, revenue recognition, equity-based
compensation, assessments regarding potential impairment of assets, and the estimated fair value of financial
instruments. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

**_Leases_**

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) effective January 1, 2022,
using the transition alternative adoption method for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the period of adoption.
Under this approach, prior periods were not restated. Rather, lease balances and other disclosures for prior periods
were provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as previously reported, and the cumulative effect
of initially applying the guidance was recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022.

The Company enters into lease agreements from time to time primarily for the use of real estate for office space. The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract, and the nature of the Company’s
operations is such that it is generally clear whether an arrangement contains a lease and the nature of the underlying
asset being leased. The Company’s real estate leases are generally long-term in nature, with terms that typically range
from 5 to 15 years. The Company excludes options to extend or terminate a lease from recognition as part of the
Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities until those options are reasonably certain and/or executed. The
Company’s lease agreements typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.


-----

Most of the leases into which the Company enters are operating leases. Upon entering these leases, the Company
obtains the right to control the use of an identified space for a lease term and recognize these right-of-use (ROU) assets
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets with corresponding lease liabilities reflecting the Company’s
obligation to make the related lease payments.

The Company made the short-term lease exemption accounting policy election to not recognize a lease liability or
ROU asset on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Operating lease
expense on ROU assets under operating leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, inclusive
of rent escalation provisions and rent holidays, as a component of other operating expense in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income.

The Company utilizes discount rates to determine the present value of the lease payments based on information
available at the commencement date of the lease. The Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on factors
such as the lease term, the Company’s credit rating and current market valuations for similarly rated credits in the
market, as the rate implicit in the lease is not always readily available. Incremental borrowing rates are updated
quarterly and the new rates are used for the acquired leases and lease modifications occurring in the following quarter.

The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease and lease components and instead account for
them as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. The Company does not include variable payments
that are not based on an index or rate in the single lease component, regardless of whether they are related to the lease
or non-lease component.

From time to time the Company may enter into subleases if it is unable to cancel or fully occupy a space and are able
to find an appropriate subtenant. However, entering subleases is not a primary objective of the Company’s business
operations and these arrangements represent an immaterial amount of cash flows.

**_New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted_**

In September 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments
_– Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new guidance and its_
amendments, which have now been codified as ASC 326, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for
financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forwardlooking information, which is intended to result in more timely recognition of such losses. The new guidance adds an
allowance for credit losses impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The new
standard also makes targeted changes to the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. Credit losses on
available-for-sale debt securities are now limited to the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its
fair value and should be recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct reduction in amortized
cost basis. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the new standard, which did not have a material impact
on the consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
_Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships and_
other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts,
hedging relationships and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another
reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. These amendments, along with the
amendments within ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,
which extended the period companies can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848, may be applied
prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before
December 31, 2024. The LIBOR index, used by existing loans under the Credit Facility, was discontinued immediately
after December 31, 2021 for one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings. The Company’s Credit Facility included
provisions for the administrative agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate
benchmark rate (i.e., Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). In April 2023, the Company and the administrative
agent amended the terms of the Credit Facility (Amendment 18) to replace LIBOR with SOFR. As a result of this
amendment, the Company adopted ASU 2020-04, effective April 1, 2023, which did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.


-----

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from
Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08) which made improvements to the guidance by addressing diversity in
practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their
effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 require that the Company
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with
ASC 606. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 also provide certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing
and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. The
amendments in ASU 2021-08 are effective for non-public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years; however, effective January 1, 2023, the Company elected to
early adopt this new standard, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**Note 2. — Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

_Commissions and Fees. Commission revenues are recognized on the effective date of the insurance policy, which is_
the date that the control of the insurance policy transfers to the customer upon satisfaction of the related performance
obligation. Fee revenues, negotiated in lieu of commissions, are recognized in the same manner as commission
revenue. Fee revenues generated from other services, which include but are not limited to third party claims
administration and other risk management consulting services, are recognized throughout the contract term, as the
services are rendered, and the related performance obligation is satisfied. Fee revenues received in advance are
deferred until the related performance obligation is satisfied which is either on effective date of the insurance policy
or over the term of the insurance policy as services transfer to the customer. In certain circumstances, the Company
provides more than one performance obligation to the customer that is comprised of placement of an insurance policy
and other post-placement services. For consideration allocated to the placement of an insurance policy, the Company
recognizes revenue on the policy effective date. Remaining consideration is allocated to other performance obligations
based on their relative fair values over the term of the insurance policy, which is generally one year or less, as the
services are rendered.

_Contingent Revenue. Supplemental and profit-sharing contingent commissions represent variable consideration from_
insurance carriers that may be received in certain cases separate from commissions and fees and are generally received
within one year. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base
commission paid, is based on historical performance criteria, and is established annually in advance of the contractual
period. A profit-sharing contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier and is based on, among
other things, the overall underwriting results and/or growth of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a
particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. These revenues are variable in nature and not
determinable until all contingencies are resolved and therefore estimated and recognized at which time significant
reversal of contingent revenue is not probable. As such, these contingent revenues are estimated and accrued on the
effective date of an insurance policy.

**_Disaggregation of Revenue_**

_Property & Casualty (P&C): The Company’s P&C products and services are comprised of a broad range of insurance_

**Note 3. — Contract Balances**

The Company presents contract assets and contract liabilities as reflected below:

**September 30,** **December 31,**
_(in thousands)_ **2023** **2022**

Billed receivables, net of allowance for credit losses $ 410,696 $ 344,226
Unbilled receivables 390,812 332,389
Contract assets 69,378 51,668
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses $ 870,886 $ 728,283
Deferred revenue, current portion 53,412 50,040
Deferred revenue, noncurrent portion 44,259 43,081
Contract liabilities $ 97,671 $ 93,121

The Company records billed receivables when the right to consideration is unconditional, subject only to the passage
of time. Unbilled receivables arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet been billed
but for which some or all performance obligations have been met. Additionally, contract assets relate to relationships
with customers where the Company has completed some or all performance obligations under the contract, however,
the Company’s right to the receipt of consideration is conditional. These contract assets primarily relate to profitsharing contingent commissions from insurance carriers for which the revenue cannot be collected until all
contingencies are resolved which typically occurs in the following year after the end of the contract period.

Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations under
its contracts. Contract liabilities are reported as Deferred revenue, current portion and Deferred revenue, noncurrent
portion in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

**_Deferred Costs_**

Costs incurred by the Company to obtain a customer contract (costs to obtain) are capitalized and amortized over 15
years based on the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. As of September 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, costs to obtain of approximately $57.8 million and $49.6 million, respectively, are recorded within
noncurrent assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement
brokerage costs to fulfill a customer contract (costs to fulfill), are capitalized and are amortized on a systematic basis
consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.
As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, costs to fulfill of approximately $47.4 million and $82.1 million,
respectively, are recorded within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


-----

**Note 4. — Business Combinations**

The Company completed 34 acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company acquired
substantially all the net assets of the companies primarily in exchange for cash and accounted for these acquisitions
using the acquisition method for recording business combinations. The results of the acquired companies are included
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income from the date of acquisition. Certain
amounts recorded reflect management’s best estimate at the balance sheet date and may change during the
measurement period (not to exceed one year from date of acquisition). During the nine months ended September 30,
2023, adjustments made within the permitted measurement period resulted in an increase to goodwill as disclosed in
Note 6 and resulted primarily from measurement adjustments to increase definite-lived intangible assets and increase
deferred income tax liabilities, net.

and is amortized over 15 years for income tax purposes starting in the current year and $58.5 million is nondeductible
for income tax purposes. The remaining $98.0 million relates to the acquisition earn-out payables and will not be
deductible until it is earned and paid.

The Company reviews its available-for-sale debt securities for credit loss impairment at the individual security level
on at least a quarterly basis. A security is impaired if its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. A decline in
fair value below amortized cost basis represents a credit loss impairment to the extent the Company does not expect
to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Impairment related to credit losses is recorded through an allowance
for credit losses to the extent fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Declines in fair value that have not been
recorded through the allowance for credit losses are recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable
taxes.

No securities were determined to be credit loss impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or other
than temporarily impaired (OTTI) during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, the
Company did not have an intent to sell securities that were in unrealized loss positions and it was not more likely than
not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which
may be at maturity. In making this determination, the Company considered its current and projected liquidity position,
its investment policy as to permissible holdings and concentration limits, regulatory requirements and other relevant
factors.

A summary of the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities, by contractual maturity, is as follows:

unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs.
(2) Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the revolver loans approximate $2,984 and $3,761 at September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are classified as other current assets.

**_Credit Facility_**

The Company’s Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) consists of (i) first lien term loans (First Lien Term Loans), and
(ii) a revolving loan credit facility (Revolver Loans). All obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally
guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries. All obligations and guarantees of such obligations under the
Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

The First Lien Term Loans accrue interest at LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable
margin of 3.50% - 4.25%. They are not subject to any maintenance financial covenants and they mature in February
2027.

The Revolver Loans have borrowing limits up to approximately $414.5 million and are scheduled to mature in August
2026. Borrowings under the Revolver Loans accrue interest at SOFR, plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The
Revolver Loans are subject to a springing leverage covenant in the event the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolver Loans plus letters of credit exceed 35% of the revolving commitment at the end of each fiscal quarter. Upon
becoming subject to the springing covenant, the required ratio of first lien indebtedness (First Lien Term Loans


-----

outstanding less operating cash) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) cannot
exceed 7.50:1. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative covenants (e.g., the Company is required to make certain
prepayments out of cash flow) and negative covenants (e.g., the Company is limited from incurring additional
indebtedness, making payments to the Company’s equity unit holders and selling certain of its assets, except, in each
case, as otherwise permitted).

During 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility for incremental borrowings and amended the Revolver’s
terms. The table below represents the key terms of the amendments.

**First Lien** **Applicable**
**Term Loans** **margin in**
**Borrowed (in** **addition to**

**Debt Amendment** **Date of Amendment** **millions)** **SOFR** **Maturity Date**

Credit Facility ............ February 2, 2022[(1)] 850.00 3.50% February 2027
Revolver .................... November 1, 2022[(2)]  - 3.50% August 2026
Credit Facility ............ November 16, 2022[(3)] 500.00 4.25% February 2027

(1) The Company used the proceeds to pay in full outstanding balances of the Delayed Draw Term Loans and the
Revolver Loans. The Company incurred a debt extinguishment loss of $4.1 million upon the repayment of the
Delayed Draw Term Loans in addition to the $2.1 million discount of the borrowings.


(2) The amendment replaced LIBOR with SOFR for all Revolver facility borrowings with no change to the applicable
margin and increased the letter of credit sublimit to $100.0 million.

(3) These borrowings were repriced at a discount of approximately $17.5 million and accrue interest at SOFR plus
an applicable margin, subject to a 0.50% floor.

**_Notes_**

The Company issued the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, and 2029 Notes (the Notes) at par on the following dates as shown
in the table below. The Notes may be individually redeemed in whole, or in part, at any time prior to the respective
initial redemption dates as shown in the table below, at a redemption price calculated using a formula designed to
provide the bondholders with a make-whole premium. Before the initial redemption dates, the Company may also
individually redeem the respective Notes, on one or more occasions, at an initial redemption price as noted below, up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the respective Notes in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of
certain equity offerings provided that at least 50% of the respective Notes from their respective original issue date
remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. After the initial redemption dates, the Company may
redeem the respective notes at the following redemption prices:

As it relates to the Notes, if the Company experiences certain change of control events, the Company is required to
offer to repurchase at 101% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Notes
also include a change of control portability feature whereby the Company does not have to make an offer to repurchase
(and holders of the notes do not have the ability to require such repurchase), so long as the change of control qualifies
as a Permitted Change of Control.


-----

In order to qualify as a Permitted Change of Control, on the date of the change of control:

a. The Company’s Moody’s corporate rating must be B3 (stable) or better, and the Company’s S&P
corporate rating must be B (stable) or better; and

b. The Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined) is equal to or less than 6.85x (for the 2025 Notes)
and 7.00x (for the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes, respectively).

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint-and-several basis by the Company’s 100% owned
domestic subsidiaries. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are senior in right of payment
to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all
existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including the existing Credit Facility obligations. The Notes
are effectively subordinated to the obligations under the existing Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. The Notes were issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, or the ongoing reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1934.

Principal maturities of long-term debt at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

**Note 8. — Derivatives and Hedging Arrangements**

The relevant terms of the Company’s interest rate cap contract in effect at September 30, 2023 were as follows:

($ in thousands)
**Interest Rate Cap Contract**

**Purchased**

**Contract Start Date** **Contract End Date** **Original Notional** **Strike Rate** **Benchmark Index**

September 30, 3-month CME
March 31, 2023 ................. 2024 $ 3,500,000 5.25% Term SOFR

As of September 30, 2023, the benchmark index of the interest rate cap did not exceed the strike rate. Approximately
$3.6 million was recorded as interest expense related to the amortization of the interest rate cap premium during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has not received or pledged any collateral related to any
derivative contracts at September 30, 2023.

The Company’s interest rate swap contracts expired on March 31, 2023. Relevant terms of these contracts were as
follows:

($ in thousands)
**Interest Rate Swap Contracts**

**Notional Value at End of**

**Contract Start Date** **Contract End Date** **Contract Period**

May 28, 2021 ............................... March 31, 2023 $ 850,000
May 28, 2021 ............................... March 31, 2023 850,000

Upon expiration of the Company’s interest rate swap contracts, $18.0 million was recognized as a reduction in the fair
value of the related interest rate swap assets, with offsetting reductions of $13.3 million and $4.7 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and non-current deferred tax liabilities, respectively. There was no
earnings impact from the expiration of the Company’s interest rate swap contracts.

Changes in fair value of interest rate contracts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings.
Accordingly, approximately $(18.5) million and $(10.9) million was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), before taxes to interest expense related to the interest rate swap contracts for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The fair value of the Company’s interest rate contracts at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included within
the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:

**Note 9. — Fair Value of Measurements and Financial Instruments**

As defined by the FASB, the Company established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets;

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, that are observable either
directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the use of valuation
techniques and the development of assumptions.

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments
that are measured on a recurring basis:

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents; restricted
cash; trust cash; accounts receivable; accounts payable; customer advances; producer payables; reserve for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses; contract assets; contract liabilities and deferred revenue on September 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022 approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

**_Interest Rate Contracts_**

Interest rate contracts are valued using pricing models that are based on certain assumptions and readily observable
market-based inputs, including yield curves and implied volatilities of closely related instruments, for which
transparent pricing is available. The Company reflects the credit considerations inherent in the derivative contracts
with both positive and negative exposures over the remaining life of the derivative. The credit spreads calculated for
each party (e.g., the hedging entity and the bank counterparty) are converted into default probabilities. The default
probabilities of the hedging entity are applied to the negative exposures, resulting in a positive credit adjustment, and
the default probabilities of the bank counterparty are applied to the positive exposures, resulting in a negative credit
adjustment. The bilateral credit valuation adjustment is the sum of the positive and negative adjustments.

The fair value of the Company’s interest rate contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or
liability with the related gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
as the Company is applying hedge accounting to account for changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments.

**_Earn-Out Payables_**

Earn-out payables are primarily based on meeting EBITDA and revenue targets that occur over one to three years.
The fair value of earn-out payables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows that would result from the
projected revenue and earnings of the acquired entities. On a quarterly basis, the Company reassesses its current
estimates of performance relative to the projection and adjusts the liability to fair value.

**_Fixed Maturity Securities_**

Corporate bonds (foreign and domestic) are valued by models using inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data. In the instance that observable market data is unavailable, the Company
incorporates inputs from third-party sources and applies reasonable judgment in developing assumptions used to
estimate the probability of collecting all contractual cash flows.

U.S. government and agency securities are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services and
based on expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of
the investments.

For asset-backed securities, including residential MBS, commercial MBS, and other ABS, the Company uses values
obtained from independent pricing services. The independent pricing service may consider various factors in
determining fair value, including but not limited to, the type of security, issuer-specific news and/or long-term outlook,


-----

market conditions and other relevant information, size and position in the issuer’s capital structure, information
available in the issuer’s financial statements or other reports, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities
of the issuer or comparable companies, and/or factors deemed relevant and appropriate.

**Note 10. — Income Taxes**

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 4.0% and 45.0%, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of state taxes and permanent tax differences. A
valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses
(NOLs) for which it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized. The Company evaluates the
recoverability of the deferred tax assets on a regular basis based upon all available positive and negative evidence.

and $40.9 million, respectively.

The Company occupies and leases certain office space owned by employees of the Company. Rent expense incurred
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 under these leases, which is included in the total rent expense
above, was approximately $8.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company had additional operating leases that had not commenced of $24.5 million.
These operating leases will commence over the next 12 months.

**Note 12. — Commitments and Contingencies**

In February 2019, a plaintiff filed suit against his employer and against the Company’s indirectly-owned subsidiary,
AP Keenan, who served as the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance administrator, alleging that he was
wrongfully terminated from his employment. The plaintiff alleged that AP Keenan repeatedly provided inaccurate
medical reports to his employer. Before trial, the plaintiff’s employer settled with the plaintiff and agreed to testify
that had AP Keenan provided accurate medical reports, the employer would not have fired the plaintiff in January
2018 and would have rehired him in September 2018. In May 2022, a trial jury returned a liability verdict finding that
AP Keenan had aided and abetted the employer’s violation of California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act and that
AP Keenan had also conspired with the employer to violate the Act. The jury awarded the plaintiff approximately $6.9
million in compensatory damages and punitive damages of approximately $27.6 million bringing the total damages
awarded against the Company to approximately $34.5 million. The Company is appealing these findings and believes
that it has a reasonable chance of substantially reducing this award on appeal. Any damages that may result are
expected to be fully covered by third-party insurance policies. Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of September 30, 2023 includes approximately $57.8 million which has been pledged as collateral for an appeals bond
in connection with an appeal of this case. The restriction on cash will lapse when the related litigation is resolved. On
the basis of current information, the availability of insurance and legal advice, the Company does not believe that the
resolution of this case, or any others in which the Company is involved, would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, operations or cash flows, individually or in the aggregate.

On October 8, 2021, AP of South Florida, LLC (APSF), an indirectly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was served
with a civil investigative demand (CID) from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The CID seeks information
relating to the operation of Fiorella Insurance Agency, Inc. (Fiorella), certain assets of which were purchased by APSF
in February 2021. The CID seeks information relating to operations before and after the acquisition of Fiorella by
APSF. To date, APSF, through outside counsel, has engaged with the DOJ to respond to requests for documents and
coordinate witness interviews. In connection with the investigation, APSF is working with a compliance consultant to
evaluate operations, identify areas for improvement and to implement compliance measures.

Additionally, in December 2023, we learned that special agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation had executed
search warrants on two APSF employees for their personal devices. After communications with DOJ Criminal
Division trial attorneys, we accepted service in early January 2024 of a criminal grand jury subpoena to APSF. The
grand jury subpoena seeks information and documents among other things, related to operation of Fiorella before and
after APSF’s purchase of certain Fiorella assets as it pertains to the sale of Florida Blue health plans. The Company
is working with external counsel and is cooperating with DOJ and responding to the grand jury subpoena.

On August 27, 2023, Keenan & Associates discovered certain disruptions occurring on some Keenan network servers.
Keenan activated its incident response plan and engaged leading third-party cybersecurity and forensic experts to
investigate and remediate. In relatively short order, Keenan restored full functionality to its systems and was able to
minimize business disruption. The incident was the result of ransomware. Due to the nature of the incident, Keenan
was obligated to provide legally-required notices regarding the incident to a number of its business partners and their
respective employees and to certain government agencies. Furthermore, the Company has been notified that it is the
subject of two class action lawsuits regarding the incident. The amount of any claims and related costs, if any, cannot
be estimated at this time and as such, no provision has been made. The ultimate outcome of this litigation is unknown
at this time. The Company may become party to additional complaints as a result of the incident. The Company
continues to monitor the situation and the notification process is ongoing and is anticipated to be completed by the
end of the first quarter of 2024.

Other than the matters mentioned above, there are a variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against the
Company. Accruals are recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and other
advisers, and the Company’s experience in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These amounts,
which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment
efforts progress or additional information becomes available. The Company expenses amounts for administering or
litigating claims as incurred. Neither the outcomes of these matters nor their effect upon the Company’s business,
financial condition or results of operations can be determined at this time.

**Note 14. — Subsequent events**

The Company is required to evaluate events and transactions occurring subsequent to September 30, 2023 through
February 6, 2024, the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.

In October 2023, the Company amended its Credit Facility (Nineteenth Amendment) to borrow an additional $400
million in First Lien Term Loans, and to reprice the borrowings made under the Sixteenth Amendment to its Credit
Facility. These borrowings were repriced at par and now accrue interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin of
3.75% (a reduction from the prior margin of 4.25%). These borrowings mature in 2027 and are not fungible with
previous First Lien Term Loan borrowings.

During this period, the Company acquired substantially all the net assets of 20 companies with cash consideration
paid of $593.9 million and maximum potential earn-out payables of $131.5 million. The nature of all businesses
acquired are similar in all material respects to the acquisitions previously completed by the Company, and as such
the Company expects the purchase price to be allocated in a similar manner. As part of the funding of these
transactions, the Company drew $75 million on its Revolver in December 2023.
