1614_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are the world’s largest hotel franchising company by number of hotels, with over 9,000 affiliated hotels with 812,900 rooms located in approximately 90 countries and welcoming nearly 150 million guests annually worldwide. Our 20 brands are primarily located in secondary and tertiary cities and approximately 80% of the U.S. population lives within ten miles of at least one of our affiliated hotels. Our mission is to make hotel travel possible for all. Wherever people go, Wyndham will be there to welcome them. We boast a remarkably asset-light business model with only two of our over 9,000 hotels being owned, dramatically limiting our capital needs and our exposure to real estate and the rising wage environment. In 2019, Wyndham Hotels generated net revenues of $2,053 million, net income of $157 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $613 million. Our business is fueled by leisure travelers, representing 70% of our bookings. We are not reliant on group business. The other 30% of bookings is generated from contract business where travel is essential, such as transportation, utility, logistics and infrastructure industries or essential front-line emergency, medical or government workers. This business is predictable and dependable. Our portfolio of hotels is not reliant on air travel rather it is predominately “drive to” - approximately 90% of our U.S. hotels are located in suburban, interstate or small metro markets. As these destinations primarily appeal to domestic travelers, the vast majority of our portfolio is also not reliant on international travel. We lead the select-service space - 99% of our U.S. hotels are select-service. These hotels fare much better in turbulent times than the higher-end chainscales, as evidenced by second quarter RevPAR performance in 2020 where RevPAR in our economy and midscale portfolios declined 52% compared to 2019 while the upper upscale and luxury segments across the industry declined 87% compared to 2019. We have a proven track record of growing our unit base even during times of economic difficulty. We do this by focusing our efforts on conversion opportunities and by leveraging our strong value proposition. Our brands deliver significant value to hotel owners through a world-class distribution platform and an industry-leading loyalty program, proprietary revenue management tools, broad-scale marketing activities, lower commission and operating costs and a returns-based approach to owner investments. Our business model is a low capital intensive business with high operating leverage. With over 95% of our hotels franchised, we have limited exposure to operating costs and capital requirements associated with owned assets. We require less than $50 million in annual capital expenditure spend, and we have minimal to-no exposure to incentive fees. Our revenue and cash flows are highly predictable and reliable, as a result of our asset-light, feebased business model. We license our brands and associated trademarks to nearly 6,000 franchisees globally, which provides for a highly diversified owner base with limited concentration. Our franchisees range from sole proprietors to institutional investors such as public real estate investment trusts. Our franchise agreements are typically 10 to 20 years in length, providing significant visibility into future cash flows. Under these agreements, our franchisees generally pay us a ----- royalty fee of 4% to 5% of gross room revenue and a marketing and reservation fee of 3% to 5% of gross room revenue. We occasionally provide financial support in the form of loans or development advances to help generate new business. We have 362 hotels under management contracts and two owned hotels - the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa in Puerto Rico and the Wyndham Grand Orlando Bonnet Creek. We only manage properties under our brands, primarily under the Wyndham, Wyndham Grand, La Quinta, Dolce, Hawthorn and Ramada brands in major markets and resort destinations globally. The duration of our management agreements is typically 10 to 20 years. We earn a base management fee, which is based on a percentage of the hotel’s total revenue, and in some cases we earn an incentive fee, which is based on achieving performance metrics agreed upon with hotel owners. Under our management arrangements, we provide all the benefits of a franchising agreement and also conduct the day-to-day-operations of the hotel on behalf of the owner.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73
1614_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Recent Developments,9.2.1,Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business,"Our industry is experiencing a sharp decline in travel demand due to COVID-19 and the related government preventative and protective actions intended to slow the spread of the virus. While RevPAR has been steadily improving since April 2020, we and the entire industry are experiencing significant revenue losses as a result of steep RevPAR declines, which may continue for some time. We are committed to protecting the health of our communities and have been responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation by implementing a recovery plan focused on the health and safety of guests and employees and the implementation of cost saving and mitigating measures. _Prevention Measures_ As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19, we have taken the following preventative measures to conserve our liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet and support our franchisees through these unprecedented times: - Suspended our share repurchase program as of March 17, 2020; - Workforce reductions, including the elimination of 442 team members across the globe; - Advertising reductions; - Reduced our quarterly cash dividend per share to $0.08 per share from $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2020; - Capital expenditures reductions to focus on only the highest priority projects; - Elimination of all discretionary spend; - Temporary closure of our two owned hotels for April and May 2020; - Our Chief Executive Officer elected to forgo his base salary and our Board of Directors (""Board"") elected to forgo the cash portion of their fees for a portion of the year; and - Drew substantially all of our outstanding availability under our revolving credit facility in March 2020 to further increase our liquidity position. Additionally, in April 2020, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility agreement to provide for more flexibility. Our franchisees’ financial health and long-term success is a top priority for us, and we have taken the following proactive steps to help them preserve cash during this period: 2 ----- - Suspended non-room revenue related fees, such as Wyndham Rewards retraining fees; - Deferred property improvement plans and certain non-essential brand standards requiring cash outlays, such as hot breakfast requirements; - Partnered with industry associations to advocate for government relief for our franchisees and their employees; - Guided owners through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES"") and its evolving guidance and urged the government to expand and clarify these loan programs, for which the majority of our owners qualify; - Provided payment relief by deferring March, April and May receivables and suspending interest charges and late fees until September 1, 2020; and - Revised cleaning protocols and secured critical cleaning and disinfection supplies pursuant to new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (""CDC"") guidelines through our procurement network at reduced costs for our franchisees as well as funding and deferring repayment of these costs to help our franchisees conserve cash during this pandemic. - For our guests whose travel plans have changed, we have modified cancellation policies, paused Wyndham Rewards point expirations until September 30, 2020 and are maintaining loyalty member level status through the end of 2021. As a result of the above mentioned mitigation steps, we have reduced our expected cash outflows in 2020 by approximately $255 million, of which $155 million is expected to be volume-related reductions with the remaining $100 million representing expected savings from our restructuring actions that are permanent changes to our cost infrastructure. Of this $100 million, approximately $40 million is expected to drive incremental EBITDA on a continual basis in the future while approximately $60 million relates to our marketing, reservation and loyalty funds and will eventually be redeployed to variable, high-ROI marketing activities on an opportunistic basis as marketing, reservation and loyalty revenues recover in the future. For the three months ended June 30, 2020, we generated Adjusted EBITDA of $63 million.[ (1)] In addition, we used $85 million of cash during the three months ended June 30, 2020, including the effects of $67 million of deferred franchise fees in connection with our franchise relief measures and $28 million of transaction-related, separation-related and restructuring cash payments, all of which are currently expected to be one-time in nature. Excluding these one-time items, we generated $10 million in positive cash flow in the second quarter of 2020. (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. “Adjusted EBITDA” for us is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs, transaction-related items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), foreign currency impacts of highly inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance or financial position under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net revenues, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for its segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, allows a more complete understanding of its operating performance. We use these measures internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to make day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 3 ----- The reconciliation of Net (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

(b) Represents charges associated with restructuring initiatives implemented in response to the effects on travel demand as a result of COVID-19. (c) Primarily relates to integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of La Quinta. _Domestic Trends_ As of the date of this offering memorandum, over 99% of our 6,300 domestic hotels are open and our Company experienced as of the week ended August 1[st] its 16th consecutive week of an increase in occupancy. Since our recovery is less reliant on air travel or international travel demands and nearly 90% of our domestic hotels are located along highways and in suburban and small metro areas and our brands in the economy and midscale segments are utilized by the truckers, contractors, construction workers, healthcare workers, emergency crews and others who still need overnight accommodations even in this COVID-19 crisis, overall occupancy continues to show sequential improvement in our economy and mid-scale brands in the United States. Our July month-to-date occupancy averaged nearly 50% in the United States and recently reached a high point of 60% on August 1[st], reflecting strength in drive-to leisure destinations. As of August 1, 2020, nearly 70% of our US franchisees are operating above 40% occupancy, the level at which we estimate our franchisees to be breakeven after accounting for their operating expenses and debt service requirements. Our weekly U.S. RevPAR has steadily improved from (71%) in mid-April to (39%) in mid-July and the 35% of franchise fees that had been paid as of June 30[th] has already increased to over 40%. (a) Includes all WH brands. (b) Includes Industry averages for Upscale, Upper Upscale and Luxury segments, as defined by STR. In addition, as of August 1, 2020, direct channel web bookings have increased by approximately 80% since the April-May timeframe. Volume into our call centers is trending near pre-COVID levels, and loyalty member occupancy has increased by over 400 basis points year-to-date compared to 2019. 4 ----- _International Trends_ All of our international regions are experiencing occupancy improvement. As of the date of this offering memorandum, 93% of our system is open in Asia-Pacific and occupancy is over 60% in China. In Canada, 98% of our system is open and occupancy has reached over 50%. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where 71% of our system is open, occupancy has reached approximately 40%. Latin America remains our most challenged region with over 80 hotels still closed and occupancy levels at less than 30%. While we believe our hotels will be able to quickly recover once the pandemic abates, the ultimate timing of any recovery remains uncertain. In the meantime, our results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted and certain additional intangible assets, such as our trademarks, and our franchised and managed goodwill may be exposed to additional impairments. For further discussion on the effect of COVID-19 on our financial condition and liquidity, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry—The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 have disrupted the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, which have had and are expected to continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, which is incorporated by reference herein.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

For further discussion on Free Cash Flow, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” 6 “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs, transactionrelated items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), foreign currency impacts of highly 10 ----- inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for its segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, allows a more complete understanding of its operating performance. We use these measures internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to make day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP.

Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment charges of $205 million, in the second quarter of 2020, primarily related to certain trademarks and goodwill associated with its owned hotel reporting unit. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $4 million non-cash impairment charge for the write-off of a receivable associated with the expected termination of an unprofitable hotel-management agreement. The Company also recovered cash proceeds of $3 million of a previously impaired asset also in the second quarter of 2020.

(e) The Company incurred $16 million and $29 million of charges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, related to two restructuring initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19. The first quarter of 2020 plan resulted in a reduction of 262 employees for a charge of $13 million. The Company initiated another plan in the second quarter of 2020 to further reduce headcount by 180 employees and to consolidate its corporate facilities resulting in a charge of $16 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company had implemented restructuring initiatives, primarily focused on enhancing its organizational efficiency and rationalizing its operations. 12 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

1614_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry,13.1.1,"The effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) have disrupted the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, which have had and are expected to continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.","In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, in March 2020, it was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and, subsequently, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout the United States attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and State and local governments proceeded to implement shelterin-place orders and other restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 that currently remain in place. COVID-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the global economy and the hospitality industry due to these travel restrictions, resulting in cancelled and reduced travel and complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations and hotel closures for an indefinite period, including ongoing disruptions to the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, all of which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, including cash flow and liquidity, results of operations, outlook, plans, growth and stock price. While many states have begun phased re-openings, several states that began phased re-openings have re-implemented restrictions in response to a surge in COVID-19 cases. We expect that RevPAR declines may continue for some time. Significant risks include: - **Revenues and Expenses: Due to the spread of COVID-19, we have experienced significant decreases in demand and RevPAR. The negative effects of COVID-19 have and will continue to negatively impact our revenues and profitability and the amount of management and franchise fees revenues we are able to generate from our franchised and managed properties. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 is making it difficult for our franchisees and property owners to satisfy operating needs and could make it difficult for them to satisfy their debt obligations to us or others or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could generally impact their cost and our ability to increase revenue in the future. In addition, if a significant number of hotels exit our system as a result of COVID-19, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. COVID-19 could also materially impact other non-hotel related sources of revenues for us, including, for example, our fees from our co-branded credit card arrangement or our license fee revenues. We could be further required to test our intangible assets or goodwill for impairments due to reduced revenues or cash flows. - **Operations: Due to the significant decrease in travel demand, we have taken actions and continue to evaluate opportunities for managing our operating expenses and conserving our financial resources, including the actions described under See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Given the uncertainty relating to COVID-19, we may have to take additional actions in the future, which cannot be predicted. ----- - **Financial Condition and Indebtedness: In March 2020, we borrowed $734 million, representing substantially all of our outstanding availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We do not currently have additional borrowing capacity and our liquidity is limited to cash on hand. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2020, we amended our credit facility to, among other things, waive the quarterly-tested leverage ratio financial covenant until the second quarter of 2021 and tighten certain covenants, including with respect to share repurchases and certain investments. In addition, we are subject to a minimum liquidity covenant of $200 million, tested on a monthly basis, during such period, and must use the proceeds from certain asset sales and debt issuances to repay outstanding revolving loans during such period. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. An event of default enables our lenders to terminate their commitments and would trigger consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments. Additionally, any failure to meet required payments of principal and interest under our outstanding indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other indebtedness that contains cross-default provisions. - **Growth: Our plans for growth may be negatively impacted by COVID-19. This environment could result in difficulties for our franchisees and property owners to obtain financing on reasonable terms. In addition, our development pipeline is subject to a number of risks, including that developers are experiencing construction delays as a result of restrictions on business activity and supply chain interruptions which could cause delays in the completion and development of new hotels, impacting our net rooms growth and/or slowing the rate of our pipeline growth. - **Capital Markets Impact: The global stock markets have, and may continue to, experience volatility as a result of COVID-19. The price of our common stock has been volatile in recent months and has experienced periods of significant declines. The significant uncertainty created by the impact of COVID-19 has caused the global economy, business confidence and consumer confidence to have, and likely continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including on our common stock. In addition, we are restricted in our ability to repurchase shares and limited in our ability to make dividend payments. Despite the steps we have taken to assess and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, among other things: - the scope and duration of the pandemic, including any additional resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases, and its impact on our business operations, financial results, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity, as well as the impact on our franchisees and property owners and their operations, our guests and our team members, the hospitality industry and the overall demand for travel; - new information which may emerge concerning the severity and impact of COVID-19; - the actions necessary to contain COVID-19 or respond to its impact, including the need for us or our franchisees and property owners to quarantine team members, employees of our franchisees or our guests or impacted areas that may be affected; - the impact of the resurgence of the number of COVID-19 cases and the potential resulting re-implementation of restrictions and a renewed or greater unwillingness of guests to travel and stay in hotels due to actual or perceived risks of contracting COVID-19; - the timing and availability of vaccinations and other treatments for COVID-19; - general economic and competitive conditions; - the continuation or worsening of the effects from COVID-19; - the success of mitigation efforts in response to COVID-19 by our franchisees, property owners, and us, including the actions described under "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 ----- - actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, including stay-in-place directives and other travel restrictions and the success of those actions; - our performance in any recovery from COVID-19 or any resurgence; - our relationships with franchisees and property owners; - continued access to liquidity, capital and financing as a result of COVID-19 and the terms and cost thereof, as well as our credit rating; - potential exposure to additional impairments to certain intangible assets, such as our trademarks and our franchised and managed goodwill; - our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls since many team members are working remotely; - the diversion of management’s attention from the business if any key team member becomes ill from COVID19 or unable to work; - the size and length of the resulting unemployment rates and changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and confidence; - the ability of our franchisees and property owners to successfully respond to the adverse effects of the pandemic and our and their ability to comply with our respective agreements; - the potential of our franchisees and property owners to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate debt or foreclose on the property, which could result in the termination of our franchise or management agreements and impact our current earnings, future earnings and overall financial condition; - potential exposure to make payments to third-parties to whom we made financial guarantees; - the length of the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic abates, including the time it takes for demand and pricing to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume; - the impact on our contracts with our partners, including force majeure provisions; - labor markets and activities or additional demands or requests from labor unions or labor disputes or disruptions; - unexpected additional costs and expenses incurred by us, franchisees and property owners related to the effects of COVID-19 and steps taken to counteract future outbreaks, including enhanced health and hygiene or social distancing requirements; - the effects of any steps we take to reduce operating costs as a result of COVID-19, which may affect, among other things, our brand reputation, our ability to operate the company, our ability to attract and retain team members and guest experience and loyalty; and the effect of any steps we, franchisees and property owners take to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other pandemics and epidemics; and - potential exposure related to guests or team members who may contract COVID-19. The potential effects of COVID-19 cannot be predicted in terms of duration or impact and could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors identified below and in our “Risk Factors” section of Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

As of June 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had no indebtedness or other liabilities outstanding. Any such indebtedness or liabilities would have been structurally senior to the Notes because holders of the Notes will not have direct claims against such non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2020, we had (i) a term loan with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.6 billion maturing in 2025 (the “Term Loan Credit Facility) and (ii) a five-year revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), of which $734 million was outstanding and $15 million was allocated to outstanding letters of credit.

Additionally, our right to receive assets from any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries upon its bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, and the right of holders of the Notes to participate in those assets, is structurally subordinated to claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. If we incur any additional obligations that rank equally with the Notes, including trade payables, the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed to unsecured and senior creditors upon our insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up.

These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our flexibility to operate our business. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the indenture governing the Notes, the credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Existing Notes, or to maintain the financial ratios required by the Credit Facilities, could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness.

As of June 30, 2020, the pay-fixed/receive-variable interest rate swaps hedge $1.1 billion of the Company’s term loan interest rate exposure, of which $600 million expires in the second quarter of 2024 and has a weighted average fixed rate of 2.54% and $500 million expires in the fourth quarter of 2024 and has a weighted average fixed rate of 1.45%.

We do not intend to apply for the listing of the Notes on any securities exchange. We have been informed by the initial purchasers that they intend to make a market in the Notes after the offering is completed. However, the initial purchasers may cease their market-making at any time without notice. In addition, the liquidity of the trading market in the Notes, and the market price quoted for the Notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to limits imposed by the U.S. federal securities laws. As a result, an active trading market for the Notes may not develop or continue. If an active market does not develop or continue, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If a market for the Notes develops, it is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions and price volatility.

If such a voidance occurs, holders of the Notes might be required to return payments received from our Subsidiary Guarantors in the event of bankruptcy or other financial difficulty of our Subsidiary Guarantors. Under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws, a guarantee could be set aside if, among other things, a guarantor, at the time it incurred the debt evidenced by its guarantee: - incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the guarantee and (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence; (ii) was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which the assets remaining with it constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on such business; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts mature. The tests for fraudulent conveyance, including the criteria for insolvency, will vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied. Generally, however, a debtor would be considered insolvent if, at the time the debtor incurred the debt, either: - the sum of the debtor’s debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the debtor’s assets at fair valuation; ----- - the present fair saleable value of the debtor’s assets was less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on the debtor’s total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and matured; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We may also be required to offer to repurchase certain of our other debt upon a change of control or change of control triggering event, including our Existing Notes, and such event may also give rise to an event of default under the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our Existing Notes. In addition, agreements governing indebtedness incurred in the future may restrict us from repurchasing the Notes in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

Each guarantee will be limited as the issuer deems necessary to prevent such guarantee from being rendered voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Such limitations may not be successful. Each guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled to a contribution from each other guarantor in an amount equal to such other guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the guarantors at the time of such payment. If a guarantee were to be rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable guarantor and, depending on the amount of such Indebtedness, a guarantor’s liability on its guarantee could be reduced to zero. In addition, if, after the first original issue date of the notes, a Domestic Subsidiary enters into guarantees (such guarantee being referred to as the “Triggering Guarantee”) of Senior Indebtedness of the issuer under the Credit Agreement, then the issuer will, within 10 business days, cause such Domestic Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Domestic Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes on the same terms and conditions as the original guarantees from the initial guarantors with such limitations as are set forth in the Triggering Guarantee. A guarantor will be automatically released and relieved from all its obligations under its guarantee in the following circumstances: (a) upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of at least a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests in such guarantor (other than to the issuer or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries), as permitted under the indenture; (b) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such guarantor (other than to the issuer or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries), as permitted under the indenture; or (c) if at any time such guarantor no longer guarantees (or which guarantee is being simultaneously released or will be immediately released after the release of the guarantor) the Senior Indebtedness of the issuer under the Credit Agreement. “Senior Indebtedness” means, with respect to any Person, Indebtedness of such Person, whether outstanding on the date of the indenture or thereafter incurred unless, in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding, it is provided that such obligations are subordinate in right of payment to the notes; provided, however, that Senior Indebtedness shall not include (1) any Indebtedness of such Person owing to any Subsidiary of the issuer; or (2) any Indebtedness of such Person (and any accrued and unpaid interest in respect thereof) which is subordinate or junior in any respect to any other Indebtedness of such Person.

This means that in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our Subsidiaries that are not guarantors, the holders of notes will have no direct claim to participate in the assets of such Subsidiary but may only recover by virtue of our equity interest in our Subsidiaries (except to the extent we have a claim as a creditor of such Subsidiary). As a result, all existing and future liabilities of our Subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including trade payables and claims of lessors under leases, have the right to be satisfied in full prior to our receipt of any payment as an equity owner of our Subsidiaries.

The following terms have the following meanings for purposes of the section “Optional Redemption”. “Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (assuming that the notes matured on     , 2023) (“Remaining Life”) of the notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the Remaining Life. “Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or, if only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is obtained, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation. “Independent Investment Banker” means an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by us, which may be one of the Reference Treasury Dealers. “Reference Treasury Dealer” means any primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a “Primary Treasury Dealer”) that we select. “Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. “Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated “H.15(519)” or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption “Treasury Constant Maturities”, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), (2) if the period from the redemption date to     , 2023 of the notes to be redeemed is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used, or (3) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. We may at any time, and from time to time, purchase the notes at any price or prices in the open market or otherwise. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

In the Change of Control Offer, we will offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at our option, prior to the date of consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the pending Change of Control, we will mail (or deliver electronically) a notice to holders of notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. The repurchase obligation with respect to any notice delivered prior to the consummation of the Change of Control, shall be conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflicts. On the Change of Control Payment Date, we will, to the extent lawful: - accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; - deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and - deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted. The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered the purchase price for the notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any notes surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. We will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by us and such third party purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes accept a Change of Control Offer and the issuer purchases all of the notes held by such holders, the issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes that remain outstanding, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of holders, the following definitions are applicable: “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of us and our Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than us or one of our Subsidiaries; (2) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the issuer; or (3) any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting power of the voting stock of the issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a transaction will not be deemed to ----- involve a Change of Control solely as a result of the issuer becoming a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of a holding company if (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the issuer’s voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company and (b) the right to acquire voting stock (so long as such Person does not have the right to direct the voting of the voting stock subject to such right) or any veto power in connection with the acquisition or disposition of voting stock will not cause a party to be a beneficial owner. “Change of Control Triggering Event” means (x) a Change of Control that is accompanied or followed by a downgrade of the notes within the Ratings Decline Period by each of Moody’s and S&P (or, in the event S&P or Moody’s or both shall cease rating the notes (for reasons outside the control of the issuer) and the issuer shall select any other Rating Agency, the equivalent of such ratings by such other Rating Agency) and (y) the rating of the notes on any day during such Ratings Decline Period is below the lower of the rating by such Rating Agency in effect (i) immediately preceding the first public announcement of the Change of Control (or occurrence thereof if such Change of Control occurs prior to public announcement) and (ii) the date on which the notes are originally issued under the indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a downgrade will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a downgrade for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at our request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the reduction in rating). “Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., and its successors. “Rating Agency” means a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, as amended, selected by us (as certified by a resolution of our board of directors) as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P, or both, as the case may be. “Ratings Decline Period” means the period that (i) begins on the earlier of (a) the date of the first public announcement of the occurrence of a Change of Control or of the intention by the issuer or a shareholder of the issuer, as applicable, to effect a Change of Control or (b) the occurrence thereof and (ii) ends 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control; provided that such period shall be extended for so long as the rating of the notes, as noted by the applicable rating agency, is under publicly announced consideration for downgrade by the applicable rating agency. “S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and any successor to its rating agency business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

In the event that we consolidate or merge with another entity or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity, the surviving entity will be substituted for us under the indenture and may exercise our every right and power under the notes and the indenture, and we will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all of our obligations under the notes and the indenture. ----- Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether the merger, consolidation or sale of assets covenant would apply to a particular transaction as described above absent a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction. This covenant shall not apply to transactions by and among the issuer and its Subsidiaries unless the issuer elects to have the covenant apply. Notwithstanding the preceding, (i) we, directly or indirectly, may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to one or more of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge or amalgamate into an affiliate for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the issuer, reincorporating the issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the issuer. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. Any merger, consolidation or sale of our assets as described above might be deemed for United States federal income tax purposes to be an exchange of your notes for new notes, resulting in recognition of taxable gain or loss for those purposes, and possibly also adverse withholding or other tax consequences of holding or disposing of the notes thereafter.

_provided, further, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:_ (1) any Taxes that would have been imposed absent a Change in Domicile; (2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant beneficial owner, if the relevant beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including the beneficial owner being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than by the mere ownership or holding of such note or enforcement of rights thereunder or the receipt of payments in respect thereof; ----- (3) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the beneficial owner had made a declaration of non-residence or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that (x) such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold such Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required under the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant beneficial owner at that time has been notified (in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices”) by the issuer or any other person through whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required to be made);

If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment, then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto. (b) Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to Consolidated EBITDA with respect to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a Responsible Officer and include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run-rate” cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies projected by the issuer in good faith to be realizable as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating initiatives, operating changes and synergies had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating initiatives, operating changes and synergies were realized during the entirety of such period) and “run-rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public target’s compliance costs with public company requirements) net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions, in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in and consistent with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA.

Notwithstanding anything in this definition to the contrary, when calculating the Secured Leverage Ratio in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such ratio and of any default or event of default blocker shall, at the option of the issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such ratio shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such ratio shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided further, that if the issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition. “Qualified Securitization Financing” means any

In addition, the issuer and the guarantors have agreed that they will make available to the holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such holders, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

1614_1,Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.18,Events of Default,124.18.1,,"Holders of notes will have specified rights if an Event of Default (as defined below) occurs. The term “Event of Default” in respect of the notes means any of the following: - we do not pay interest, including any additional interest and any additional amounts, on any note within 30 days of its due date; - we do not pay the principal of or any premium on any note, including any additional amount, when due and payable, at maturity, or upon acceleration or redemption; - we remain in breach of a covenant or warranty in respect of the indenture or any note (other than a covenant included in the indenture solely for the benefit of debt securities of another series of notes) for 90 days after we receive a written notice of default, which notice must be sent by either the Trustee or holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding notes; - a default resulting in acceleration of Indebtedness of ours or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries other than intercompany Indebtedness of at least $75 million in aggregate principal amount, which acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled after 45 days’ notice thereof; - we or any of our significant subsidiaries file for bankruptcy, or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization specified in the indenture; or - a final judgment for the payment of $75 million or more (excluding any amounts covered by insurance or indemnities) rendered against us or any of our significant subsidiaries, which judgment is not discharged or stayed within 60 days after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such appeal has commenced, or (ii) the date on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished. If an Event of Default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the notes may, by written notice to the issuer (with a copy to the Trustee, if given by such holders), declare the entire unpaid principal amount of (and premium, if any), and all the accrued interest on, such notes to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. There is no action on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the notes required for such declaration if the Event of Default is the issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency ----- or reorganization. Holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes may also waive certain past defaults under the indenture with respect to the notes on behalf of all of the holders of the notes. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled, under specified circumstances, by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of notes and the Trustee. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to stay any cure period under the indenture in the event of litigation regarding whether a default or Event of Default has occurred. A notice of default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of default. Any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder to the issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the issuer with such other information as the issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provide to the Trustee evidence that the issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed until such time as the issuer provides the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied; provided that the issuer shall promptly deliver such Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee upon becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation (as evidenced by the delivery to the Trustee of the Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant) shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar direction shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility to us, any holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the indenture or any other agreement and can rely conclusively on the Officer’s Certificate delivered by the issuer and determinations made by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default or Event of Default unless a responsible officer of the Trustee has received, at the corporate trust office, written notification specifying such default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indenture will provide that, to the extent we elect, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to our failure to comply with our obligations as set forth under “—SEC Reports,” will after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the notes at a rate equal to: ----- - 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for each day during the 60-day period beginning on, and including, the occurrence of such an Event of Default during which such Event of Default is continuing; and - 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for each day during the 120-day period beginning on, and including, the 61st day following, and including, the occurrence of such an Event of Default during which such Event of Default is continuing; provided, however, that in no event shall additional interest accrue under the terms of the indenture at an annual rate in excess of 0.50% during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date which is six months after the last date of original issuance of the notes for any failure to timely file any document or report that we are required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable (after giving effect to all applicable grace periods thereunder and other than reports on Form 8-K). If we so elect, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest payable on the notes. On the 181st day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to the reporting obligations is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), the notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of the indenture described in this paragraph will not affect the rights of holders of the notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event we do not elect to pay the additional interest following an Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 180 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, we must notify all holders of the notes and the Trustee and paying agent of such election prior to the beginning of such 180-day period. Upon our failure to timely give such notice, the notes will be immediately subject to acceleration as provided above. Except in cases of default, where the Trustee has special duties, the Trustee is not required to take any action under the indenture at the request of holders unless the holders offer the Trustee protection from expenses and liability satisfactory to the Trustee. If an indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the Trustee. The Trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances specified in the indenture. No delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of the right, remedy or Event of Default. Before holders are allowed to bypass the Trustee and bring a lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce their rights or protect their interests relating to the notes, the following must occur: - such holders must give the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; - holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the notes must make a written request that the Trustee take action because of the default and must offer the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any losses, liabilities or expenses of taking that action; and - the Trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the notice and offer of indemnity. Holders are, however, entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on the notes on or after the due date.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

Such opinion of counsel, in the case of defeasance under clause (i) above, must refer to and be based upon a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable United States federal income tax law occurring after the date of the indenture. We may exercise our defeasance option with respect to debt securities notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.

If we exercise our covenant defeasance option, payment of such notes may not thereafter be accelerated by reference to any covenant from which we are released as described under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. However, if acceleration were to occur for other reasons, the realizable value at the acceleration date of the money and government obligations in the defeasance trust could be less than the principal and interest then due on such notes, in that the required deposit in the defeasance trust is based upon scheduled cash flows rather than market value, which will vary depending upon interest rates and other factors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

We expect that under procedures established by DTC: - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers; and - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global note). Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, a société anonyme, on behalf of the owners of such interests. Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global note directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S global note through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for Notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note. Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance Period, and to which global note the transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the indenture.

1614_1,Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.28,Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes,124.28.1,,"All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or the Trustee are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated Notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under the indenture. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be made by the Trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and ----- Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies will not cause the Notes to be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments.” Our position is binding on an investor unless such investor discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. However, our determination concerning the effect of these contingencies is inherently factual, and our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, an investor might be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes, and to treat any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary interest income, rather than capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments.” Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,73

A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such holder. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of such disposition, the United States Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a non-corporate United States Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income.

The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) may be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that such payee is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. We must report annually to the IRS and to a Non-United States Holder the amount of interest paid to the Non-United States Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to such interest. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. Unless the Non-United States Holder complies with certain certification procedures to establish that the Non-United States Holder is not a United States person, information returns may also be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note. The IRS may make this information available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-United States Holder is a resident. In addition, a Non-United States Holder may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to interest payments on a Note or the proceeds from disposition of a Note, unless, generally, the Non-United States Holder certifies under penalties of perjury (usually on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) that the Non-United States Holder is not a United States person or the Non-United States Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment of the Notes on or about , 2020, which will be the      business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the Notes hereunder may be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+     , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to the second business day immediately preceding their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,73
