commencing          , 2021. The Notes will mature on          , 2028.

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to          , 2023 at a redemption price equal to the greater of
(i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed; and (ii) the “make-whole” redemption price, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding
the date of redemption, as described under the section entitled “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, at any time prior to      , 2023,
the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price

of Control Triggering Event (as defined under the section “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders of Notes”) occurs, the Issuer will be
required to offer to repurchase the Notes from the holders at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

_references herein to “Wyndham Worldwide,” “Wyndham Destinations” and “former Parent” refer to Wyndham_

**Our Company**

We are the world’s largest hotel franchising company by number of hotels, with over 9,000 affiliated hotels
with 812,900 rooms located in approximately 90 countries and welcoming nearly 150 million guests annually
worldwide. Our 20 brands are primarily located in secondary and tertiary cities and approximately 80% of the U.S.
population lives within ten miles of at least one of our affiliated hotels. Our mission is to make hotel travel possible
for all. Wherever people go, Wyndham will be there to welcome them. We boast a remarkably asset-light business
model with only two of our over 9,000 hotels being owned, dramatically limiting our capital needs and our exposure
to real estate and the rising wage environment. In 2019, Wyndham Hotels generated net revenues of $2,053 million,
net income of $157 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $613 million.

Our business is fueled by leisure travelers, representing 70% of our bookings. We are not reliant on group
business. The other 30% of bookings is generated from contract business where travel is essential, such as
transportation, utility, logistics and infrastructure industries or essential front-line emergency, medical or
government workers. This business is predictable and dependable. Our portfolio of hotels is not reliant on air travel
rather it is predominately “drive to” - approximately 90% of our U.S. hotels are located in suburban, interstate or
small metro markets. As these destinations primarily appeal to domestic travelers, the vast majority of our portfolio
is also not reliant on international travel.

We lead the select-service space - 99% of our U.S. hotels are select-service. These hotels fare much better
in turbulent times than the higher-end chainscales, as evidenced by second quarter RevPAR performance in 2020
where RevPAR in our economy and midscale portfolios declined 52% compared to 2019 while the upper upscale
and luxury segments across the industry declined 87% compared to 2019. We have a proven track record of growing
our unit base even during times of economic difficulty. We do this by focusing our efforts on conversion
opportunities and by leveraging our strong value proposition. Our brands deliver significant value to hotel owners
through a world-class distribution platform and an industry-leading loyalty program, proprietary revenue
management tools, broad-scale marketing activities, lower commission and operating costs and a returns-based
approach to owner investments.

Our business model is a low capital intensive business with high operating leverage. With over 95% of our
hotels franchised, we have limited exposure to operating costs and capital requirements associated with owned
assets. We require less than $50 million in annual capital expenditure spend, and we have minimal to-no exposure to
incentive fees. Our revenue and cash flows are highly predictable and reliable, as a result of our asset-light, feebased business model.

We license our brands and associated trademarks to nearly 6,000 franchisees globally, which provides for a
highly diversified owner base with limited concentration. Our franchisees range from sole proprietors to institutional
investors such as public real estate investment trusts. Our franchise agreements are typically 10 to 20 years in length,
providing significant visibility into future cash flows. Under these agreements, our franchisees generally pay us a


-----

royalty fee of 4% to 5% of gross room revenue and a marketing and reservation fee of 3% to 5% of gross room
revenue. We occasionally provide financial support in the form of loans or development advances to help generate
new business.

We have 362 hotels under management contracts and two owned hotels - the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar
Beach Resort and Spa in Puerto Rico and the Wyndham Grand Orlando Bonnet Creek. We only manage properties
under our brands, primarily under the Wyndham, Wyndham Grand, La Quinta, Dolce, Hawthorn and Ramada
brands in major markets and resort destinations globally. The duration of our management agreements is typically
10 to 20 years. We earn a base management fee, which is based on a percentage of the hotel’s total revenue, and in
some cases we earn an incentive fee, which is based on achieving performance metrics agreed upon with hotel
owners. Under our management arrangements, we provide all the benefits of a franchising agreement and also
conduct the day-to-day-operations of the hotel on behalf of the owner.

**Recent Developments**

**_Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business_**

Our industry is experiencing a sharp decline in travel demand due to COVID-19 and the related
government preventative and protective actions intended to slow the spread of the virus. While RevPAR has been
steadily improving since April 2020, we and the entire industry are experiencing significant revenue losses as a
result of steep RevPAR declines, which may continue for some time. We are committed to protecting the health of
our communities and have been responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation by implementing a recovery plan
focused on the health and safety of guests and employees and the implementation of cost saving and mitigating
measures.

_Prevention Measures_

As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19, we have taken the following preventative measures to
conserve our liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet and support our franchisees through these unprecedented times:

    - Suspended our share repurchase program as of March 17, 2020;

    - Workforce reductions, including the elimination of 442 team members across the globe;

    - Advertising reductions;

    - Reduced our quarterly cash dividend per share to $0.08 per share from $0.32 per share in the first
quarter of 2020;

    - Capital expenditures reductions to focus on only the highest priority projects;

    - Elimination of all discretionary spend;

    - Temporary closure of our two owned hotels for April and May 2020;

    - Our Chief Executive Officer elected to forgo his base salary and our Board of Directors ("Board")
elected to forgo the cash portion of their fees for a portion of the year; and

    - Drew substantially all of our outstanding availability under our revolving credit facility in March 2020
to further increase our liquidity position. Additionally, in April 2020, we completed an amendment to
our revolving credit facility agreement to provide for more flexibility.

Our franchisees’ financial health and long-term success is a top priority for us, and we have taken the
following proactive steps to help them preserve cash during this period:

2


-----

    - Suspended non-room revenue related fees, such as Wyndham Rewards retraining fees;

    - Deferred property improvement plans and certain non-essential brand standards requiring cash outlays,
such as hot breakfast requirements;

    - Partnered with industry associations to advocate for government relief for our franchisees and their
employees;

    - Guided owners through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES") and its
evolving guidance and urged the government to expand and clarify these loan programs, for which the
majority of our owners qualify;

    - Provided payment relief by deferring March, April and May receivables and suspending interest
charges and late fees until September 1, 2020; and

    - Revised cleaning protocols and secured critical cleaning and disinfection supplies pursuant to new U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") guidelines through our procurement network at
reduced costs for our franchisees as well as funding and deferring repayment of these costs to help our
franchisees conserve cash during this pandemic.

    - For our guests whose travel plans have changed, we have modified cancellation policies, paused
Wyndham Rewards point expirations until September 30, 2020 and are maintaining loyalty member
level status through the end of 2021.

As a result of the above mentioned mitigation steps, we have reduced our expected cash outflows in 2020
by approximately $255 million, of which $155 million is expected to be volume-related reductions with the
remaining $100 million representing expected savings from our restructuring actions that are permanent changes to
our cost infrastructure. Of this $100 million, approximately $40 million is expected to drive incremental EBITDA
on a continual basis in the future while approximately $60 million relates to our marketing, reservation and loyalty
funds and will eventually be redeployed to variable, high-ROI marketing activities on an opportunistic basis as
marketing, reservation and loyalty revenues recover in the future. For the three months ended June 30, 2020, we
generated Adjusted EBITDA of $63 million.[ (1)] In addition, we used $85 million of cash during the three months
ended June 30, 2020, including the effects of $67 million of deferred franchise fees in connection with our franchise
relief measures and $28 million of transaction-related, separation-related and restructuring cash payments, all of
which are currently expected to be one-time in nature. Excluding these one-time items, we generated $10 million
in positive cash flow in the second quarter of 2020.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is not required by, or presented in
accordance with, GAAP. “Adjusted EBITDA” for us is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest expense,
depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs,
transaction-related items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), foreign currency impacts of highly
inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is not a
measurement of our financial performance or financial position under GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to net revenues, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We
believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for its segments which, when considered with
GAAP measures, allows a more complete understanding of its operating performance. We use these measures
internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to make
day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA
is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or other
measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA .................................... $ 63

(a) Represents a non-cash charge to reduce the carrying values of certain
intangible assets to their fair values principally attributable to higher discount
rates primarily resulting from increased share price volatility, partially offset by
$3 million of cash proceeds from a previously impaired asset.

(b) Represents charges associated with restructuring initiatives implemented in
response to the effects on travel demand as a result of COVID-19.

(c) Primarily relates to integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition
of La Quinta.

_Domestic Trends_

As of the date of this offering memorandum, over 99% of our 6,300 domestic hotels are open and our
Company experienced as of the week ended August 1[st] its 16th consecutive week of an increase in occupancy.

Since our recovery is less reliant on air travel or international travel demands and nearly 90% of our
domestic hotels are located along highways and in suburban and small metro areas and our brands in the economy
and midscale segments are utilized by the truckers, contractors, construction workers, healthcare workers,
emergency crews and others who still need overnight accommodations even in this COVID-19 crisis, overall
occupancy continues to show sequential improvement in our economy and mid-scale brands in the United States.
Our July month-to-date occupancy averaged nearly 50% in the United States and recently reached a high point of
60% on August 1[st], reflecting strength in drive-to leisure destinations. As of August 1, 2020, nearly 70% of our US
franchisees are operating above 40% occupancy, the level at which we estimate our franchisees to be breakeven
after accounting for their operating expenses and debt service requirements. Our weekly U.S. RevPAR has steadily
improved from (71%) in mid-April to (39%) in mid-July and the 35% of franchise fees that had been paid as of June
30[th] has already increased to over 40%.

(a) Includes all WH brands.
(b) Includes Industry averages for Upscale, Upper Upscale and Luxury segments, as defined by STR.

In addition, as of August 1, 2020, direct channel web bookings have increased by approximately 80% since
the April-May timeframe. Volume into our call centers is trending near pre-COVID levels, and loyalty member
occupancy has increased by over 400 basis points year-to-date compared to 2019.

-----

_International Trends_

All of our international regions are experiencing occupancy improvement. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, 93% of our system is open in Asia-Pacific and occupancy is over 60% in China. In Canada, 98% of
our system is open and occupancy has reached over 50%. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where 71%
of our system is open, occupancy has reached approximately 40%. Latin America remains our most challenged
region with over 80 hotels still closed and occupancy levels at less than 30%.

While we believe our hotels will be able to quickly recover once the pandemic abates, the ultimate timing
of any recovery remains uncertain. In the meantime, our results of operations may continue to be negatively
impacted and certain additional intangible assets, such as our trademarks, and our franchised and managed goodwill
may be exposed to additional impairments. For further discussion on the effect of COVID-19 on our financial
condition and liquidity, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry—The effects of the
outbreak of COVID-19 have disrupted the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, which have had
and are expected to continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and stock price” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2020, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Maturity ........................................ The Notes will mature on            , 2028.

Interest Payment Dates ................. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on         and

of each year, beginning on            , 2021.

obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors, and will rank equally

the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Credit Facilities and
the Existing Notes, and senior in right of payment to any existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The
Notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to any secured indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally
subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and
other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

As of June 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom, the Issuer would have had $852 million of unsecured indebtedness
outstanding (including finance leases) and $2,847 million of total indebtedness
outstanding, and approximately $351 million of available borrowing capacity
under the Revolving Credit Facility, all of which would have been secured if
borrowed.

offer to repurchase the Notes from the holders at a price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid

will develop or as to the liquidity of any market that may develop. The initial
purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the
Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and any market making with
respect to the Notes may be discontinued without notice.

management agreements, or are Company-owned and (ii) properties under affiliation agreements for which
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts receives a fee for reservation and/or other services provided.

3 Represents revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying the average occupancy rate by the
average daily rate.

4 Represents the average royalty rate earned on our franchised properties and is calculated by dividing total
royalties, excluding the impact of amortization of development advance notes, by total room revenues.

5 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Results
include $35 million and $195 million of payments to tax authorities related to the La Quinta acquisition
during 2018 and 2019, respectively, as well as $98 million, $113 million and $48 million of transactionrelated, separation-related, contract termination and restructuring cash outlays during 2018, 2019 and 2020,
respectively. “Free Cash Flow” is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with
GAAP. For further discussion on Free Cash Flow, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

6 “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest expense, depreciation and
amortization, impairment charges, restructuring and related charges, contract termination costs, transactionrelated items (acquisition-, disposition- or separation-related), foreign currency impacts of highly

inflationary countries, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes. We believe that adjusted
EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for its segments which, when considered with GAAP
measures, allows a more complete understanding of its operating performance. We use these measures
internally to assess operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and to
make day to day operating decisions, including in the evaluation of selected compensation decisions.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to
net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with
GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by
other companies. For further discussion on Adjusted EBITDA, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” For
a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which we believe is the most closely comparable
GAAP financial measure, see the table in footnote 10 below.

(a) As a result of COVID-19 and the significant negative impact it has had on travel demand, the Company
reviewed its intangible assets for potential impairment and determined that the carrying value of certain
intangible assets were in excess of their fair values. Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment
charges of $205 million, in the second quarter of 2020, primarily related to certain trademarks and goodwill
associated with its owned hotel reporting unit. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, the Company
incurred a $4 million non-cash impairment charge for the write-off of a receivable associated with the
expected termination of an unprofitable hotel-management agreement. The Company also recovered cash
proceeds of $3 million of a previously impaired asset also in the second quarter of 2020. Represents $45

million of non-cash net impairment charges associated with the termination of an unprofitable hotelmanagement guarantee arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2019. Represents $41 million of noncash impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $25 million was for a writedown of a guarantee asset and a development advance note receivable related to a hotel-management
guarantee arrangement and $16 million was primarily related to a partial write-down of management
agreement assets

(b) Represents separation-related costs associated with our spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide Corporation
for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(c) Primarily relates to integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of La Quinta.

(d) Represents the one-time fee credit related to our agreement with CorePoint Lodging, which is reflected as a
reduction to hotel management revenues on the income statement.

(e) The Company incurred $16 million and $29 million of charges during the three and six months ended June
30, 2020, respectively, related to two restructuring initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19. The
first quarter of 2020 plan resulted in a reduction of 262 employees for a charge of $13 million. The
Company initiated another plan in the second quarter of 2020 to further reduce headcount by 180
employees and to consolidate its corporate facilities resulting in a charge of $16 million. In addition, during
the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company had implemented restructuring initiatives, primarily focused on
enhancing its organizational efficiency and rationalizing its operations.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the Notes involves risks. Please see the risk factors set forth below and in our Annual Report Form 10-K_
_for the year ended December 31, 2019, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and_
_documents subsequently filed with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference herein. You should carefully consider each_
_of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this offering memorandum or incorporated by_
_reference herein, including the “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and_
_our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, before investing in the Notes. Based on the_
_information currently known to us, we believe that the risk factors set forth herein and those incorporated by reference in this_
_offering memorandum identify the most significant risk factors affecting our company. However, the risks and uncertainties_
_we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below or incorporated by reference herein. Additional_
_risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our_
_business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends_
_should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods._

_If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, you could lose all or a portion of_
_your investment in the Notes._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry**

**_The effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) have disrupted the operations of our franchisees,_**
**_property owners and us, which have had and are expected to continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and stock price._**

In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, in March 2020, it was recognized as a pandemic by the
World Health Organization and, subsequently, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency throughout
the United States attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and State and local governments proceeded to implement shelterin-place orders and other restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 that currently remain in place. COVID-19 continues
to have an unprecedented impact on the global economy and the hospitality industry due to these travel restrictions, resulting
in cancelled and reduced travel and complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations and hotel closures for an indefinite
period, including ongoing disruptions to the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, all of which has had, and
is expected to continue to have, a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, including cash flow and
liquidity, results of operations, outlook, plans, growth and stock price. While many states have begun phased re-openings,
several states that began phased re-openings have re-implemented restrictions in response to a surge in COVID-19 cases. We
expect that RevPAR declines may continue for some time.

Significant risks include:

    - **Revenues and Expenses: Due to the spread of COVID-19, we have experienced significant decreases in**
demand and RevPAR. The negative effects of COVID-19 have and will continue to negatively impact our
revenues and profitability and the amount of management and franchise fees revenues we are able to generate
from our franchised and managed properties. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 is making it difficult for our
franchisees and property owners to satisfy operating needs and could make it difficult for them to satisfy their
debt obligations to us or others or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could generally impact
their cost and our ability to increase revenue in the future. In addition, if a significant number of hotels exit our
system as a result of COVID-19, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. COVID-19 could also
materially impact other non-hotel related sources of revenues for us, including, for example, our fees from our
co-branded credit card arrangement or our license fee revenues. We could be further required to test our
intangible assets or goodwill for impairments due to reduced revenues or cash flows.

    - **Operations: Due to the significant decrease in travel demand, we have taken actions and continue to evaluate**
opportunities for managing our operating expenses and conserving our financial resources, including the actions
described under See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Given the uncertainty relating to
COVID-19, we may have to take additional actions in the future, which cannot be predicted.


-----

    - **Financial Condition and Indebtedness: In March 2020, we borrowed $734 million, representing substantially**
all of our outstanding availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We do not currently have additional
borrowing capacity and our liquidity is limited to cash on hand. We intend to use the proceeds from this
offering to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2020,
we amended our credit facility to, among other things, waive the quarterly-tested leverage ratio financial
covenant until the second quarter of 2021 and tighten certain covenants, including with respect to share
repurchases and certain investments. In addition, we are subject to a minimum liquidity covenant of $200
million, tested on a monthly basis, during such period, and must use the proceeds from certain asset sales and
debt issuances to repay outstanding revolving loans during such period. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources" in our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. An event of default enables our lenders to terminate
their commitments and would trigger consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments.
Additionally, any failure to meet required payments of principal and interest under our outstanding indebtedness
could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other indebtedness that contains
cross-default provisions.

    - **Growth: Our plans for growth may be negatively impacted by COVID-19. This environment could result in**
difficulties for our franchisees and property owners to obtain financing on reasonable terms. In addition, our
development pipeline is subject to a number of risks, including that developers are experiencing construction
delays as a result of restrictions on business activity and supply chain interruptions which could cause delays in
the completion and development of new hotels, impacting our net rooms growth and/or slowing the rate of our
pipeline growth.

    - **Capital Markets Impact: The global stock markets have, and may continue to, experience volatility as a result**
of COVID-19. The price of our common stock has been volatile in recent months and has experienced periods
of significant declines. The significant uncertainty created by the impact of COVID-19 has caused the global
economy, business confidence and consumer confidence to have, and likely continue to have, a significant
effect on the market price of securities generally, including on our common stock. In addition, we are restricted
in our ability to repurchase shares and limited in our ability to make dividend payments.

Despite the steps we have taken to assess and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, the extent to which
COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including, among other things:

    - the scope and duration of the pandemic, including any additional resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases,
and its impact on our business operations, financial results, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity, as
well as the impact on our franchisees and property owners and their operations, our guests and our team
members, the hospitality industry and the overall demand for travel;

    - new information which may emerge concerning the severity and impact of COVID-19;

    - the actions necessary to contain COVID-19 or respond to its impact, including the need for us or our franchisees
and property owners to quarantine team members, employees of our franchisees or our guests or impacted areas
that may be affected;

    - the impact of the resurgence of the number of COVID-19 cases and the potential resulting re-implementation of
restrictions and a renewed or greater unwillingness of guests to travel and stay in hotels due to actual or
perceived risks of contracting COVID-19;

    - the timing and availability of vaccinations and other treatments for COVID-19;

    - general economic and competitive conditions;

    - the continuation or worsening of the effects from COVID-19;

    - the success of mitigation efforts in response to COVID-19 by our franchisees, property owners, and us,
including the actions described under " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020


-----

    - actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, including stay-in-place
directives and other travel restrictions and the success of those actions;

    - our performance in any recovery from COVID-19 or any resurgence;

    - our relationships with franchisees and property owners;

    - continued access to liquidity, capital and financing as a result of COVID-19 and the terms and cost thereof, as
well as our credit rating;

    - potential exposure to additional impairments to certain intangible assets, such as our trademarks and our
franchised and managed goodwill;

    - our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls since many team members are
working remotely;

    - the diversion of management’s attention from the business if any key team member becomes ill from COVID19 or unable to work;

    - the size and length of the resulting unemployment rates and changes in consumer preferences, discretionary
spending and confidence;

    - the ability of our franchisees and property owners to successfully respond to the adverse effects of the pandemic
and our and their ability to comply with our respective agreements;

    - the potential of our franchisees and property owners to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a
default, accelerate debt or foreclose on the property, which could result in the termination of our franchise or
management agreements and impact our current earnings, future earnings and overall financial condition;

    - potential exposure to make payments to third-parties to whom we made financial guarantees;

    - the length of the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic abates, including the time it takes for demand
and pricing to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume;

    - the impact on our contracts with our partners, including force majeure provisions;

    - labor markets and activities or additional demands or requests from labor unions or labor disputes or
disruptions;

    - unexpected additional costs and expenses incurred by us, franchisees and property owners related to the effects
of COVID-19 and steps taken to counteract future outbreaks, including enhanced health and hygiene or social
distancing requirements;

    - the effects of any steps we take to reduce operating costs as a result of COVID-19, which may affect, among
other things, our brand reputation, our ability to operate the company, our ability to attract and retain team
members and guest experience and loyalty; and the effect of any steps we, franchisees and property owners take
to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other pandemics and epidemics; and

    - potential exposure related to guests or team members who may contract COVID-19.

The potential effects of COVID-19 cannot be predicted in terms of duration or impact and could intensify or otherwise
affect many of our other risk factors identified below and in our “Risk Factors” section of Annual Report Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2019 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and in our
subsequent filings with the SEC.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Indebtedness**

**_The Notes are subject to prior claims of our secured creditors and the creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and if a_**
**_default occurs we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes are our senior general obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with our other senior indebtedness
and liabilities but effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness and structurally subordinated to the debt and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of June 30,
2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had no indebtedness or other liabilities outstanding. Any such indebtedness or liabilities
would have been structurally senior to the Notes because holders of the Notes will not have direct claims against such
non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2020, we had (i) a term loan with an aggregate principal amount of approximately
$1.6 billion maturing in 2025 (the “Term Loan Credit Facility) and (ii) a five-year revolving credit facility maturing in 2023
with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Credit
Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), of which $734 million was outstanding and $15 million was allocated to outstanding letters
of credit. The indenture will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional secured debt under specified circumstances. If
we incur any secured debt, our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries securing such debt will be subject to prior claims by
our secured creditors. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, assets that secure debt
will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full. Holders of
the Notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all of our unsecured and senior creditors, including our trade
creditors. Additionally, our right to receive assets from any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries upon its bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization, and the right of holders of the Notes to participate in those assets, is structurally subordinated to claims of
that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors.

If we incur any additional obligations that rank equally with the Notes, including trade payables, the holders of those
obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed to unsecured and senior
creditors upon our insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up. This may have the effect of
reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If there are not sufficient assets remaining to pay all of these creditors, all or a
portion of the Notes then outstanding would remain unpaid.

**_The indenture will not limit the amount of unsecured indebtedness that we and our subsidiaries may incur._**

The indenture under which the Notes will be issued will not limit the amount of unsecured indebtedness that we and
our subsidiaries may incur. In addition, the indenture will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness under specified
circumstances. The indenture will not contain any financial covenants or other provisions that would afford the holders of the
Notes any substantial protection in the event we participate in a highly leveraged transaction.

**_Restrictions imposed by the indenture governing the Notes and the agreements governing our other outstanding_**
**_indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, may limit our ability to operate our business and to_**
**_finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. If we fail to comply with certain_**
**_restrictions under our Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing Notes and the indenture governing the_**
**_Notes, our debt could be accelerated and we may not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated debt._**

The indenture governing the Notes will contain and the agreements governing our other outstanding indebtedness,
including the credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Existing Notes, contain
various covenants that may limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:

      - create liens on certain assets;

      - incur additional debt;

      - make certain investments and acquisitions;

      - consolidate, merge, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

      - sell certain assets;

      - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

      - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and


-----

      - place restrictions on distributions from and other actions by subsidiaries.

These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions.

As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and may be
unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions
may limit our flexibility to operate our business. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the indenture
governing the Notes, the credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Existing Notes, or to
maintain the financial ratios required by the Credit Facilities, could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of the indebtedness. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable us to comply with the covenants
in the indentures governing the Notes or the Existing Notes or the credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities or our
other indebtedness, or to remedy any resulting default. In addition, in the event of acceleration, we may not have or be able to
obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments, including those under the Notes. The covenants under the
indenture will be subject to a number of significant exceptions. See “Description of Notes.”

**_Our indebtedness exposes us to interest expense increases if interest rates increase._**

A portion of the Term Loan Facility is exposed to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to interest rate risk. As of
June 30, 2020, the pay-fixed/receive-variable interest rate swaps hedge $1.1 billion of the Company’s term loan interest rate
exposure, of which $600 million expires in the second quarter of 2024 and has a weighted average fixed rate of 2.54% and
$500 million expires in the fourth quarter of 2024 and has a weighted average fixed rate of 1.45%. The variable rates of the
swap agreements are based on one-month LIBOR. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate
indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income would decrease.
As of June 30, 2020, an increase of 0.125% in the interest rates payable on the variable rate indebtedness would increase our
annual estimated debt-service requirements by $1.5 million.

**_No active trading market may develop for the Notes._**

Prior to this offering, there has been no trading market for the Notes. We do not intend to apply for the listing of the
Notes on any securities exchange. We have been informed by the initial purchasers that they intend to make a market in the
Notes after the offering is completed. However, the initial purchasers may cease their market-making at any time without
notice. In addition, the liquidity of the trading market in the Notes, and the market price quoted for the Notes, may be
adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or
prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. In addition, such market-making activities will be
subject to limits imposed by the U.S. federal securities laws. As a result, an active trading market for the Notes may not
develop or continue. If an active market does not develop or continue, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be
adversely affected. If a market for the Notes develops, it is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to
disruptions and price volatility. Any disruptions may have a negative effect on holders of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance.

**_We will not register the Notes or exchange the Notes in a registered exchange offer, which could significantly impair the_**
**_liquidity of the Notes and limit your access to information about us._**

We will not register the Notes under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other place. Absent registration,
the Notes may be offered or sold only in transactions that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. and applicable state securities laws, and you may be
required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

We do not intend to offer to exchange the Notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act.
Accordingly, this offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were registering
the offering of the Notes with the SEC.

**_Changes in the ratings of the Notes, our credit ratings or the debt markets could adversely affect the price of the Notes._**

The price for the Notes depends on many factors, including:

      - our credit ratings with major credit rating agencies;


-----

      - the prevailing interest rates being paid by, or the market price for the Notes issued by, other companies similar
to us;

      - our financial condition, financial performance and future prospects; and

      - the overall condition of the financial markets.

The financial markets and prevailing interest rates are likely to fluctuate in the future. Such fluctuations could have
an adverse effect on the price of the Notes.

Credit rating agencies continually review their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. The credit
rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit rating for us based on their overall view of
our industry. Rating organizations may lower their respective ratings of the Notes or decide not to continue to rate the Notes
in their sole discretion. The reduction, suspension or withdrawal of the ratings of the Notes will not constitute an event of
default under the indenture. However, any reduction, suspension or withdrawal of these ratings may adversely affect the
market price or liquidity of the Notes.

**_If we file a bankruptcy petition, or if a bankruptcy petition is filed against us, you may receive a lesser amount for your_**
**_claim under the Notes than you would have been entitled to receive under the indenture._**

If we file a bankruptcy petition under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the Notes, or if such a
bankruptcy petition is filed against us, your claim against us for the principal amount of your Notes may be limited to an
amount equal to:

      - the original issue price for the Notes; and

      - the portion of original issue discount that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for purposes of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.

Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of any bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you may receive a lesser amount than you would have been
entitled to receive under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, even if sufficient funds are available.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may permit courts to void the Subsidiary_** **_Guarantors’ guarantees of the Notes in specific_**
**_circumstances, which would interfere with any payment under the Subsidiary_** **_Guarantors’ guarantees._**

Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances described below, to void the Subsidiary
Guarantors’ guarantees of the Notes. If such a voidance occurs, holders of the Notes might be required to return payments
received from our Subsidiary Guarantors in the event of bankruptcy or other financial difficulty of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
Under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws, a guarantee could be set
aside if, among other things, a guarantor, at the time it incurred the debt evidenced by its guarantee:

      - incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors; or

      - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the guarantee and (i) was
insolvent or was rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence; (ii) was engaged, or about to engage, in a
business or transaction for which the assets remaining with it constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on
such business; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those
debts mature.

The tests for fraudulent conveyance, including the criteria for insolvency, will vary depending upon the law of the
jurisdiction that is being applied. Generally, however, a debtor would be considered insolvent if, at the time the debtor
incurred the debt, either:

      - the sum of the debtor’s debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the debtor’s assets
at fair valuation;


-----

      - the present fair saleable value of the debtor’s assets was less than the amount required to pay the probable
liability on the debtor’s total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became
absolute and matured; or

      - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a court voids guarantees or holds them unenforceable, you will
cease to be a creditor of the subsidiary guarantor and will be a creditor solely of us.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event._**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the “Description of Notes”) occurs, unless we have exercised
our right to redeem the Notes, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes from holders in cash at a
redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on the Notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. However, we may not be able to repurchase the
Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because we may not have sufficient funds to do so. We may also be
required to offer to repurchase certain of our other debt upon a change of control or change of control triggering event,
including our Existing Notes, and such event may also give rise to an event of default under the Credit Facilities and the
indenture governing our Existing Notes. In addition, agreements governing indebtedness incurred in the future may restrict us
from repurchasing the Notes in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event. Any failure to repurchase properly
tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture, which could, in turn, cause an acceleration of our
other indebtedness. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders of Notes.” Certain mergers or
consolidations will not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event and will not require us to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes. In addition, we have the ability to reincorporate in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. without any
requirement to pay additional amounts to holders of the Notes in respect of withholding taxes. See “Description of Notes—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby, after deducting the initial purchasers’
discounts and other estimated offering fees and expenses payable by us, will be approximately $       million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding
under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses.

Certain of the initial purchasers, or an affiliate or affiliates thereof, are or may be lenders and/or agents under the
Credit Facilities and such initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering in
connection with the repayment of a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

The     % notes due 2028 (the “notes”) will be issued by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. under the
indenture (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through the date hereof, the “base indenture”), dated as of April
13, 2018, by and between Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”), and a supplemental indenture thereto, to be dated as of the closing date of this offering (the “supplemental
indenture” and, together with the base indenture, the “indenture”), by and among Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., the
guarantors party thereto and the Trustee. In this Description of Notes, “we”, “us”, “our” and the “issuer” refer to Wyndham
Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and its successors only and not to any of its subsidiaries.

Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the notes and the indenture. This summary is
subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the notes and the indenture, including definitions
of certain terms used therein. You may obtain copies of the notes and the indenture by requesting them from us or the
Trustee.

**General**

The notes:

      - will be our senior unsecured obligations;

      - will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior Indebtedness from time to time outstanding,
including obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes;

      - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors
including claims with respect to trade payables;

      - will be effectively subordinated to all our existing and future secured obligations, including our obligations
under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations;

      - will initially be limited to $350.0 million aggregate principal amount; and

      - will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The guarantees:

      - will be the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor;

      - will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ other senior Indebtedness from time to time
outstanding, including obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes; and

      - will be effectively subordinated to all of the guarantors’ existing and future secured obligations, including the
guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
obligations.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The notes will bear interest at the rate of     % per year. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on

and       of each year, beginning on      , 2021, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
of twelve 30-day months. Interest on the notes will accrue from and including the settlement date and will be paid to holders
of record on the       or       immediately before the respective interest payment date.

The notes will mature on      , 2028, at which time the holders of notes will be entitled to receive 100%
of the outstanding principal amount of the notes. The notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund.

If any interest payment date falls on a day that is not a business day, then payment of interest may be made on the
next succeeding business day and no interest will accrue because of such delayed payment. With respect to the notes, when


-----

we use the term “business day” we mean any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the
applicable place of payment are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.

**Guarantees**

The notes will be guaranteed on a full and unconditional senior unsecured basis initially by each of our subsidiaries
that guarantees our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes.

The guarantors will fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment of all of the principal of, and any premium and
interest on, the notes when due, whether at maturity or otherwise. Each guarantee will be limited as the issuer deems
necessary to prevent such guarantee from being rendered voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Such limitations may not be successful.

Each guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled to a contribution from each other guarantor
in an amount equal to such other guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the
guarantors at the time of such payment. If a guarantee were to be rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all
other Indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable guarantor and, depending on the
amount of such Indebtedness, a guarantor’s liability on its guarantee could be reduced to zero.

In addition, if, after the first original issue date of the notes, a Domestic Subsidiary enters into guarantees (such
guarantee being referred to as the “Triggering Guarantee”) of Senior Indebtedness of the issuer under the Credit Agreement,
then the issuer will, within 10 business days, cause such Domestic Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Domestic Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes on the same terms
and conditions as the original guarantees from the initial guarantors with such limitations as are set forth in the Triggering
Guarantee.

A guarantor will be automatically released and relieved from all its obligations under its guarantee in the following
circumstances:

(a) upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, of at least a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other
interests in such guarantor (other than to the issuer or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries), as permitted under
the indenture;

(b) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such guarantor (other than to the issuer or
any of its Domestic Subsidiaries), as permitted under the indenture; or

(c) if at any time such guarantor no longer guarantees (or which guarantee is being simultaneously released or
will be immediately released after the release of the guarantor) the Senior Indebtedness of the issuer under
the Credit Agreement.

“Senior Indebtedness” means, with respect to any Person, Indebtedness of such Person, whether outstanding on the
date of the indenture or thereafter incurred unless, in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the
same is outstanding, it is provided that such obligations are subordinate in right of payment to the notes; provided, however,
that Senior Indebtedness shall not include (1) any Indebtedness of such Person owing to any Subsidiary of the issuer; or
(2) any Indebtedness of such Person (and any accrued and unpaid interest in respect thereof) which is subordinate or junior in
any respect to any other Indebtedness of such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, the indenture will not treat (1) unsecured
Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as
subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with
respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.

**Ranking**

The notes will be our general unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future
unsubordinated obligations.

Holders of any secured Indebtedness will have claims that are prior to your claims as holders of the notes, to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness, in the event of any bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding.
The indenture will provide that our obligations under the Credit Agreement shall, with respect to the assets of the issuer and


-----

its subsidiaries that constitute or purport to constitute collateral thereunder, be treated for all purposes as secured by such
assets including in any insolvency proceeding, with the obligations under the notes treated for all purposes as not secured
thereby, and the secured parties under the Credit Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this provision.

We conduct our operations through our Subsidiaries. As a result, distributions or advances from our Subsidiaries are
a major source of funds necessary to meet our debt service and other obligations. Contractual provisions, laws or regulations,
as well as our Subsidiaries’ financial condition and operating requirements, may limit our ability to obtain cash required to
pay our debt service obligations, including payments on the notes. The notes will be “structurally” subordinated to all
obligations of our Subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including claims with respect to trade payables. This means that in the
event of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our Subsidiaries that are not guarantors, the holders of notes will
have no direct claim to participate in the assets of such Subsidiary but may only recover by virtue of our equity interest in our
Subsidiaries (except to the extent we have a claim as a creditor of such Subsidiary). As a result, all existing and future
liabilities of our Subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including trade payables and claims of lessors under leases, have the
right to be satisfied in full prior to our receipt of any payment as an equity owner of our Subsidiaries.

As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds
therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have had no indebtedness or other liabilities outstanding. Any such
indebtedness or other liabilities would have been structurally senior to the notes because holders of the notes will not have
direct claims against such non-guarantors. In addition, the notes will be “effectively” subordinated to all of our secured
obligations, including our obligations under the Credit Agreement. This means that in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization, our secured creditors will have priority over the holders of notes to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such secured obligations. As of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the notes offered hereby and the
use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately $1,561 million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the
Term Loan Credit Facility and approximately $384 million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, excluding $15 million allocated to letters of credit, all of which would have been effectively senior to the notes, as
described under “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

**Further Issues**

The indenture will provide that we may issue additional debt securities thereunder from time to time in one or more
series, and permits us to establish the terms of each series of debt securities at the time of issuance. The indenture does not
limit the aggregate amount of debt securities that may be issued under the indenture.

Under the indenture, we may, from time to time, without the consent of the holders of the notes, issue notes having
the same terms in all respects as the notes originally issued (other than the issuance date, the issuance price and, if applicable,
the amount and date of the first payment of interest) (the “additional notes”); provided that if the additional notes are not
fungible with the notes for United States federal income tax purposes, the additional notes will have a separate CUSIP
number.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to      , 2023, we may, at our option, at any time and from time to time, redeem all or
any portion of the notes on not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed (or, in the case of global notes,
delivered electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC) to registered holders of the notes to be redeemed at a
redemption price equal to the greater of:

      - 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date; and

      - the sum, as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, of the present value of the redemption price of
the notes at    , 2023 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing below) plus the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption)
discounted to    , 2023 on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months) at the Treasury Rate plus       basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption.

At any time and from time to time on or after      , 2023, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part, at
our option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed (or, in the case of global notes, delivered
electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC) to registered holders of the notes to be redeemed at a redemption
price equal the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes


-----

redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Price**

2023 ..................................................................................................................... %

2024 ..................................................................................................................... %

2025 and thereafter .............................................................................................. 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to         , 2023, we may redeem notes with the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to     % plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not
to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (including additional notes); provided that

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering, and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the
indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (including notes that are being called for redemption but
excluding notes held by the issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all such notes are redeemed
substantially concurrently.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at our option, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent (including, but not limited to, completion of an equity offering, other offering, issuance of indebtedness or other
transaction or event), and may include multiple amounts of notes that may be redeemed and the conditions precedent
applicable to such amounts. Such notice shall state that, in the issuer’s discretion, that the redemption date may be delayed
until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was delivered) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the issuer in its sole
discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. Notice of any redemption in respect thereof may be
given prior to the completion thereof and may be partial as a result of only some of the conditions being satisfied. In addition,
the issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid on the redemption date to the Person in whose name the note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose notes will be subject to
redemption by the issuer.

Unless the issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**No Sinking Fund**

The issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
notes. However, under certain circumstances, the issuer may be required to offer to purchase notes as described under the
caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders of Notes”. The issuer may at any time, and from time to time, purchase
notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If we elect to redeem fewer than all of the notes, and such notes are at the time represented by a global note, then the
depositary will select the particular notes to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC, or if no procedures are
prescribed by DTC, by lot. If we elect to redeem less than all of the notes, and any of such notes are not represented by a
global note, then the Trustee will select the particular notes to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or in a manner it deems
appropriate and fair (and the depositary will select by lot the particular interests in any global note to be redeemed), subject to
adjustments so that no note in an unauthorized denomination is redeemed in part; provided, however, that no note of $2,000
in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed in part.


-----

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more than
60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed at the address of such holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance
of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the
holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on
such note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms
of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), notes called for redemption become due on
the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption
price, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any
conditions contained in the applicable redemption notice. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all of the notes
(or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Trustee or paying agent on or before the
redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after such redemption date, interest will cease to
accrue on such notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption.

The following terms have the following meanings for purposes of the section “Optional Redemption”.

“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment
Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (assuming that the notes matured on     , 2023)
(“Remaining Life”) of the notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with
customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the Remaining Life.

“Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury
Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations,
the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or, if only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is
obtained, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.

“Independent Investment Banker” means an independent investment banking institution of national standing
appointed by us, which may be one of the Reference Treasury Dealers.

“Reference Treasury Dealer” means any primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a “Primary
Treasury Dealer”) that we select.

“Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption
date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable
Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent
Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding
such redemption date.

“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the
average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated
“H.15(519)” or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under
the caption “Treasury Constant Maturities”, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity
is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding
to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such
yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), (2) if the period from the redemption date to     ,
2023 of the notes to be redeemed is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury
securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used, or (3) if such release (or any successor release) is not
published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the
semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable
Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such
redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.

We may at any time, and from time to time, purchase the notes at any price or prices in the open market or
otherwise.


-----

**Repurchase at the Option of the Holders of Notes**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes as described
above, holders of notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000 in excess thereof) of their notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms
set forth in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, we will offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased to, but excluding,
the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”).

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at our option, prior to the date of
consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the pending Change of Control, we will mail (or
deliver electronically) a notice to holders of notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be
no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered (the “Change of Control Payment
Date”), pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. The repurchase obligation with
respect to any notice delivered prior to the consummation of the Change of Control, shall be conditioned on the Change of
Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions
of the indenture, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
our obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflicts.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, we will, to the extent lawful:

      - accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

      - deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or
portions of notes properly tendered; and

      - deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted.

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered the purchase price for the notes, and
the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any notes surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal
amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

We will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a
third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer
made by us and such third party purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

In the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes accept a
Change of Control Offer and the issuer purchases all of the notes held by such holders, the issuer will have the right, upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption
price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and
unpaid interest on the notes that remain outstanding, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption
date).

For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of holders, the following definitions are
applicable:

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of us and our Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any “person” (as
that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than us or one of our Subsidiaries; (2) the adoption
of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the issuer; or (3) any “person” (as that term is used in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the
voting power of the voting stock of the issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a transaction will not be deemed to


-----

involve a Change of Control solely as a result of the issuer becoming a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of a holding company if (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately
following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the issuer’s voting stock immediately prior to
that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying
the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting
stock of such holding company and (b) the right to acquire voting stock (so long as such Person does not have the
right to direct the voting of the voting stock subject to such right) or any veto power in connection with the
acquisition or disposition of voting stock will not cause a party to be a beneficial owner.

“Change of Control Triggering Event” means (x) a Change of Control that is accompanied or followed by a
downgrade of the notes within the Ratings Decline Period by each of Moody’s and S&P (or, in the event S&P or
Moody’s or both shall cease rating the notes (for reasons outside the control of the issuer) and the issuer shall select
any other Rating Agency, the equivalent of such ratings by such other Rating Agency) and (y) the rating of the notes
on any day during such Ratings Decline Period is below the lower of the rating by such Rating Agency in effect
(i) immediately preceding the first public announcement of the Change of Control (or occurrence thereof if such
Change of Control occurs prior to public announcement) and (ii) the date on which the notes are originally issued
under the indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a downgrade will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of
a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a downgrade for purposes of the definition of Change
of Control Triggering Event) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating do not announce or publicly
confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at our request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any
event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control
(whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the reduction in rating).

“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., and its successors.

“Rating Agency” means a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of
Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, as amended, selected by us (as certified by a resolution of our board of
directors) as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P, or both, as the case may be.

“Ratings Decline Period” means the period that (i) begins on the earlier of (a) the date of the first public
announcement of the occurrence of a Change of Control or of the intention by the issuer or a shareholder of the
issuer, as applicable, to effect a Change of Control or (b) the occurrence thereof and (ii) ends 60 days following
consummation of such Change of Control; provided that such period shall be extended for so long as the rating of
the notes, as noted by the applicable rating agency, is under publicly announced consideration for downgrade by the
applicable rating agency.

“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and any successor to its rating agency business.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

Under the terms of the indenture, we will be permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity or to sell all or
substantially all of our assets to another entity, subject to our meeting all of the following conditions:

      - the resulting, surviving or transferee entity (if other than us) must expressly assume through a supplemental
indenture our obligations under the indenture;

      - immediately following the consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, no Event of Default (as defined below)
shall have occurred and be continuing; and

      - the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is a corporation or other entity organized and validly existing under
the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction thereof, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the United Kingdom or
any country that is a member country of the European Union on the Issue Date, and in each case any
jurisdiction, state or subdivision of the foregoing.

In the event that we consolidate or merge with another entity or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another
entity, the surviving entity will be substituted for us under the indenture and may exercise our every right and power under
the notes and the indenture, and we will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all of our
obligations under the notes and the indenture.


-----

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether the merger, consolidation or sale of assets covenant would apply to a particular
transaction as described above absent a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction. This covenant shall not apply to
transactions by and among the issuer and its Subsidiaries unless the issuer elects to have the covenant apply.

Notwithstanding the preceding, (i) we, directly or indirectly, may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to one or more of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the issuer may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge or amalgamate into an affiliate for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the issuer,
reincorporating the issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Any merger, consolidation or sale of our assets as described above might be deemed for United States federal
income tax purposes to be an exchange of your notes for new notes, resulting in recognition of taxable gain or loss for those
purposes, and possibly also adverse withholding or other tax consequences of holding or disposing of the notes thereafter.
You should consult your tax adviser regarding the United States federal, state, local, and if applicable, non-United States,
income and other tax consequences of such an event.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by the issuer, including any successor thereto, on the notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
(“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If, as discussed in “—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” as a result of or following a merger or consolidation of the issuer with, or a sale by the
issuer of all or substantially all of its assets to, an entity that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United
States (a “Change in Domicile”), any deduction or withholding is at any time required for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction (other than the United States) from or through which the issuer makes (or, as a
result of the issuer’s connection with such jurisdiction, is deemed to make) a payment or delivery on the notes, or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States) in which the issuer is organized or otherwise
considered to be a resident or doing business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”);

in respect of any payment or delivery on the notes, then we will pay (together with such payment or delivery) such additional
amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payment
or delivery by each beneficial owner of such notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amount that would have been received in respect of such
payment or delivery in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that Additional Amounts shall be
payable only to the extent necessary so that the net amount received by the holder, after taking into account such withholding
or deduction, equals the amount that would have been received by the holder in the absence of a Change in Domicile;
_provided, further, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:_

(1) any Taxes that would have been imposed absent a Change in Domicile;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant beneficial owner, if the relevant beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including the beneficial owner being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in,
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than by the mere ownership or holding of such note or enforcement of rights
thereunder or the receipt of payments in respect thereof;


-----

(3) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the beneficial owner had made a declaration of
non-residence or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that (x) such declaration of
non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold such Taxes and (y) at least
30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or
filing for exemption is required under the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant beneficial
owner at that time has been notified (in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices”) by the issuer or any
other person through whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for
exemption is required to be made);

(4) any note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the beneficial owner (except to the extent that the beneficial
owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the note been presented during such 30 day period);

(5) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment or delivery on the
notes;

(6) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(7) any Taxes that could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of the
relevant note to another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;

(8) any Taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, as of the date of the indenture (or any amended or successor version that is substantively
comparable and not materially more onerous) and any regulations promulgated thereunder or official governmental
interpretations thereof (collectively, “FATCA”), to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed but for
the failure by a holder of notes to (i) comply with applicable reporting and other requirements under FATCA and/or
(ii) provide, upon reasonable demand by the paying agent, and at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, any
form, document or certification required under FATCA, which, if provided, would establish that the payments are
exempt from withholding under FATCA;

(9) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld
but for the beneficial owner being a bank (i) purchasing the notes in the ordinary course of its lending business or
(ii) that is neither (A) buying the notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the notes for resale to a thirdparty that either is not a bank or holding the notes for investment purposes only;

(10) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a
change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after
the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; or

(11) in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10).

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the note been the holder of the
note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (11) inclusive
above.

The issuer will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and to the extent received will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
certified copies to holders. The issuer will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding
Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of notes then
outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Copies of such
documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the trustee by the holders of the
notes upon request and will be made available at the offices of the paying agent.

At least 15 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the notes is due and payable
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 15th day prior to such date, in which case


-----

it shall be promptly thereafter), if the issuer will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the
issuer will deliver to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the
amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the trustee to pay such Additional Amounts
to holders on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s
Certificate addressing such matters.

Wherever in the indenture, the notes or this description of notes there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal,

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that,
in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the indenture and will apply
mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the issuer is organized or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Limitations on Liens**

The issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, incur, assume or enter
into a guarantee (collectively “incur”) of, any Indebtedness secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the
issuer’s or any of the issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries’ capital stock or assets, unless the issuer secures the notes equally and
ratably with the Indebtedness secured by such Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) for so long (i) as such Indebtedness is so
secured (any such Lien created shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Lien to which it relates or such Lien constituting a Permitted Lien), or (ii) the Restricted Subsidiary is no
longer a Subsidiary of the issuer (any such Lien created shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at
such time as when such Restricted Subsidiary is no longer a Subsidiary of the Company). The restrictions do not apply to
Indebtedness that is secured by the following Liens (the “Permitted Liens”):

      - Liens securing Indebtedness in aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of (x) the greater of (i)
$2,350 million and (ii) 49% of Total Assets at the time of incurrence plus (y) the maximum principal amount of
additional Indebtedness that could be incurred such that after giving effect to such incurrence, the Secured
Leverage Ratio would be no greater than 4.5 to 1.0, in each case outstanding at any one time;

      - Liens existing on the date the notes are first issued;

      - Liens existing on property or assets at the time of its acquisition or existing on the property or assets of any
Person at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary, in each case after the date hereof and any modifications,
replacements, refinancings, restructurings, renewals or extensions thereof; provided that (i) such Lien was not
created in contemplation of such acquisition or such Person becoming a Subsidiary, and (ii) such Lien does not
extend to or cover any other assets or property (other than the proceeds or products thereof and after-acquired
property subjected to a Lien pursuant to terms existing at the time of such acquisition, it being understood that
such requirement shall not be permitted to apply to any property to which such requirement would not have
applied but for such acquisition);

      - Liens in favor of the issuer or a Subsidiary of the issuer;

      - Liens on property or assets acquired after the date on which the notes are first issued which secure Indebtedness
incurred to acquire such property or assets or improve such property or assets, so long as (x) such Indebtedness
is incurred on the date of acquisition of such property or assets or within 180 days of the acquisition of such
property or assets; (y) such Indebtedness is in an amount no greater than the purchase price or improvement


-----

price, as the case may be, of such property or assets so acquired; and (z) such Liens do not extend to or cover
any property or assets of ours or any Restricted Subsidiary other than the property or assets so acquired;

- Liens for Taxes, assessments or governmental charges which are not overdue for a period of more than sixty
(60) days or, if more than sixty (60) days overdue which are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
actions diligently conducted;

- statutory and common law Liens of landlords, carriers, warehousemen, mechanics, materialmen, repairmen,
construction contractors or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business which secure amounts not
overdue for a period of more than sixty (60) days or, if more than sixty (60) days overdue such Lien is being
contested in good faith and by appropriate actions diligently conducted;

- Liens arising in the ordinary course of business in connection with workers’ compensation, unemployment
insurance and other social security legislation;

- Liens arising in the ordinary course of business securing insurance premiums or reimbursement or indemnity
obligations under insurance policies, in each case payable to insurance carriers that provide insurance to the
issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (iii) obligations in respect of letters of credit or bank guarantees
that have been posted by the issuer or the guarantors or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to support the
payments of the items set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this clause;

- Liens arising to secure (i) the performance of bids, trade contracts, governmental contracts and leases (other
than Indebtedness for borrowed money), statutory obligations, surety, stay, customs and appeal bonds,
performance bonds, performance and completion guarantees and other obligations of a like nature (including
those to secure health, safety and environmental obligations) incurred in the ordinary course of business and
(ii) obligations in respect of letters of credit or bank guarantees that have been posted to support payment of the
items set forth in clause (i) of this clause;

- easements, rights-of-way, land use regulations, covenants, conditions, restrictions (including zoning
restrictions), encroachments, protrusions and other similar encumbrances and minor title defects or matters that
would be disclosed in an accurate survey affecting real property which, in the aggregate, do not in any case
materially and adversely interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of the issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole);

- Liens securing judgments not constituting an Event of Default;

- (i) leases, licenses, subleases or sublicenses granted to other Persons in the ordinary course of business which
do not (A) interfere in any material respect with the business of the issuer or (B) secure any Indebtedness for
borrowed money or (ii) the rights reserved or vested in any Person by the terms of any lease, license, franchise,
grant or permit held by the issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or by a statutory provision, to terminate
any such lease, license, franchise, grant or permit, or to require annual or periodic payments as a condition to
the continuance thereof;

- Liens in favor of customs and revenue authorities arising as a matter of law to secure payment of customs duties
in connection with the importation of goods in the ordinary course of business;

- Liens (i) of a collection bank arising under Section 4-210 of the Uniform Commercial Code on items in the
course of collection, (ii) in favor of a banking institution arising as a matter of law or by operation of customary
standard terms and conditions of the account keeping bank encumbering deposits (including the right of set-off)
and which are within the general parameters customary in the banking industry, and (iii) encumbering
reasonable customary initial deposits and margin deposits and similar Liens attaching to commodity trading
accounts or other brokerage accounts incurred in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative

portion of such Lien in any manner that complies with this definition and such Permitted Lien shall be treated as having been
made pursuant only to the clause or clauses of the definition of Permitted Lien to which such Lien has been classified or
reclassified. Liens securing Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the date the Credit Agreement is
executed will be deemed to be incurred on such date in reliance on the exception described in the first bullet point under the
first paragraph of the covenant set forth under the caption “—Limitations on Liens.” The numerical amounts above are to be
measured at incurrence only.

In addition, the issuer may treat any amount of future Indebtedness as outstanding Indebtedness secured by a Lien
for purposes of the calculation of Secured Leverage Ratio calculation and may then later incur a Lien with respect to such
amount of Indebtedness without complying with the foregoing covenant.

**Limitations on Sale and Leaseback Transactions**

The issuer will not and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into any arrangement with any Person to
lease a Principal Property (except for any arrangements that exist on the date the notes are issued or that exist at the time any
Person that owns a Principal Property becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) which has been or is to be sold by us or the
Restricted Subsidiary to such Person unless:

      - the sale and leaseback arrangement involves a lease for a term of not more than three years;

      - the sale and leaseback arrangement is entered into between us and any Subsidiary or between our Subsidiaries;

      - we or the Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Principal
Property at least equal in amount to the Attributable Indebtedness permitted pursuant to “—Exemption from
Limitations on Liens and Limitations on Sale and Leaseback Transactions” without having to secure equally
and ratably the notes;

      - the proceeds of the sale and leaseback arrangement are at least equal to the fair market value (as determined by
our board of directors in good faith) of the Principal Property and we apply within 180 days after the sale an
amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or the Attributable Indebtedness associated with the
Principal Property to (i) the retirement of long-term debt for borrowed money that is not subordinated to the
notes and that is not debt to us or a Subsidiary, or (ii) the purchase or development of other comparable
property; or

      - the sale and leaseback arrangement is entered into within 180 days after the initial acquisition of the Principal
Property subject to the sale and leaseback arrangement.

Notwithstanding the limitations described under the covenants “Limitations on liens” and “Limitations on sale and
leaseback transactions” above, the issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to create or assume Liens to secure
Indebtedness or enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to Principal Property that would not otherwise be
permitted under the limitations described under “—Limitations on Liens” and “—Limitations on Sale and Leaseback
Transactions”, provided that the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness secured by such Liens (excluding Indebtedness and
related Liens otherwise permitted under the exceptions described in the bullet points under “—Limitations on Liens”) and the
Attributable Indebtedness with respect to all such sale and leaseback transactions (excluding Attributable Indebtedness with
respect to such sale and leaseback transactions entered into in reliance on the exceptions described in the bullet points under
“—Limitations on Sale and Leaseback Transactions”) at any time outstanding does not exceed the greater of (i) $440 million


-----

and (ii) 10% of Total Assets, measured at the date of incurrence (provided that any fees and expenses (including any
premium and defeasance costs) incurred in connection with the replacement, refinancing, restructuring, extension or renewal
pursuant to this paragraph of Indebtedness originally incurred pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to constitute
Indebtedness for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this
paragraph upon such replacement, refinancing, restructuring, extension or renewal).

“Pro Forma Basis” and “Pro Forma Effect” means whenever a financial ratio or test is to be calculated on a pro
forma basis, the reference to the “Test Period” for purposes of calculating such financial ratio or test shall be deemed to be a
reference to, and shall be based on, the most recently ended Test Period for which internal financial statements of the issuer
are available (as determined in good faith by the issuer).

(a) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio or test, transactions that have been made (i) during
the applicable Test Period and subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for
which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such
Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial
definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the applicable
Test Period. If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required
adjustment, then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto.

(b) Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to Consolidated EBITDA with respect to a Specified
Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a Responsible Officer and include, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run-rate” cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies projected by
the issuer in good faith to be realizable as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be
taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating
initiatives, operating changes and synergies had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost
savings, operating expense reductions, operating initiatives, operating changes and synergies were realized during
the entirety of such period) and “run-rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any
action taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the
elimination of a public target’s compliance costs with public company requirements) net of the amount of actual
benefits realized during such period from such actions, in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in and
consistent with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA.

(c) In the event that the issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or
guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness
included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test (in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid
under any revolving credit facility), (i) during the applicable Test Period subsequent to the end of the applicable Test
Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such
financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to
the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period.

Notwithstanding anything in this definition to the contrary, when calculating the Secured Leverage Ratio in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such ratio and of any default or event of
default blocker shall, at the option of the issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition
are entered into and such ratio shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition
Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, (x) if any of such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in
Consolidated EBITDA of the issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such ratio shall not be tested at the
time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided further, that if the issuer elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions shall be deemed
to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any
ratios under the indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition.

“Qualified Securitization Financing” means any Securitization Financing of a Securitization Entity that meets the
following conditions: (a) the issuer shall have determined in good faith that such Securitization Financing (including
financing terms, covenants, termination events and other provisions) is in the aggregate economically fair and reasonable to
the issuer, and its Restricted Subsidiaries party to the Securitization Financing, (b) all sales and/or contributions of
Securitization Assets and related assets to the Securitization Entity are made at fair market value or otherwise on terms that
are commercially fair and reasonable (in each case as determined in good faith by the issuer), and (c) the Securitization
Financing shall be non-recourse (except for Standard Securitization Undertakings) to the issuer and its Restricted

determined in good faith by the issuer).

most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal consolidated

forma adjustments set forth in the definition of Pro Forma Basis.

“Securitization Assets” means any present or future receivables and royalties, franchise, management and other fees

Subsidiaries) or (b) any Person other than the issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of a transfer by a Securitization
Entity).

“Short Derivative Instrument” means a Derivative Instrument (i) the value of which generally decreases, and/or the

“Specified Transaction” means any Investment, Disposition, incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness that requires
such test to be calculated on a “Pro Forma Basis” or after giving “Pro Forma Effect”; provided, that any such Specified
Transaction (other than a Restricted Payment) having an aggregate value of less than $10,000,000 may, at the issuer’s option,
not be calculated on a “Pro Forma Basis” or after giving “Pro Forma Effect”.


-----

**SEC Reports**

The indenture will provide that (i) any documents or reports that we are required to file with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act must be filed by us with the Trustee within 15 days after the same are required to be
filed with the SEC (giving effect to any grace period provided by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) whether or
not we are subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we will, within 30 days after each of the respective dates by
which we would have been required to file annual reports or quarterly reports if we were so subject, furnish to the Trustee
(a) all financial statements that would be required to be contained in an annual report on Form 10-K, or any successor or
comparable form, filed with the SEC, a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

(b) after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, all financial statements that would be required to
be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC. Substantially
concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant to clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the issuer shall also post copies of such information required by clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the issuer or a third party)
to which access will be given to holders.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the issuer or any parent entity of the issuer has furnished
to the holders of the notes and the Trustee or filed with the SEC the reports described above with respect to the issuer or any
parent entity of the issuer, the issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements set forth in the paragraph
above; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to any parent entity of the issuer, the same is


-----

accompanied by consolidating information, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating
to such parent entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the issuer on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For
the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

In addition, the issuer and the guarantors have agreed that they will make available to the holders and to prospective
investors, upon the request of such holders, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act so long as the notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. For purposes of this covenant, the
issuer and the guarantors will be deemed to have furnished the reports to the Trustee and the holders of notes as required by
this covenant if it has filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system or such reports are publicly available.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, if not filed with the SEC but made publicly available to the Trustee and
the registered holders of the notes in the event that the issuer or the parent is not subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, (a) such information will not be required to comply with Section 302 or Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC and (b) such
information will not be required to contain the separate financial information for Guarantors as contemplated by Rule 3-10 of

Regulation S-X or any financial statements of unconsolidated Subsidiaries or 50% or less owned persons as contemplated by
Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, or in each case any successor provisions.

The Trustee will have no responsibility to determine whether the filing of such financial statements has occurred.
Delivery of such reports, information, and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the indenture (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to rely on officer’s certificates).

**Events of Default**

Holders of notes will have specified rights if an Event of Default (as defined below) occurs. The term “Event of
Default” in respect of the notes means any of the following:

      - we do not pay interest, including any additional interest and any additional amounts, on any note within 30 days
of its due date;

      - we do not pay the principal of or any premium on any note, including any additional amount, when due and
payable, at maturity, or upon acceleration or redemption;

      - we remain in breach of a covenant or warranty in respect of the indenture or any note (other than a covenant
included in the indenture solely for the benefit of debt securities of another series of notes) for 90 days after we
receive a written notice of default, which notice must be sent by either the Trustee or holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding notes;

      - a default resulting in acceleration of Indebtedness of ours or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries other than
intercompany Indebtedness of at least $75 million in aggregate principal amount, which acceleration has not
been rescinded or annulled after 45 days’ notice thereof;

      - we or any of our significant subsidiaries file for bankruptcy, or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization specified in the indenture; or

      - a final judgment for the payment of $75 million or more (excluding any amounts covered by insurance or
indemnities) rendered against us or any of our significant subsidiaries, which judgment is not discharged or
stayed within 60 days after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such appeal has
commenced, or (ii) the date on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished.

If an Event of Default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least
30% in principal amount of the notes may, by written notice to the issuer (with a copy to the Trustee, if given by such
holders), declare the entire unpaid principal amount of (and premium, if any), and all the accrued interest on, such notes to be
due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. There is no action on the part of the
Trustee or any holder of the notes required for such declaration if the Event of Default is the issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency


-----

or reorganization. Holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes may also waive certain past defaults under the
indenture with respect to the notes on behalf of all of the holders of the notes. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may
be canceled, under specified circumstances, by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of notes and the Trustee.
A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to stay any cure period under the indenture in the event of litigation
regarding whether a default or Event of Default has occurred. A notice of default may not be given with respect to any action
taken, and reported publicly to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of default.

Any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (each, a “Directing
Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder to the issuer and the Trustee that such holder
is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that
are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice
of default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to
provide the issuer with such other information as the issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification
Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant
required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be
entitled to rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the issuer determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position
Representation and provide to the Trustee evidence that the issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction
seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to
invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such
default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted
and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter.
If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the issuer provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to
such default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed until such time as the issuer provides
the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied; provided that the issuer shall
promptly deliver such Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee upon becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been
satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation (as evidenced by the delivery to the Trustee of the Officer’s Certificate
stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant) shall result in such holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of notes held by the
remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder
Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never
to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any
notice of such default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the
Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar direction shall not require compliance
with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered
to it in accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position
Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate
delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net
Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability or
responsibility to us, any holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or
not any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the indenture or any
other agreement and can rely conclusively on the Officer’s Certificate delivered by the issuer and determinations made by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default or Event of Default unless a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received, at the corporate trust office, written notification specifying such default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indenture will provide that, to the extent we elect, the sole remedy for an Event of
Default relating to our failure to comply with our obligations as set forth under “—SEC Reports,” will after the occurrence of
such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the notes at a rate equal to:


-----

      - 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for each day during the 60-day period
beginning on, and including, the occurrence of such an Event of Default during which such Event of Default is
continuing; and

      - 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for each day during the 120-day period
beginning on, and including, the 61st day following, and including, the occurrence of such an Event of Default
during which such Event of Default is continuing;

provided, however, that in no event shall additional interest accrue under the terms of the indenture at an annual rate in excess
of 0.50% during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date which is six months after the last date of original
issuance of the notes for any failure to timely file any document or report that we are required to file with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable (after giving effect to all applicable grace periods thereunder and other
than reports on Form 8-K).

If we so elect, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest
payable on the notes. On the 181st day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to the reporting obligations
is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), the notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of
the indenture described in this paragraph will not affect the rights of holders of the notes in the event of the occurrence of any
other Event of Default. In the event we do not elect to pay the additional interest following an Event of Default in accordance
with this paragraph, the notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.

In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 180 days after the occurrence of an
Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations in accordance with the immediately
preceding paragraph, we must notify all holders of the notes and the Trustee and paying agent of such election prior to the
beginning of such 180-day period. Upon our failure to timely give such notice, the notes will be immediately subject to
acceleration as provided above.

Except in cases of default, where the Trustee has special duties, the Trustee is not required to take any action under
the indenture at the request of holders unless the holders offer the Trustee protection from expenses and liability satisfactory
to the Trustee. If an indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy
available to the Trustee. The Trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances specified in the indenture.
No delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of the right, remedy or Event of Default.

Before holders are allowed to bypass the Trustee and bring a lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps
to enforce their rights or protect their interests relating to the notes, the following must occur:

      - such holders must give the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured;

      - holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the notes must make a written request that the Trustee take action
because of the default and must offer the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any losses,
liabilities or expenses of taking that action; and

      - the Trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the notice and offer of indemnity.

Holders are, however, entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on the notes on or after
the due date.

**Modification of the Indenture**

The indenture will provide that we and the Trustee may, without the consent of any holders of the notes, amend the
notes and the indenture for the purposes, among other things, of:

      - curing ambiguities, omissions, mistakes, defects or inconsistencies;

      - providing for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the issuer under the indenture or
the notes;

      - adding guarantees with respect to the notes;


-----

      - securing the notes or confirming and evidencing the release, termination, discharging or retaking of any
guarantee or Lien with respect to securing the notes when such release, termination or discharge is provided for
under the indenture or the notes or any applicable collateral document;

      - adding to the covenants of the issuer for the benefit of some or all of the holders or surrendering any right or
power conferred upon the issuer;

      - adding additional events of default;

      - making any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any holder under the
indenture;

      - changing or eliminating any provisions of the indenture so long as there are no holders entitled to the benefit of
the provisions;

      - complying with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the indenture under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended;

      - conforming the provisions of the indenture and the notes to the “Description of Notes” section in this offering
memorandum;

      - supplementing any of the provisions of the indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate
the defeasance and discharge of the notes so long as any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of
any holder of the notes;

      - permitting the authentication and delivery of additional notes;

      - providing for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes subject to applicable laws;

      - evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or paying agent;

      - complying with obligations under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

      - evidencing the release of any guarantor pursuant to the terms of the indenture; or

      - making any amendment to the provisions of the indenture or the notes to eliminate the effect of any Accounting
Change or in the application thereof as described in the last paragraph of the definition of “GAAP.”.

With specific exceptions, the indenture or the rights of the holders of notes may be modified by us and the Trustee
with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of notes, but no modification may be made
without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note that would:

      - extend the maturity of any payment of principal of or any installment of interest on the notes;

      - reduce the principal amount of any note, or the interest thereon, or any premium payable on any note upon
redemption thereof;

      - change our obligation to pay additional amounts;

      - change any place of payment where, or the currency in which, any note or any premium or interest is
denominated as payable;

      - change the ranking of the notes;

      - impair the right to sue for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any note; or

      - reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding notes required to consent to any supplemental
indenture, any waiver of compliance with provisions of the indenture or specific defaults and their


-----

consequences provided for in the indenture, or otherwise modify the sections in the indenture relating to these
consents.

**Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

We may elect either (i) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the notes (except as
otherwise provided in the indenture) (“defeasance”) or (ii) to be released from our obligations with respect to certain
covenants that are described in the indenture (“covenant defeasance”), upon the deposit with the Trustee, in trust for such
purpose, of money and/or government obligations that through the payment of principal and interest in accordance with their
terms will provide money in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and any mandatory sinking fund or analogous senior payments
thereon. As a condition to defeasance or covenant defeasance, we must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the
effect that the holders of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a
result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance or covenant defeasance
had not occurred. Such opinion of counsel, in the case of defeasance under clause (i) above, must refer to and be based upon
a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable United States federal income tax law occurring after the
date of the indenture. We may exercise our defeasance option with respect to debt securities notwithstanding our prior
exercise of our covenant defeasance option. If we exercise our defeasance option, payment of such notes may not thereafter
be accelerated because of an Event of Default.

If we exercise our covenant defeasance option, payment of such notes may not thereafter be accelerated by reference
to any covenant from which we are released as described under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. However,
if acceleration were to occur for other reasons, the realizable value at the acceleration date of the money and government
obligations in the defeasance trust could be less than the principal and interest then due on such notes, in that the required
deposit in the defeasance trust is based upon scheduled cash flows rather than market value, which will vary depending upon
interest rates and other factors.

**The Trustee and Transfer and Paying Agent**

U.S. Bank National Association is the Trustee for the notes and is the transfer and paying agent for the notes.
Principal and interest will be payable, and the notes will be transferable, at the office of the paying agent. We may, however,
pay interest by check mailed to registered holders of the notes. At the maturity of the notes, the principal, together with
accrued interest thereon, will be payable in immediately available funds upon surrender of such notes at the office of the
Trustee.

No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of the notes, but we or the Trustee may, except in
specific cases not involving any transfer, require payment of a sufficient amount to cover any tax or other governmental
charge payable in connection with the transfer or exchange.

Payments of principal of, any premium on, and any interest on individual notes represented by a global note
registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee as the registered owner of
the global note representing the notes. Neither we, the Trustee, any paying agent, nor the transfer agent for the notes will have
any responsibility or liability for the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of the
global note for the notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership
interests.

We expect that the depositary for the notes or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium or
interest in respect of a permanent global note representing the notes, will immediately credit participants’ accounts with
payments in amounts proportionate to their beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global note for the notes as
shown on the records of the depositary or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial
interests in the global note held through the participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as
is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name”. The payments
will be the responsibility of those participants.

In specific instances, we or the holders of a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the notes may
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee. The Trustee may become the owner or pledgee of the notes with the
same rights, subject to conflict of interest restrictions, it would have if it were not the Trustee. Subject to applicable law


-----

relating to conflicts of interest, the Trustee may also serve as trustee under other indentures relating to securities issued by us
or our affiliated companies and may engage in commercial transactions with us and our affiliated companies.

**Notices**

Notices to holders of debt securities will be given by mail to the addresses of such holders as they appear in the
security register. In the case of global notes, notices will be delivered in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Title**

We, the Trustee and any agent of ours may treat the registered owner of any debt security as the absolute owner
thereof (whether or not the debt security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary) for the purpose of
making payment and for all other purposes.

**Replacement of Notes**

We will replace any mutilated note at the expense of the holders upon surrender to the Trustee. We will replace
notes that become destroyed, lost or stolen at the expense of the holder upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory evidence
of the destruction, loss or theft thereof. In the event of a destroyed, lost or stolen note, an indemnity or security satisfactory to
us and the Trustee may be required at the expense of the holder of the note before a replacement note will be issued.

**Governing Law**

The indenture and the notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, SETTLEMENT AND FORM**

**The Global Notes**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered Notes in global form, without interest coupons (the
“global notes”), as follows:

      - Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A global note;
and

      - Notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented
by the temporary Regulation S global note and, 40 days after the closing date, will be represented by the
permanent Regulation S global note.

Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in
the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (DTC
participants) or persons who hold interests through DTC participants. We expect that under procedures established by DTC:

      - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the
global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers; and

      - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of those
interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC
participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the
global note).

Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear
Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, a société anonyme, on behalf of the owners of such interests.

Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global note directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they
are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors may also
hold their interests in the Regulation S global note through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC
participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the
Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants.

Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for Notes in physical, certificated form except in the
limited circumstances described below.

Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among the Global Notes**

The Distribution Compliance Period will begin on the closing date and end 40 days after the closing date. During the
Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S global note may be transferred only to non-U.S.
persons under Regulation S or qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A.

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note. Depending
on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Distribution Compliance Period, and to which global note the
transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the
indenture.

A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another global note
will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in the
other global note.


-----

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream.
We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The
operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any
time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers or the Trustee are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC has advised us that it is:

      - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

      - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

      - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

      - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and

      - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s
participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing
corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC
participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on
behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner
or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, owners
of beneficial interests in a global note:

      - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names;

      - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated Notes; and

      - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the indenture for any purpose, including with
respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under the indenture.

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to
exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant
in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest).

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be
made by the Trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any
responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records of DTC relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will
be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or
indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day
funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and
operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on
the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and


-----

Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must
send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and
within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or
receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to
the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an
interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a
global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant
Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement
date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global
notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these
procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Notes**

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial
owner of the related Notes only if:

      - DTC notifies us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes and a
successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

      - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not
appointed within 90 days; or

      - we, at our option, notify the Trustee that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated Notes.


-----

**MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general discussion of material United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership
and disposition of the Notes. This discussion applies only to a United States Holder or a Non-United States Holder (each as
defined below) that acquires the Notes pursuant to this offering at the initial offering price. This discussion is based upon the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations, judicial decisions and
administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The tax considerations contained in this discussion may be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”), and we have not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the IRS concerning the Notes. This
discussion is limited to investors that hold the Notes as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes.
Furthermore, this discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be applicable to
investors in light of their particular circumstances, or to investors subject to special treatment under United States federal
income tax law, such as, without limitation, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts, United
States Holders whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar, entities that are treated as partnerships for
United States federal income tax purposes, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, certain former citizens or residents of
the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code, taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons that hold the
Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment, persons subject to special
accounting rules (including rules requiring them to recognize income with respect to the Notes no later than when such
income is taken into account in an applicable financial statement) and persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax.
Furthermore, this discussion does not address any United States federal estate or gift tax consequences, consequences of the
Medicare tax on net investment income or any state, local or non-United States tax consequences.

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) owns Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partners in a partnership that owns the Notes should consult their tax
advisors as to the particular United States federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and
advice. Investors considering the purchase of Notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of
the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the
estate or gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-United States taxing jurisdiction, or under any applicable tax
treaty.

**Additional Payments**

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the Notes, including as described
under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption” and “—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders of Notes.” These
potential payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.”
According to the applicable Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a
contingent payment debt instrument if such contingencies in the aggregate, as of the date of issuance, are remote or
incidental. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies will not cause the Notes to be treated as
“contingent payment debt instruments.” Our position is binding on an investor unless such investor discloses its contrary
position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. However, our determination concerning the effect of
these contingencies is inherently factual, and our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge
this position, an investor might be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes,
and to treat any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary interest income, rather than capital gain. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments.” Investors
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to
the Notes.

**United States Holders**

The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax considerations if you are a United States
Holder. For purposes of this summary, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for United
States federal income tax purposes:

     - an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States;


-----

      - a corporation (or any other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

      - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

      - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and
one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) in the case
of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in effect before 1997, a valid election is in place
under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust.

**Payment of Stated Interest**

Subject to the discussion above under “—Additional payments,” stated interest on a Note will be included in the
gross income of a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance
with that holder’s method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this discussion
assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a United States Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii) such
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair
market value of any property received in exchange for the Note less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid interest,
which will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as described above under “—Payment of Stated Interest”) to the extent not
previously so taxed. A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such
holder. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of such
disposition, the United States Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of a
non-corporate United States Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations. United States Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the deductibility of
capital losses in their particular circumstances.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, we must report certain information to the IRS with respect to certain payments of principal, premium (if
any) and interest on a Note, and certain payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note, to certain United States Holders. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor)
may be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer
identification number (“TIN”) to the payor or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS
notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting
described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a
correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that such payee is subject to backup withholding under the Code.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a
United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may
entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Non-United States Holders**

The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax considerations if you are a Non-United
States Holder. For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that
is, for United States federal income tax purposes:

      - a nonresident alien individual;

      - a foreign corporation; or

      - a foreign estate or trust.


-----

The following discussion assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by a Non-United States
Holder in respect of a Note at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business. Special
rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain Non-United States Holders, such as:

     - controlled foreign corporations;

     - passive foreign investment companies;

     - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;

     - investors in pass-through entities that are subject to special treatment under the Code; and

     - Non-United States Holders that are engaged in the conduct of a United States trade or business.

**Stated Interest**

Subject to the discussions below concerning backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), a Non-United
States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on payments of stated interest
on the Notes provided that the Non-United States Holder (A) does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the
total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock, (B) is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us
directly or constructively through stock ownership and (C) satisfies certain certification requirements. Such certification
requirements will generally be met if (x) the Non-United States Holder provides its name and address, and certifies on IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a substantially similar form), under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States
person or (y) a securities clearing organization or one of certain other financial institutions holding the Note on behalf of the
Non-United States Holder certifies on IRS Form W-8IMY, under penalties of perjury, that such certification from the
Non-United States Holder has been received by it and furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof. In addition, we or
our paying agent must not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner of the Note is a United States
person.

If a Non-United States Holder cannot satisfy the requirements outlined above, then interest on the Notes will
generally be subject to United States withholding tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable treaty rate).

**Disposition of the Notes**

Subject to the discussions below concerning backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), a Non-United
States Holder will not be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to gain recognized on the disposition of the
Notes unless the Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the
taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied. In such case, the Non-United States Holder will be
subject to a flat 30% tax (or lower applicable treaty rate) on any capital gain recognized on the disposition of the Notes,
which may be offset by certain United States-source capital losses.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

We must report annually to the IRS and to a Non-United States Holder the amount of interest paid to the
Non-United States Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to such interest. These reporting requirements
apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. Unless the
Non-United States Holder complies with certain certification procedures to establish that the Non-United States Holder is not
a United States person, information returns may also be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale or
other disposition of a Note. The IRS may make this information available to the tax authorities in the country in which the
Non-United States Holder is a resident.

In addition, a Non-United States Holder may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with
respect to interest payments on a Note or the proceeds from disposition of a Note, unless, generally, the Non-United States
Holder certifies under penalties of perjury (usually on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) that the Non-United States Holder
is not a United States person or the Non-United States Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Additional rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment
of proceeds from the disposition of a Note are as follows:


-----

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through the United States office of a broker, a Non-United States Holder generally
will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the Non-United States Holder certifies
under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-United States office of a broker that is not a United States person
and does not have one of certain specified United States connections, a Non-United States Holder generally will
not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.

      - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or that
has one of the specified United States connections, a Non-United States Holder generally will be subject to
information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) unless the Non-United States Holder certifies
under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the Non-United States
Holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such Non-United States Holder to a refund, provided that
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”)
generally impose a withholding tax of 30% on interest income paid on a debt obligation and on the gross proceeds from the
sale or other disposition of a debt obligation paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to
collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of
such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders
that are foreign entities with United States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial
owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification
identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United States person who directly
or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations that may be relied upon pending
finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a debt obligation would be eliminated
and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds paid from the sale or other disposition of a Note is not expected to
apply.

Intergovernmental agreements between the United States and other jurisdictions may modify the above rules.
Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the implications of FATCA with respect to their
investment in a Note.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer and the initial purchasers named below will enter into a purchase agreement with respect to the Notes.
Subject to certain conditions, each initial purchaser has severally agreed to purchase the principal amount of the Notes
indicated in the following table opposite its name.

**Principal**

**Initial purchaser** **Amount**

Barclays Capital Inc. ...................................................................................... $
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.........................................................................
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ...........................................................................
BofA Securities, Inc. ......................................................................................
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ...........................................................................
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ..............................................................
MUFG Securities Americas Inc. ..................................................................
Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. ............................................................................
Truist Securities, Inc. .....................................................................................
U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. ....................................................................
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ..........................................................................

Total ........................................................................................................... $350,000,000

The initial purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the Notes being offered, if any are taken. The initial
offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the Notes are released for sale, the initial
purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject
to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The initial
purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial purchaser has agreed that it
will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to persons it reasonably believes to be qualified institutional buyers
in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by
Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or
deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time
or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the Notes are originally issued.
The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit
of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United
States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer has agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that until the first business day
following the closing of this offering, it will not without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc., offer, sell, contract
to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities.

**Absence of Public Market for the Notes**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for the Notes
to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Issuer has been
advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the Notes but are not obligated to do so
and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading
market for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell
your Notes will be favorable.


-----

**Stabilization**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short
sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering.
Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the Notes while the offering is in progress.

The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial purchaser repays to the
initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Barclays Capital Inc. or its affiliates have
repurchased the Notes sold by or for the account of such initial purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts,
may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher
than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by
the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial
purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial
advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and
expenses. In particular, certain of the initial purchasers, or an affiliate or affiliates thereof, are or may be lenders and/or
agents under the Credit Facilities and such initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds of
this offering in connection with the repayment of a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit
Facility. U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of the trustee.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such
investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (directly, as collateral securing
other obligations or otherwise). The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may
at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers
or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit
exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps
or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default
swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment of the Notes on or about
, 2020, which will be the      business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being
referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required
to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the Notes hereunder may be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially
settle in T+     , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to the second business day immediately preceding their
date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.
