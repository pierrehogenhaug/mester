Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - Risks related to obtaining all licenses, permits, right of use or other authorizations; - Inability to attract and retain subscribers; - Failure of our systems and controls; - Inability to provide telecommunication or related services and investment to remain competitive and relevant; - Risk of illiquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs or on-going operations; - Risk of liability and sanctions of offenses committed by persons within EOLO; - Liabilities incurred by the actions of our directors, employees, agents and representatives; - Risks associated with the development, expansion and maintenance of our FWA network; - Inability to successfully compete with the high levels of competition; - Risks related to key relationships with third parties which we depend on; - Adverse impact due to regulatory measures; - Risks related to our ability to maintain existing network infrastructure or install new network infrastructure; - Adverse impact on our reputation, business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations due to damage, security breaches or cyberattacks to key information technology systems; - Inability to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent others from using such rights without authorization; - Inability to attract and retain key personnel, directors, managers, employees or individuals to effectively manage our business; - Negative impacts from lack of growth in market demand for FWA services; - Adverse impact of disruptive geopolitical or macroeconomic events and economic uncertainty; - Decreased internet usage, litigation or stricter regulation due to actual or perceived health risks relating to telecommunication transmission equipment; - Adverse impact of labor disputes or work stoppages; ix ----- - Adverse impact of disputes and legal, tax and regulatory proceedings; - Adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other health epidemics and outbreaks; - Adverse impact of negative impacts on the reputation of our brand name; - Risks related to uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage and unanticipated changes in insurance costs; - Risks related to changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy; - Inability to market and sell products or develop new products due to unsuccessful advertising and promotional activities; - Adverse impact of competition and antitrust laws; - Risks related to third parties claiming we infringed their intellectual property rights; - Adverse impact of additional tax expense or exposure; - Risks associated with estimates and assumptions relevant to our calculation of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA; - Risks related to the Transactions; - Risks related to our capital structure; - Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum.

In drafting this Offering Memorandum, we used industry sources, market research, publicly available information, industry publications and sources of market data, such as reports prepared by third party consulting firms. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Market studies and analyses are, however, frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies, publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our estimates are based. This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources. Certain market-related information reproduced in this Offering Memorandum, such as market shares and number of households, is based on reports prepared by various third-party consulting firms, which have used different underlying assumptions or sources in preparing their reports, including the number of subscribers, and, as such, some of the data may differ from each other. In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industries in which we operate, our position in the relevant industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take any responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. See “Risk factors,” “Industry” and “Business” for further discussion regarding our industry and market data and the risks related thereto. Unless specified otherwise, market shares presented in this Offering Memorandum are presented as of March 31, 2021 and are based on revenues and not on the number of subscribers. xi -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.4,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION General - Financial Statements Presented,363.4.1,,"The Issuer was incorporated on June 18, 2021, in connection with the Transactions. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or material liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions. As a result, no financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Target. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” or “our” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Target. This Offering Memorandum includes: (i) our unaudited condensed interim financial information as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2021, which include unaudited comparative financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2020, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (the “Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information”); and (ii) our audited financial statements as of and for each of the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Audited Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information, the “Financial Statements”). On April 1, 2020, we adopted IFRS. For prior periods, we had prepared our financial statements in accordance with Italian GAAP. Our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019 were prepared in accordance with the Italian GAAP and the financial information in respect of such period was restated in our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 to reflect the adoption of IFRS. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP have not been included in this Offering Memorandum. Therefore, the financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 included and discussed in this Offering Memorandum is that presented as comparative information in our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 which was not covered by the audit reports included therein. In the future, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Acquisition Closing Date but prior to the Merger Date to holders of the Notes at the level of the Issuer in accordance with IFRS. Following the Post-Completion Merger, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Merger Date to holders of the Notes at the level of MergerCo in accordance with IFRS. Our financial statements in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the statements of profit and loss and comprehensive income, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer (prior to the Merger Date) and MergerCo (following the Merger Date), as applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also recognize additional amortization and depreciation expenses related to the additional assets recognized. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. xx ----- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Financial Statements.

624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.7,Non-IFRS Measures,363.7.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. We refer to these measures as “non-IFRS measures” as they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, we present certain financial measures of the Target and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, and other measures and ratios that are not recognized by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). We use such measures to assess the operating financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe that these and similar measures are used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as supplemental measures of financial performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt. In particular, given certain one-off transactions that have had a significant impact on EOLO S.p.A.’s profit or loss statement, the growth in our subscriber base and the extensive investments in network expansion that have been made during the periods under review, EOLO’s management monitors Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA (each of which is defined below) for purposes of internal capital allocation decision-making and budget planning. The foregoing are presented in this Offering Memorandum because EOLO’s management believes that they can assist readers to understand the underlying dynamics of the core business operations of EOLO S.p.A., and that they provide meaningful and relevant financial information that is useful in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s operations in the same manner as EOLO’s management views and xxi ----- operates the business. EOLO’s management presents the foregoing Non-IFRS Measures because similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations and ability to service debt. In addition, EOLO’s management believes that Operating Free Cash Flow is a useful Non-IFRS Measure to use in evaluating business performance and to inform future expenditure planning because it illustrates cash generation on a basis that is comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure, permitting EOLO’s management to analyze the business in a consistent manner. Furthermore, EOLO’s management believes that Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a relevant Non-IFRS Measure that can assist in capital allocation and planning operating and capital expenditures based on ability of the business to generate cash. Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Target’s operating results as reported under IFRS. A more detailed explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS Measures, a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical _and Certain Other Financial Data—As Adjusted Financial Information.” We do not regard these Non-IFRS_ Measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS Measures that we use in this Offering Memorandum are defined as follows: - “Reported EBITDA” is defined as profit/(loss) for the year before income taxes, financial income and financial expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on trade receivables and other financial assets, impairment losses on non-current assets and long-term incentive plan (LTIP); - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Reported EBITDA as adjusted for certain advertising costs, monitoring fees, transactions costs, commission and activations fees, CPE installation related costs, ADSL business and other sundry adjustments; - “Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the full period effect of new subscribers as of June 30, 2021; - “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue and other income, expressed as a percentage; - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue and other income, expressed as a percentage; - “Total Capital Expenditures” is defined as the sum of acquisitions of intangible assets and acquisitions of property, plant and equipment; - “Adjusted Capital Expenditures” are defined as Total Capital Expenditures adjusted for, inter alia, CPE related installation capital expenditures, and IRU leases, disposal, other and other minor items; - “Operating Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash flows generated by operating activities as reported in accordance with IFRS as adjusted for CPE related installation cash flow, the variation attributable to the phasing of certain Adjusted Capital Expenditure-related payables and other items; - “Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth)” is defined as Operating Free Cash Flow as further adjusted for hosting lease payments, other operating items and CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures; - “Cash Conversion” is defined as Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) divided by Adjusted EBITDA; - “Working Capital” is defined as trade receivables, contract costs and other current liabilities less trade payables, contract liabilities and other current liabilities; - “As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents” as of June 30, 2021 is defined as Cash and Cash Equivalent after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021; xxii ----- - “As Adjusted Cash Interest Expense” is defined as the cash interest expense of the Issuer for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on July 1, 2020 and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility would have been undrawn for the entire period which is calculated by taking the sum of (i) interest rate on the Notes multiplied by the total aggregate principal amount of Notes, (ii) the actual fixed charges in respect of the Target Rolled Indebtedness and (iii) the actual fixed charges in respect of IFRS 16 lease liabilities; - “As Adjusted Net Debt” is defined as the total gross financial indebtedness of the Target (net of As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalent) as of the date indicated after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021; and - “As Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt” is defined as the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, less As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum under “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data.” The Non-IFRS Measures are not measures of financial performance recognized under IFRS and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows, the basis for dividend distribution or as measures of liquidity. Consequently, the methodology used for their calculation may not be consistent with that adopted by other companies and, therefore, the Non-IFRS Measures we present herein may not be comparable with those of others. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of profit and loss and comprehensive income; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations or as measures of performance in order to assist in the analysis of our operating results, profitability. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only as a supplement to evaluate our performance.

Our mission is to close the digital and speed divide by offering high-speed broadband connectivity services in underserved rural (i.e., White areas) and suburban areas (i.e., Grey II areas) in Italy where alternative connection technologies are either unavailable or significantly delayed (i.e., FTTH) or have lower speed and quality performance (i.e., ADSL or FTTC). As a result, we mainly focus on identified rural and suburban areas comprising approximately 11.5 million households in Italy where the penetration of broadband connection services is lower than in the rest of Italy and where we offer the highest available speed (our “Target Addressable Market” or “TAM”). Our unique FWA infrastructure platform enables us to offer in our Target Addressable Market, in a cost-effective manner, speeds of up to 100 Mbps (download speed) and we are working to increase connection speeds to 300 Mbps in the near future to further distinguish our service offer. With selected business customers, we already offer speeds of up 1 Gbps (download speed) through point-to-point (“PTP”) wireless link connections. In recent years, we have aggressively expanded our FWA network coverage to reach more than 80% of households in our Target Addressable Market and more than 6,700 municipalities across Italy’s 20 regions. This resulted in a strong growth of our subscriber base from approximately 379,600 as of March 31, 2019 to 567,900 as of June 30, 2021, with a CAGR of 19.6%. Our market share in our Target Addressable Market was 51.5% of FWA connections as of March 31, 2021.

Due to the lack of cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and difficult morphology, only approximately 67% of Italian households have a broadband connection versus a European average penetration of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services are expected to grow and close this gap on the back of growing data consumption as evidenced by the 25.6% average annual growth rate of fixed line data consumption from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2020 and the 35.7% average annual growth in mobile data traffic from 2017 to 2020 due to changes in consumer behavior and the availability of increased speeds. The main drivers of data traffic growth include trends such as the growing use of streaming platforms, online shopping, online banking applications, video-on-demand as well as gaming and video activities. The growing adoption of these new applications was boosted by social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns and the ensuing changes in work and life habits (e.g., remote working, home schooling, and greater adoption of virtual social interactions). On the back of these long-term trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to continue growing for the period from 2021 to 2024, driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage. The graphic below shows the monthly data traffic in Italy for the period 2017-2020 and the forecast for the period 2021-2024. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The other principal player in Italy with a focus on FWA technology is Linkem. While Linkem has a larger number of subscribers than EOLO, it is focused on prepaid solutions for urban and suburban areas and uses the 3.5 GHz spectrum, which allows for less bandwidth (and therefore lower quality of service). Linkem’s growth in subscribers was lower than EOLO’s (approximately 11% CAGR (December 2017-2020) compared to EOLO’s 24% (March 2018-2021). Other players in the FWA market include operators such as TIM and Vodafone, which have “FWA-like” service offers based on their mobile infrastructure. While these “FWA-like” services will be used in selected situations, these services are considered sub-optimal in comparison with FWA since they are unable to match the data allowance offered by FWA and their implementation can present technical difficulties. In the wholesale sector, we are the main player offering access to an FWA network in our Target Addressable Market, which we believe will enable us to capture additional subscribers and therefore continue to grow our subscriber base and market share in the medium term. As part of its plans to guarantee broadband deployment in low population density areas with high investment costs, in accordance with the provisions of the EU broadband State Aid guidelines implemented by the Italian government, Open Fiber is required to provide FWA active services in White II Areas to third-party operators if no comparable access product is already offered in the same geographic area by another operator. As EOLO already provides active services in such areas, Open Fiber will not be required to offer active services in such areas. Even though Open Fiber might still decide to establish an FWA infrastructure in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that our 80% coverage in our Target Addressable Market will act as an economic disincentive for Open Fiber. This provides us with a pre-emptive opportunity in White II areas, thus underpinning the uniqueness of our FWA infrastructure and the leadership position in our Target Addressable Market. Our leading market position in our Target Addressable Market is underpinned by the superior performance of our FWA service offering in such areas as compared to other available fixed BB and UBB technologies. In our Target Addressable Market, FTTH technology is either largely unavailable or expected to be deployed with delays while other available technologies, such as ADSL and FTTC, do not offer the same speed and overall performance levels. Our unique FWA network enables us to currently offer the highest available speed in our Target Addressable Market with download/upload speeds of up to 100/20 Mbps and up to 1Gbps for selected business clients and we have an established roadmap to roll out services with a download speed of up to 300 Mbps in the near future. In addition, our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class intervention services, low time to market and effective maintenance and repair services. Our leading market position is further supported by our technological knowhow, which has enabled us to develop unique, proprietary and data-driven technologies to support our functions. These custom solutions include: - EOLIA is our self-designed software for network design, operations, management and monitoring, which plays a critical role for our network planning and installation approach and which has contributed to our successful network expansion and customer satisfaction. We use EOLIA to identify the overall network topology, health status for wireless access and wireless backhaul network, wireless backhauling link occupation and historical data and trends; - G-EOLO is our location intelligence system which uses internal information and external sources to identify potentially attractive market areas for our network expansion; 4 ----- - Blue system is our patented traffic re-balancing platform. As part of our Blue system, we have also developed Otelma, our in-house built software, which continuously applies traffic steering policy avoiding backhauling congestion; and - Datawave is our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and warehouse management. The main functions covered by Datawave relate to the automated processes of the operational activities carried out by our installers. For example, Datawave help us assign the work orders to our installers and exchanges information with EOLIA about the field activities aimed at the installation of new BTSs. Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’ architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. On-field feedback is key to improve our performances. For example, we have managers focusing on specific areas of the Italian territory (i.e., North West, North East, Center and South of Italy). Our area managers, inter alia, update our internal database in case of poor coverage in certain areas and/or competitors’ presence. We also work with two primary radio access equipment manufacturers in the design and development of point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) and PTP connections: Cambium Networks Ltd. and Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions. Over the last few years, we have leveraged our strong relationships with our suppliers to develop multiple access technologies to achieve optimal coverage and network performance. We believe that our superior service offering and technological leadership provide us with a clear competitive advantage resulting in high customer satisfaction rates (more than 85% for the month ended April 31, 2021, based on the number of customers declaring themselves “very satisfied” after interactions with our technicians) and in our leading and growing market share. We also believe our leading market position places us well to meet the growing demand for high-speed connectivity services in our Target Addressable Market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The penetration of broadband services in these areas is lower than at national level with penetration levels between 56% and 60% as compared to a national average of 67% as of December 31, 2019. The low internet penetration is primarily due to the fact that these areas are serviced mainly through legacy ADSL and FTTC connections which have proven to be ineffective in delivering high-speed connections in areas with challenging geography and low population density. For example, ADSL connections offer maximum speeds of up to 30 Mbps. FTTC connections, on the other hand, offer speeds of up to 100 Mbps, but only if the customer premise is close to the fiber cabinet. FTTC connection speeds reduce to 30 Mbps for distances from the cabinet of up to 1 kilometer. This distance tends to increase as the service area becomes more rural (i.e., less home density). There is also a wide variation in the distribution of the secondary copper length in suburban and rural areas, which leads to inconsistent performance.

While FTTH technology can deliver connection speeds of up to 1 Gbps, it is a suboptimal technology for rural and suburban areas for several reasons. First, FTTH has high installation and deployment costs, making it a viable technology primarily in densely populated areas. For instance, the average FTTH development capital expenditures per household connected in rural areas is estimated to be more than double the capital expenditures required for FWA, resulting in significantly longer payback periods. 6 ----- FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21F FY22F FY23F FY24F (1) broadband access at fixed location, for one household.

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router). In addition, FTTH has experienced long installation periods in rural areas, making it a less appealing technology as compared to FWA. In the few White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is a significant time gap between completion of the network and availability for use by broadband operators due to lack of last meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates a time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be exploited by FWA operators. Finally, Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans have experienced several delays as compared to their original schedule, with only 22.6% of targeted municipalities in White I Areas tested as of August 2021. As a result, FTTH is not expected to be deployed to the Grey II and White II areas of our Target Addressable Market, which represent 6.9 million households (or 29% of total Italian households) or will be deployed on a delayed basis compared to Open Fiber’s original plans for White I areas, representing an additional 4.0 million households (15% of total). Accordingly, FWA can be seen as the best technological alternative to FTTH in our Target Addressable Market on account of FWA’s generally competitive broadband speeds, lower roll-out cost and more rapid speed of network deployment as compared to FTTH. In addition, we believe that 5G mobile technology does not represent a viable alternative to FWA service in our Target Addressable Market. First, 5G mobile technology is designed to offer connectivity in a mobile context, rather than to be a fixed broadband service. In addition, the substantial upfront investment needed to deploy 5G infrastructure in low-density rural and suburban areas in Italy (such as our Target Addressable Market), including the cost of towers and other assets, are unlikely to generate an attractive return on investment for 5G operators. Mobile operators offering “FWA-like” solutions are also not expected to present a meaningful competitive threat to EOLO, as their solutions are based on mobile technology which may face congestion issues (as the same spectrum is used for mobile and fixed users, which typically leads to data caps). In contrast, EOLO utilizes a different network architecture with fixed line-of-sight from the antennas to the houses, ensuring a fixed bandwidth for each household. These considerations explain why the number of FWA connections in Italy has doubled over the last five years from 0.74 million in 2015 to 1.37 million in September 2020 to 1.54 million in December 2020, resulting in an increase in FWA’s penetration of the Italian broadband market from 5% to 9% of all broadband technologies. Due to its geographical characteristics and large number of small municipalities (i.e., municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants), Italy is by far the European country with the highest number of FWA connections and the highest FWA proportion of fixed BB lines. 7 ----- The graphic below shows the amount (measured in thousands of households) of FWA connections (‘000 households) in Europe between 2016 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Moreover, in 2021, DAZN, a global sports streaming platform, acquired the rights to broadcast seven out of 10 exclusive matches per match week in Italy from 2021 to 2024 for Serie A football. This represents the first time that Italian football matches will be shown via streaming as the primary broadcaster of the competition, and the 91 ----- majority of Serie A football matches will no longer be available via satellite channels. Such a shift embodies the trend of the digitalization of broadcast television and the switch to streaming content requiring broadband connections. Š **The connected home: The use of connected audio and video entertainment devices in particular has become relatively widespread: in 2020, for example, 51% of individuals in the EU reported to EUROSTAT that they used the internet on a smart TV, games console, home audio system, or smart speaker. Moreover, 11% of EU citizens surveyed in 2020 used a voice assistant. As homes become more connected to multiple devices, broadband, in particular wireless connectivity, is becoming more central. Š **The Internet of Things: Smart wearable devices are also becoming a feature of EU citizens’ lives. In 2020, 19% of individuals in the EU used a smart watch, fitness band, connected goggles or headset, safety tracker or smart clothing, accessories, or shoes. The highly connected nature of this proliferation of Internet of Things devices means that broadband Internet demand is accelerating. On the back of these trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to continue growing for the period 2021-2024, driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage.

Broadband penetration in Italy (67%) is materially lower than the European Union average (87%). Our results of operations are affected by the continued development in our infrastructure network, namely: (i) the expansion of coverage, particularly from the North of Italy, where EOLO has historically been present, to the South of Italy and (ii) upgrading infrastructure network from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth. We typically monitor and plan the development of infrastructure network through the number of municipalities we cover within Italy. Expansion of our infrastructure network affects our results of operations in the following ways: Š drives revenue growth as the more subscribers and communities we can reach, the greater our addressable subscriber base; Š increases our operating expenses, in particular related to purchases of materials and services and labor costs, though each tend to remain fairly stable as a percentage of revenues as further described under “—Our cost structure”; Š increases our growth capital expenditures, which in presents the following dynamic: Š **infrastructure network expansion: installation of additional BTS permits us to offer FWA services in new communities, thereby encouraging a growth in our subscriber base; FWA technology offers the competitive advantage that capital expenditures are majority successbased as construction, installation and rent payments for BTS represent less than the majority of the Total Capital Expenditures (capital expenditures at risk), Š **success-based customer connections: the majority of growth capital expenditures necessary to connect a subscriber corresponds to CPE and activation expenses which are incurred in connection with the activation of a new subscription plan once future revenue is secured (success based capital expenditures); and 93 ----- Š increases our capital expenditures; as CPE withdrawal capital expenditures are incurred for churned customers and replacement and repairing capital expenditures increase with a larger customer base. We have invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in acquisitions of property, plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2019 to the year ended March 31, 2021.

We typically have high revenue visibility due to stickiness of our subscriber contracts and an industry-leading low churn rate as discussed below under “—Customer churn rate.” The addition of new subscribers has the following impact on our results of operations: Š marketing and sales and selling commissions increase in anticipation of and during periods of intense net subscriber increases; and Š to retain subscribers, we incur costs to invest to maintain quality of service, invest in customer care functions, replace obsolescent equipment and maintain our network. We focus on the B2C segment.

In general, the greater the optionality, the higher the price of the subscription package, up to €36.90. Our ability to grow our subscriber base depends in part on our customer service providers and our community of installers, in particular for the growth of our B2C segment. Customer assistance services help us build and maintain good relationships with our customers, which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. We outsource our CPE installation and replacement to around 600 contractors and 1,500 technicians that are trained by us, which are distributed across the country. We support the growth of our community of installers by providing continuous training, assistance, equipment and engagement activities.

Due to the lack of cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and difficult morphology, only approximately 67% of Italian households have a broadband connection versus a European average penetration of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services are expected to grow and close this gap on the back of growing data consumption as evidenced by the 25.6% average annual growth rate of fixed line data consumption from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2020 and the 35.7% average annual growth in mobile data traffic from 2017 to 2020 due to changes in consumer behavior and the availability of increased speeds. The main drivers of data traffic growth include trends such as the growing use of streaming platforms, online shopping, online banking applications, video-on-demand as well as gaming and video activities. The growing adoption of these new applications was boosted by social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns and the ensuing changes in work and life habits (e.g., remote working, home schooling, and greater adoption of virtual social interactions). On the back of these long-term trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to continue growing for the period from 2021 to 2024, driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage. The graphic below shows the monthly data traffic in Italy for the period 2017-2020 and the forecast for the period 2021-2024.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The other principal player in Italy with a focus on FWA technology is Linkem. While Linkem has a larger number of subscribers than EOLO, it is focused on prepaid solutions for urban and suburban areas and uses the 3.5 GHz spectrum, which allows for less bandwidth (and therefore lower quality of service). Linkem’s growth in subscribers was lower than EOLO’s (approximately 11% CAGR (December 2017-2020) compared to EOLO’s 24% (March 2018-2021). Other players in the FWA market include operators such as TIM and Vodafone, which 134 ----- have “FWA-like” service offers based on their mobile infrastructure. While these “FWA-like” services will be used in selected situations, these services are considered sub-optimal in comparison with FWA since they are unable to match the data allowance offered by FWA and their implementation can present technical difficulties. In the wholesale sector, we are the main player offering access to an FWA network in our Target Addressable Market, which we believe will enable us to capture additional subscribers and therefore continue to grow our subscriber base and market share in the medium term. As part of its plans to guarantee broadband deployment in low population density areas with high investment costs, in accordance with the provisions of the EU broadband State Aid guidelines implemented by the Italian government, Open Fiber is required to provide FWA active services in White II Areas to third-party operators if no comparable access product is already offered in the same geographic area by another operator. As EOLO already provides active services in such areas, Open Fiber will not be required to offer active services in such areas. Even though Open Fiber might still decide to establish an FWA infrastructure in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that our 80% coverage in our Target Addressable Market will act as an economic disincentive for Open Fiber. This provides us with a pre-emptive opportunity in White II areas, thus underpinning the uniqueness of our FWA infrastructure and the leadership position in our Target Addressable Market. Our leading market position in our Target Addressable Market is underpinned by the superior performance of our FWA service offering in such areas as compared to other available fixed BB and UBB technologies. In our Target Addressable Market, FTTH technology is either largely unavailable or expected to be deployed with delays while other available technologies, such as ADSL and FTTC, do not offer the same speed and overall performance levels. Our unique FWA network enables us to currently offer the highest available speed in our Target Addressable Market with download/upload speeds of up to 100/20 Mbps and up to 1Gbps for selected business clients and we have an established roadmap to roll out services with a download speed of up to 300 Mbps in the near future. In addition, our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class intervention services, low time to market and effective maintenance and repair services. Our leading market position is further supported by our technological knowhow, which has enabled us to develop unique, proprietary and data-driven technologies to support our functions. These custom solutions include: ‰ EOLIA is our self-designed software for network design, operations, management and monitoring, which plays a critical role for our network planning and installation approach and which has contributed to our successful network expansion and customer satisfaction. We use EOLIA to identify the overall network topology, health status for wireless access and wireless backhaul network, wireless backhauling link occupation and historical data and trends; ‰ G-EOLO is our location intelligence system which uses internal information and external sources to identify potentially attractive market areas for our network expansion; ‰ Blue system is our patented traffic re-balancing platform. As part of our Blue system, we have also developed Otelma, our in-house built software, which continuously applies traffic steering policy avoiding backhauling congestion; and ‰ Datawave is our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and warehouse management. The main functions covered by Datawave relate to the automated processes of the operational activities carried out by our installers. For example, Datawave help us assign the work orders to our installers and exchanges information with EOLIA about the field activities aimed at the installation of new BTSs. Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’ architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. On-field feedback is key to improve our performances. For example, we have managers focusing on specific areas of the Italian territory (i.e., North West, North East, Center and South of Italy). Our area managers, inter alia, update our internal database in case of poor coverage in certain areas and/or competitors’ presence. We also work with two primary radio access equipment manufacturers in the design and development of point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) and PTP connections: Cambium Networks Ltd. and Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions. Over the last few years, we have leveraged our strong relationships with our suppliers to develop multiple access technologies to achieve optimal coverage and network performance. We believe that our superior service offering and technological leadership provide us with a clear competitive advantage resulting in high customer satisfaction rates (more than 85% for the month ended April 31, 2021, 135 ----- based on the number of customers declaring themselves “very satisfied” after interactions with our technicians) and in our leading and growing market share. We also believe our leading market position places us well to meet the growing demand for high-speed connectivity services in our Target Addressable Market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router). In addition, FTTH has experienced long installation periods in rural areas, making it a less appealing technology as compared to FWA. In the few White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is a significant time gap between completion of the network and availability for use by broadband operators due to lack of last meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates a time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be exploited by FWA operators. Finally, Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans have experienced several delays as compared to their original schedule, with only 22.6% of targeted municipalities in White I Areas tested as of August 2021. As a result, FTTH is not expected to be deployed to the Grey II and White II areas of our Target Addressable Market, which represent 6.9 million households (or 29% of total Italian households) or will be deployed on a delayed basis compared to Open Fiber’s original plans for White I areas, representing an additional 4.0 million households (15% of total). Accordingly, FWA can be seen as the best technological alternative to FTTH in our Target Addressable Market on account of FWA’s generally competitive broadband speeds, lower roll-out cost and more rapid speed of network deployment as compared to FTTH. In addition, we believe that 5G mobile technology does not represent a viable alternative to FWA service in our Target Addressable Market. First, 5G mobile technology is designed to offer connectivity in a mobile context, rather than to be a fixed broadband service. In addition, the substantial upfront investment needed to deploy 5G infrastructure in low-density rural and suburban areas in Italy (such as our Target Addressable Market), including the cost of towers and other assets, are unlikely to generate an attractive return on investment for 5G operators. Mobile operators offering “FWA-like” solutions are also not expected to present a meaningful competitive threat to EOLO, as their solutions are based on mobile technology which may face congestion issues (as the same spectrum is used for mobile and fixed users, which typically leads to data caps). In contrast, EOLO utilizes a different network architecture with fixed line-of-sight from the antennas to the houses, ensuring a fixed bandwidth for each household. These considerations explain why the number of FWA connections in Italy has doubled over the last five years from 0.74 million in 2015 to 1.37 million in September 2020 to 1.54 million in December 2020, resulting in an increase in FWA’s penetration of the Italian broadband market from 5% to 9% of all broadband technologies. Due to its geographical characteristics and large number of small municipalities (i.e., municipalities with less 137 |(>5|0%)| |---|---| ----- than 5,000 inhabitants), Italy is by far the European country with the highest number of FWA connections and the highest FWA proportion of fixed BB lines. The graphic below shows the amount (measured in thousands of households) of FWA connections (‘000 households) in Europe between 2016 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Our external network of approximately 1,500 technicians (known as “installers”) across Italy provides us with in-depth local knowledge and a capillary presence in our Target Addressable Market, which in turn is instrumental to our ability to offer high service levels. As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network that is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We offer our excess capacity on a wholesale basis to other operators who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to acquire new customers or migrate customers currently served through non-performing technologies in Italian rural and suburban areas. Building on this strategy, in 2020 we signed an agreement with Wind 3 and in 2021 announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM; these strategic partnership projects are focused on our Target Addressable Market, where TIM and Wind 3 will be able to provide internet access services to their existing and new customers using our proprietary infrastructure network. We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth, particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of coaxial cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and difficult geographic terrain, only approximately 67% of Italian households as of December 31, 2019 had a fixed broadband connection as compared to a European average penetration rate of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services, principally through FWA technology in rural and suburban areas, are expected to continue to expand and close this penetration gap on the back of growing data consumption driven by changing consumer habits (such as remote working) and the growing use of online streaming, which trend has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that there is an untapped growth opportunity in our Target Addressable Market, where broadband penetration and high-speed connections are significantly lower than the national average level (penetration levels between 56% and 60%). Given the physical geography and low population density of many Italian rural and suburban communities, FWA can be the best technological alternative to deliver high broadband speeds at competitive prices given its limited roll-out costs and fast network deployment times in these areas. Legacy technologies (i.e., ADSL and FTTC) are proving less effective to meet the growing demand for bandwidth, while FTTH is either not going to be deployed or will be deployed only with delays in these areas, in part due to the significant investments required. As the largest provider of broadband and ultra-broadband services in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to exploit this growth opportunity. The expansion of our FWA network and service offering in recent years has driven the growth of our total revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. From the year ended March 31, 2019 our total revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million, respectively, to €198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a CAGR of 23.0%), respectively, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

Our backbone is secured by long-term indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”) of third parties’ dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800 kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018); ‰ _Distribution Network. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. As of March 31, 2021, our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 fiber-to-the-antenna links to base transceiver stations (“BTS”) (i.e., fiber-to-the-antenna). As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600 radio links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately +41% compared to March 31, 2018); and ‰ _Access Network. As of August 31, 2021, our access network is based on approximately 3,400 BTS (an increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018), which deliver signal 132 ----- to the customer premises equipment (the “CPE”), installed on customers’ premises, primarily using (i) the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum (for our 30 Mbps EOLO Wave offering) and (ii) the licensed 28 GHz spectrum (for our advanced, higher speed 100 Mbps EOLO Wave G offering). Our external network of approximately 1,500 technicians (known as “installers”) across Italy provides us with in-depth local knowledge and a capillary presence in our Target Addressable Market, which in turn is instrumental to our ability to offer high service levels. As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network that is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We offer our excess capacity on a wholesale basis to other operators who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to acquire new customers or migrate customers currently served through non-performing technologies in Italian rural and suburban areas. Building on this strategy, in 2020 we signed an agreement with Wind 3 and in 2021 announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM; these strategic partnership projects are focused on our Target Addressable Market, where TIM and Wind 3 will be able to provide internet access services to their existing and new customers using our proprietary infrastructure network. We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth, particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of coaxial cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and difficult geographic terrain, only approximately 67% of Italian households as of December 31, 2019 had a fixed broadband connection as compared to a European average penetration rate of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services, principally through FWA technology in rural and suburban areas, are expected to continue to expand and close this penetration gap on the back of growing data consumption driven by changing consumer habits (such as remote working) and the growing use of online streaming, which trend has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that there is an untapped growth opportunity in our Target Addressable Market, where broadband penetration and high-speed connections are significantly lower than the national average level (penetration levels between 56% and 60%). Given the physical geography and low population density of many Italian rural and suburban communities, FWA can be the best technological alternative to deliver high broadband speeds at competitive prices given its limited roll-out costs and fast network deployment times in these areas. Legacy technologies (i.e., ADSL and FTTC) are proving less effective to meet the growing demand for bandwidth, while FTTH is either not going to be deployed or will be deployed only with delays in these areas, in part due to the significant investments required. As the largest provider of broadband and ultra-broadband services in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to exploit this growth opportunity. The expansion of our FWA network and service offering in recent years has driven the growth of our total revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. From the year ended March 31, 2019 our total revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million, respectively, to €198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a CAGR of 23.0%), respectively, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the same period, our loss for the year/period increased from €0.5 million to €14.9 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 94% of our total revenues and other income was generated from subscription-based revenues from monthly recurring debits by customers and approximately 6% was generated from one-off payments, including activation fees and penalties for churned customers. We divide our offering into the following three segments: ‰ **Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 490,700 B2C subscribers (“B2C Subscribers”). Our offering to B2C Subscribers includes modular commercial offerings designed to address different users’ needs with dedicated add-on packages: “Entertainment” (streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and remote working applications) and “Security” (antivirus and parental control). ‰ **Business-to-Business (“B2B”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 75,900 B2B subscribers (“B2B Subscribers”). Our offering to B2B Subscribers includes connectivity services for small and home offices (“SoHo”) and small and medium enterprises (“Business”) to which we offer shared solutions, and for large companies (“TOP”) to which we offer services through high-end connectivity and dedicated infrastructure. ‰ **FTTH. Although it does not represent our core business, we provide a FTTH service mainly in certain urban areas covered by Open Fiber’s FTTH infrastructure to complement our FWA services in order to meet customer demand. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,400 fiber subscribers (“Fiber Subscribers”). 133 ----- As of June 30, 2021, our B2C and B2B Subscribers included approximately 48,500 wholesale end-customers (“Wholesale Subscribers”). We sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through internet service providers (“ISP”), system integrators and to national internet providers and international telecommunications providers to whom we offer our excess capacity. We plan to strengthen our wholesale offering in the future relying more on major national and international providers such as TIM and Wind 3 and further expand our wholesale offering to retail customers.

Our proprietary data-driven network planning and cost-conscious approach to new installations have historically yielded successful network expansion, generated high customer satisfaction levels and supported our profitable growth. We intend to continue the technological upgrade of our infrastructure network to offer high connection speeds and improved service quality, to upsell our service offering to our existing customer base and to manage our churn rate. Our network upgrade is based on three key pillars: - _Migration from EOLO Wave to EOLO Wave G. EOLO Wave is the FWA broadband service which leverages the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum (or 3.5 GHz in Valle d’Aosta) and offers a maximum download speed of 30 Mbps. EOLO Wave G is the ultra-broadband FWA service using the 28 GHz licensed spectrum and offers a maximum speed of 100 Mbps and up to 1 Gbps for selected B2B customers (i.e., customers who have a PTP connection). As of June 30, 2021, approximately 76% and 23% of our customers relied on EOLO Wave and EOLO Wave G, respectively, for their connectivity. In recent years, we have started to increase our 28 GHz presence and migrate subscribers from 5 GHz to 28 GHz plans. The historical churn rate is higher on 5 GHz products as compared to 28 GHz products as 28 GHz products have higher performance. As a result, one of the tools that we have to proactively prevent churn is to offer upgrades to customers who may be served by BTS that are overutilized in the 5 GHz bandwidth. As we increase our 28 GHz presence, we intend to follow our roadmap to attain download speeds of up to 300 Mbps in the near future and provide this solution to all of our customers relying on EOLO Wave G for their connectivity. - _Expansion of our fiber backhauling. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. Our fiber backhauling provides direct fiber connections which bring higher capacity and availability as compared to our radio links. Our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. As part of our strategy to expand our fiber backhauling and therefore improve our network reliability and efficiency, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open Fiber which secured us access to an additional 1,000 FTTA links. - _Continuous development of our proprietary software and applications. We continue to make investments to drive the development of our own digital infrastructure in order to improve reliability, coverage and speed. Our research and development efforts in recent years have included, and will continue to include, two main projects: 5G NR (New Radio) and traffic optimization. 5G NR is a new radio access technology developed for 5G mobile networks. It is designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks. In recent years, we have been working with our suppliers to develop a 5G NR standard compatible solution able to support FWA technology services. In our second main project, since 2014 we have developed our own BTS router with the goal of optimizing network traffic. We have also developed Otelma, our in-house designed software, which continuously applies traffic steering policies to avoid backhauling congestion. Our goal is to leverage our research and 14 ----- development outputs and roll them out across our network to support the reliability, redundancy and efficiency of the services we provide.

Our FWA network presently covers approximately 80% of households in our Target Addressable Market and we expect this coverage to increase significantly following expansion of our fiber backhauling, the deployment of new 28 GHz BTS and the upgrade of existing BTS. We plan to continue to manage carefully our FWA network expansion and maximize our network efficiency leveraging the following: - _Our network planning tools. We will continue to use our proprietary, data-driven network planning and installation tools and applications, such as EOLIA and G-EOLO. Using these tools, we carry out in-depth analyses using multiple criteria to assess potential new development areas, including: the coverage request coming from a certain area, the market potential, socio-demographic characteristics and the competitor presence. This process allows us to assess a suitability score to each area and to highlight the most profitable areas for our coverage expansion. After the area has been identified, we conduct the on-site survey to choose the optimum tower sites and finalize the technical configuration. The process ends with the devices being activated and configured by EOLIA. By using this process and our proprietary software application EOLIA, we have been able to optimize our selection process for new installations and achieve attractive payback periods for our investments in network expansion. - _Deep territorial knowledge. Our installers represent a unique asset and are critical to our success. We have been supporting the creation of our community of installers providing continuous training, assistance, supporting tools and applications and engagement activities. Installers are selected based on their connections with the territory and their experience and we believe this will help us acquire customers in underserved areas and build our new customers’ loyalty, as installers represent a trusted point of reference for customers. The large majority of the investments that we have made over the past three years to expand our FWA network included investments in CPE (including installation) and BTS (equal to 83.7%, 83.0% and 79.7% of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively). For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, approximately 63.0%, 64.3% and 62.4%, respectively, of our Adjusted Capital Expenditure are growth-related with the balance related to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base (e.g., maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling to 28 GHz spectrum solutions). Of our Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures, the majority relates to CPE and is therefore success-based. Our remaining Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures relate to increases in data capacity and BTS investments, which are driven by our data driven technologically-advanced network development applications, which have proven successful so far in identifying new areas of profitable growth. For these reasons, we believe that a large proportion of our Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures are low risk, success based and closely related to the growth of our customer base. We intend to continue to be disciplined in our selection process of new areas of profitable growth. We believe that we are well-positioned to expand our subscriber base in Grey II and White areas for the reasons outlined in the table below. |BB Areas|EOLO’s strategy| |---|---| |Grey II|• Target an underpenetrated market of 4.6 million households with better technology (FWA) than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where FTTH coverage is not expected. • The Government is concentrated on bridging the digital divide and therefore we expect that future government tenders will be focused on areas where EOLO is not already present. • The Government may offer public subsidies to private operators in underserved areas where none are currently present or plan to expand into; this may offer upside potential related to areas currently not included in EOLO’s network coverage plan that has been shared with the Government.| 15 ----- |BB Areas|EOLO’s strategy| |---|---| |White I|• Target an underpenetrated market of 4.0 million households currently served with low-speed broadband and where FWA is the best technological alternative to FTTH. • FWA and FTTH can co-exist in White I areas for the long term and jointly address the digital divide. FTTH is not expected to be rolled out in 100% of White I households due to high technical KO rates and expensive last mile connection. • Open Fiber’s delay in network roll-out opens a window of opportunity for EOLO to capture subscribers first and then prevent these subscribers from changing to other operators when EOLO is rolled out by offering speeds that would be sufficient for most consumers. EOLO will also be able to re-sell Open Fiber’s open-access FTTH to its customers as a churn mitigation tactic.| |White II|• Target underpenetrated market of 2.9 million households with better technology (FWA) than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where no FTTH coverage is currently foreseen. • Pre-empt Open Fiber’s FWA network roll-out by rolling out its own network first. Considering the delay in Open Fiber’s roll-out plan (only 3.6% of FWA network has been completed as of August 2021), and EOLO’s territorial and technological knowledge, we believe EOLO has a strong competitive edge. As of February 2021, Open Fiber received 321 FWA orders (81% KO rate compared to 25% KO EOLO’s rate).| We intend to accelerate the nationwide expansion of our FWA infrastructure network, particularly in the South of Italy where we have less of a presence.

We currently offer and expect to continue to offer our excess capacity to other national operators that can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to either sell solutions to new customers who are located in areas where such operators do not have a network infrastructure or migrate customers currently served through underperforming technologies in our Target Addressable Market. In addition, we plan to expand our wholesale channel by selling our solutions to independent and local ISP who are not able to sustain the network investments required to update their wireless networks with the latest technologies or to adapt their capacity to the increased traffic. We intend to aggressively expand our wholesale offering as we see a number of benefits that we can achieve from doing so. Offering our excess capacity to other operators will reduce our subscriber acquisition costs, thereby helping to de-risk the commercial strategy of our core B2C and B2B businesses and discourage competitors from deploying their own FWA network, and instead having competitors rely on our state-of-the-art infrastructure. The resulting growth in the subscriber base should enable us to improve our network efficiency by utilizing available capacity with no impact on the connection quality for our customers. In addition, we believe that expanding our wholesale offering in areas where we are the sole provider of FWA services will help manage our churn rate as customers switching among operators hosted on our network will nevertheless continue to use our infrastructure. Additionally, we expect that by selling excess capacity to other operators and growing our wholesale business, we maximize the utilization of our asset base further benefitting from operating synergies. Prior to 2021, our wholesale distribution was limited only to B2B customers through the agreement signed with Wind 3 and other operators. Following the recently announced memorandum of understanding with TIM, we intend to expand our wholesale distribution to B2C customers. We intend to sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through other ISPs, system integrators and national (e.g., Retelit, Fastweb and Vianova) and international (e.g., Sparkle, NTT, Telefònica, Verizon, BT and AT&T) internet providers.

Every fiscal year a liability is recorded as a charge to the statement of profit and loss based on the estimated payout and trigger date. For the year ended March 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, as the sale process started in January 2021 and a sale had become probable prior to the original LTIP duration (2025), the valuation we performed in connection with the Acquisition triggered a significant accrual. The LTIP is expected to be replaced by a new Management Co-Investment Plan. It is expected that members of senior management will re-invest part of the proceeds received under the LTIP into the new Management Co-Investment Plan and/or in connection with the reinvestment related to the Acquisition. As the LTIP accrual was one-off, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan” and “Summary—The _Transactions—The Acquisition.”_ (d) _2020 institutional advertising campaign: represent the costs associated with an institutional and exceptional advertising campaign realized in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness towards authorities of the role that EOLO plays in the Italian internet connectivity landscape. As management considers this campaign as a one-off and connected to the fact that it was necessary to highlight the need for connectivity in Italy outside of large urban areas and their immediate environs which became more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (e) _Monitoring fees: represent the fees paid to our current shareholders for their consulting, monitoring and advisory services. Management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to illustrate the performance of the underlying business without giving effect to the shareholding structure which will change with the Acquisition. See “Summary—The Transactions—The _Acquisition.”_ (f) _Transactions costs: represent costs, including external M&A advisors and financial, commercial and legal due diligence fees and expenses, in respect of the Acquisition in 2021 and a new capital expenditure line signed in 2019. As these are one-off costs that were incurred in connection with extraordinary transactions, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (g) _Commission and activation fees: represent the net EBITDA contribution of new clients’ acquisition, including revenues for activation fees and sales commissions paid to our salesforce. Revenues for activation fees are deferred over the contract term agreed with the 97 ----- customer (mainly 24 months). Sales commissions are capitalized as “contract costs” since they are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract. They are recognized as operating expense over a period of 24 months consistent with the pattern of transfer of service to which they relate and the judgment that management applied in the revenue recognition policy. Most of our telecommunications competitors recognize such items in profit or loss over a longer period, based on their estimate of customers’ propensity to discontinue their subscriptions. For illustrative purposes, this adjustment applies such a convention assuming a period of time of seven years. Management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating our results of operations compared to our competitors. (h) _CPE installation related costs: our business requires CPEs, which are devices that enable consumers to access communication services and permit us to distribute our services. Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned customers in order to efficiently use our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of this adjustment: (i) installation costs for re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/substituting and upselling of CPEs associated with subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to relieve network bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then reconditioned and reused), and (iv) installation costs for activation “KO” which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation at potential new customers’ premises, where the subscription was aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the site (i.e., no line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). They represent relocation costs and therefore do not qualify for recognition as part of property, plant and equipment under IFRS. EOLO’s management considers such costs as part of the costs incurred for creation, improvement and maintenance of its infrastructure network and therefore added it back for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the above, EOLO’s management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating the operating results obtained through our infrastructure network. Moreover, the same adjustment is utilized in calculating Adjusted Capital Expenditure as described under footnote (3) to show the overall investment in our infrastructure network, with no impact on cash flows. (i) _Legacy ADSL business: this adjustment adds back the net negative EBITDA contribution associated with the ADSL business. ADSL represents a form of delivering broadband connectivity using telephone lines and is considered an obsolete technology that generally provides slower navigation and is more expensive to deliver than FWA technology, our core business. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 500 residual subscribers of ADSL services. We are actively encouraging ADSL subscribers to migrate to other technologies. Due to the fact that EOLO’s management will not further invest in ADSL technology, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA as it can assist investors in understanding EOLO’s core business. (j) _Other: mainly includes grants from Infratel on items that have been recognized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over time. In order to adjust for one-off and non-operating income items, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, for the year ended March 31, 2019, this line item includes the reversal of a payroll item that by its nature EOLO’s management believes is similar to the payroll expenses that were capitalized in the year ended March 31, 2019. (k) _Run-Rate impact: is calculated as the EBITDA that EOLO would have generated during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021 period if subscribers as of June 30, 2021 had been subscribers for the entire period, applying the Blended ARPU for the twelve months period to such subscriber base. Management considers that this adjustment shows, on an illustrative basis, the cash generation effect of new customer acquisitions driven by recent structural trends that have increased demand for high-speed connectivity. This further adjustment to Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had these new subscribers been acquired on July 1, 2020 nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying this adjustment are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering _Memorandum is based on estimates and assumptions in respect of certain adjustments which are subject to significant uncertainties.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

They relate to: a) CPEs which are installed only after the execution of a new contract with the client. If the client decides to terminate the contract, we charge a penalty to retrieve CPEs from a customer’s premises. The amount only includes capital expenditures invested for successful installations; b) BTS which are spent only after a network planning process has been established; and c) Increase data capacity. (2) Current Customer Base (“CCB”) Adjusted Capital Expenditures relate to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base (e.g. maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling toward 28GHz spectrum) and replacing churned customers with new activations. As a result of the factors discussed above under “—Results of Operations—Three months ended June 30, 2021 _compared to the three months June 30, 2020,” our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) decreased from_ €14.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to €2.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease of our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) was mainly driven by: Š _Post COVID-19 effect: in the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced significant subscriber growth driven by lockdown measures and increased demand of connectivity for smart working, distance learning and TV streaming, with relatively low advertising and marketing spend during such period. However, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded lower customer additions on the back of a temporarily stagnant market as a result of the gradual loosening of lockdown restrictions in Italy. This resulted in slower relative growth in total revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. The entire Italian BB market recorded lower subscriber growth during this period in 2021. By way of example, during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, subscriber net adds (i.e., the number of new subscribers minus churned customers) for the Italian BB market (only including TIM, Fastweb, Vodafone and EOLO) were 201,000 and 173,000 respectively, compared to 53,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2021. Š _Adjusted Capital Expenditures: during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we incurred a higher amount of Adjusted Capital Expenditures compared to the same period in the prior year (€36.2 million compared to €28.9 million). This increase was driven by (a) investments aimed at improving our network infrastructure, mainly as a result of the agreement signed in 2021 with Open Fiber to secure an additional 1,000 FTTA links; and (b) investments in BTS and CPE to increase our capacity and warehouse inventory in anticipation of the school re-opening in the fall as we typically do each year, other than in respect of the three months ended June 30, 2020, when the supply chain delays caused by COVID-19 led us to delay these investments. Our CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures increased from €12.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to €22.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to the allocation to CCB of the majority of the previously mentioned acceleration in network improvement and warehouse build up and because we had a larger customer base compared to the same period in the prior year. Our Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures on the other hand decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from €16.0 million to €14.2 million due to the lower net adds (7,300 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 25,500), which partially offset by the aforementioned investments in capacity expansion. We expect that these effects on our cashflow generation and composition of CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures versus Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures will normalize during the rest of the year ended March 31, 2022 following an expected increase in new subscriptions as we typically experience during the school re-opening season and the gradual utilization of the additional capacity built during the three months ended June 30, 2021. See “Forward-looking Statements.” 110 ----- More generally, we expect our Adjusted Capital Expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2022 to be consistent with the year ended March 31, 2021.

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control - at a point in time or over time - requires judgement. 112 ----- IFRS 15 requires that revenue be recognized using a five-step model: Š identify the contract(s) with a customer; Š identify the performance obligations in the contract; Š determine the transaction price; Š allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; Š recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. _Performance obligations and revenue recognition criteria_ The process underlying EOLO’s recognition of revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 is summarized below: Š the contract is identified when the parties approve the contract and identify their rights and obligations, _i.e., when the contract becomes legally binding;_ Š the duration of the contract with customer has been defined on the basis of the contract term agreed with the customer (mainly 24 months); Š EOLO has identified a single performance obligation for its connectivity services; it does not account for the performance obligations related to the other services provided with its connectivity services separately, as their separate accounting would not alter how it recognizes revenue; Š the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the customer, including any promotions, covering the entire contract term. Š EOLO allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling price. Revenue from nonrefundable up-front activation fees, which do not constitute a separate performance obligation and do not convey a material right to customers, is deferred over the contract term; Š EOLO recognizes revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. It usually invoices revenues and collects payment on a two-month basis in advance. Contracts with non-business customers generally provide for advance payment, which is not considered a significant financing component given that advance payment is normal business practice and average payments are usually made over less than 12 months. _Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil a contract_ The incremental costs of obtaining a contract, comprising commissions paid to agents and brokers, are recognized in profit or loss over the contract term (24 months). The costs to fulfil a contract, including the cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio transceiver at a new customer, are recognized over the contract term (24 months). The costs of initial installation are recognized in “Property, plant and equipment”. Should the contract be terminated, the incremental costs of obtaining the contract and the costs to fulfil it are expensed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Therefore, they are recognized at their purchase or production cost, including directly attributable costs and subsequently adjusted for accumulated depreciation, any accumulated impairment losses and/or reversals of impairment losses. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. 113 ----- Land is not depreciated, even when it is acquired together with a building. The gain or loss on the sale of property, plant, machinery, equipment or other assets is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized in profit or loss in the period of the derecognition. _Subsequent expenditure_ Subsequent expenditure and the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment are added to the item’s carrying amount and capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the related item increase. All other costs are expensed when incurred. When the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment is capitalized, the carrying amount of the parts that are replaced is expensed. The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed when incurred. _Depreciation_ Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is derecognized. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its estimated realizable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates: Š Buildings 3% Š Network systems and equipment 10% - 20% Š Assets under free loan 20% - 50% Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use EOLO’s connectivity services and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the related contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet depreciated is expensed These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated. Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment. When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant obsolescence, EOLO compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the present value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary. If the conditions for the recognition of the impairment loss are no longer valid in subsequent years, the loss is reversed up to the carrying amount the asset would have had (net of depreciation) had the impairment loss never been recognized. _Impairment losses on non-financial assets_ When a non-financial asset shows indication of impairment at the reporting date, EOLO estimates its recoverable amount, defined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, applying the following definitions: Š Value in use: this is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU). Specifically, the asset will generate cash flows, which will be discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. The cash flows are determined using internal business plans based on detailed 114 ----- budgets and calculations prepared separately for each asset/cash-generating unit. The budgets do not include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a horizon of a maximum of five years. Š Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. EOLO uses valuation models based on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, EOLO recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, EOLO checks whether the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if not, estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of goodwill, if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years. The reversal is recognized through profit or loss. At the lease commencement date, EOLO recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. EOLO measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, EOLO uses its incremental borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest, reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or when EOLO changes its assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. EOLO’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to: Š physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals; Š multi-year rights to use fiber optic sections (dark fiber IRU); Š office buildings; Š company cars; Š data center equipment and other assets (canteen equipment). EOLO elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Therefore, it recognizes the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term. EOLO assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under the new definition of IFRS 16, which establishes that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. 115 ----- EOLO recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in the statement of financial position. EOLO recognizes right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in the specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease liabilities” in the statement of financial position. EOLO has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the carrying amount of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. It measures the right-of-use asset considering the amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the date of initial recognition. EOLO depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers title to the underlying asset at the end of the lease term or, given the cost of the right-of-use asset, EOLO expects to exercise the purchase option. In this case, EOLO depreciates the right-of-use asset over its useful life determined using the same criteria as per property, plant and equipment. Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognized in accordance with IAS 36— Impairment of assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount rates do not reflect the risks for which future cash flows have been adjusted. EOLO regularly reviews the provisions to reflect changes in the estimate of the costs, the payment/settlement timing and the discount rate. Changes in the estimates are recognized in the same caption of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the provision or, when the liability relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, as a balancing entry to the related asset.

The BTS act as a radio link between the distribution network and the customer premise. BTS are generally shared between multiple users but occasionally can be fully dedicated to a single client in case of specific capacity requirements (e.g., large business customers). Transmission towers are connected via radio or fiber backhauls: ‰ _Radio Backhauling. Our radio backhauling provides point-to-point (“PTP”) radio links. It represents a fast and cost-effective solution, requiring the sole installation of microwave equipment (i.e., transceiver and parabolic antenna) on the two BTS to be interconnected (under the condition that the parabolic antennas are in line of sight). As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600 radio links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately 41% compared to 2018). ‰ _Fiber Backhauling. Our fiber backhauling provides direct fiber connections which brings higher capacity and availability compared to our radio links. Direct fiber connections are typically realized on BTS representing a central hub or a root within the network topology, or to close a network ring (eliminating single point of failure in the backhauling network). Our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 FTTA links to BTS. See “—Our Facilities.” We use the 26 GHz (24.5-26.5 GHz) and 6-11-18-80 GHz frequencies for our distribution network.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The CPEs are installed on customers’ premises and act as radio terminal antenna, communicating with the BTS to provide internet service. Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’ architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. Our main providers of radio access equipment are the American company, Cambium Networks Ltd (“Cambium”) and the Greek company, Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions (“Intracom”). This equipment can provide either PTP (generally for 150 ----- TOP Subscribers) or point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) connections. Our main access technologies which connect the BTS to the rooftop CPEs are: ‰ _EOLO Wave. EOLO Wave is the FWA broadband service which leverages the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum (or 3.5 GHz in Valle d’Aosta). We have leveraged outdoor multi-user, multiple input, multiple output technology on our 5GHz network since 2015, allowing capacity increase under the same amount of spectrum and a better beam directionality, which renders the radio link more efficient. EOLO Wave provides a maximum speed of 30Mbps and a coverage range of approximately €20 kilometers from the BTS. We have built a sophisticated management system around this technology, allowing the network to achieve a high level of scalability and therefore to support the service quality overall. CPEs using the 5GHz spectrum have a cost of €172. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 76% of our customers relied on our EOLO Wave solution. _EOLO Wave G. EOLO Wave G is the ultra-broadband FWA service using millimetric waves_ based on the 28 GHz licensed spectrum. We launched EOLO Wave G in 2017 to offer the first 100 Mbps FWA product, basically a worldwide prima. Due to the electromagnetic characteristics of the millimetric waves, the 28 GHz network design requires for tighter tolerances compared to networks based on lower frequencies. This has led us to adopt a control and validation process of 28 GHz implementation by working with dedicated measuring tools that ascertains the correct tilt and azimuth of the panel. This innovation has led to a higher quality level of the installations, not only for 28 GHz networks, but also for the rest of our network based on the 5 GHz frequency. Compared to EOLO Wave which uses the 5 GHz spectrum (an unlicensed band), EOLO Wave G uses the licensed 28 GHz spectrum, minimizing the external interferences and allowing us to improve the signal to noise ratio (the ratio of signal power to the noise power). EOLO Wave G provides a maximum speed of 100Mbps (up to 1 Gbps for selected customers) and a coverage range of approximately €5 kilometers from the BTS. CPEs using the 28GHz spectrum have a cost of €366. As of June 30, 2021, 23% of our customers relied on our EOLO Wave G solution.

LuxCo will own 75% of the share capital of HoldCo, while Cometa will hold the remaining 25%. Funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group will initially hold the entire issued share capital of LuxCo. On or after the Acquisition Closing Date, SCP EPC UK Limited, which is a Seller and a vehicle managed by Searchlight Capital Partners L.P., may reinvest for a stake of up to approximately 10% to 15% of Luxco or a holding company thereof. Certain governance and other rights of the shareholders in HoldCo will be governed by the Shareholder Agreement. See “Principal Shareholders—the Shareholder Agreement.” On or following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Sponsor plans to implement a management incentive participation program for certain directors, managers and officers of the Group to subscribe for certain equity instruments of Holdco. See “Certain Relationships and _Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan.”_ (2) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €125.0 million. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The initial borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the Issuer. Under_ the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to applicable laws, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. We currently expect that the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing Date. (3) The Notes will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to certain perfection requirements, by the Escrowed Property. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Completion Collateral. Within 20 Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Completion Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any) on a pari passu basis. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to applicable laws, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders 22 ----- under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any subsidiary permitted to be incurred and secured by such Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The security interests in the Collateral will be limited by applicable law and subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances. Although future subsidiaries of MergerCo may be required to grant note guarantees in the future under certain circumstances as described under “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants—Future Guarantees,” as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not expected that the Notes will be guaranteed if the Post-Completion Merger is completed. For further information, see “Description of _the Notes—Security,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ (4) On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will make the Funding Loan with a portion of the proceeds under Tranche B (as defined under “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to enable the Target to refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness and pay related fees and expenses, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantee and the Collateral—The principal amount of the Funding Loan may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain indebtedness of the Target prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.” We expect that (i) the Rolled Target Indebtedness in a_ principal amount of €15.9 million and (ii) certain lease liabilities in a principal amount of €89.2 million will remain outstanding following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Rolled Target _Indebtedness.” The proceeds from the Funding Loan will be used by the Target as described under “Use of Proceeds.” The amount of the_ Funding Loan is estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and may change depending on several factors, including the timing of the Acquisition Closing Date. (5) The Transactions will be primarily financed with (i) proceeds from the Offering in an aggregate principal amount of €375.0 million and (ii) €910.1 million of shareholder funding in the form of (a) an equity contribution to be provided by HoldCo to the Issuer (in the amount of €182.0 million) and (b) a deeply subordinated and non-interest bearing shareholder loan by HoldCo to the Issuer for an amount of €728.1 million (the “Shareholder Loan”). The Shareholder Loan will be entered into on or about the Acquisition Closing Date and it will be governed by Italian Law. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Shareholder Loan, (i) the Issuer and HoldCo will agree that all their rights under the Shareholder Loan will be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and that, prior to the maturity date thereof, the Issuer shall only be permitted to make a payment due under the Shareholder Loan to the extent such payment is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable finance documents (including the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Shareholder Loan will be subordinated to the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future liabilities of the Issuer, and (iii) the Shareholder Loan shall be subordinated to all current and future financial and non-financial liabilities of the Issuer, including with respect to trade creditors. (6) The Issuer is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni). The Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions, the management of the Target following the Acquisition and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with the Target in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law and as further described herein, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of the Notes—Post-Completion _Merger.” The Post-Completion Merger will be subject to certain conditions and requirements and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” As of the Issue Date, the Target has no subsidiaries and therefore, following the Post-_ Completion Merger, MergerCo is not expected to have any subsidiaries and to be the sole obligor under the Indenture. (7) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. In the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date. See “Description of the _Notes—Guarantee.” Following the Acquisition Closing Date and prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post_ Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target (if any). After the Post-Completion Merger, no future subsidiary (if any) of MergerCo is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of any future subsidiaries of MergerCo or the Target, as the case may be. The Guarantee will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and may_ be subject to release under certain circumstances.

The Guarantee will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency _Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The_ 25 ----- _Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantee and the _Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral.”_ See _“Description_ _of_ _Certain_ Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ and “Description of the Notes—Guarantee.” Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . . . . .** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will, if and when granted: - be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor’s Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade creditors) of the subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes; and - be subject to the limitations described under “Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_ Security** On the Issue Date, subject to certain perfection requirements, the Notes will only be secured by the Escrowed Property, on a first priority basis. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the Completion Collateral. Within 20 Business Days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the PostCompletion Collateral. Each of the Escrowed Property, the Completion Collateral and the Post-Completion Collateral is further described under “Description of _the Notes—Security.” The Collateral will also secure the obligations_ of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any). In the event of an enforcement in respect of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such 26 ----- Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee _and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and_ _counterparties_ _to_ _certain_ _hedging_ _obligations_ _and_ _future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_ _and_ _enforceability,”_ and “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. In addition, the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. For more information on the security interests granted, see “Description of the Notes—Security” and for more information on potential limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency _Law_ _Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _the_ _Validity_ _and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ Post-Completion Merger . . . . . . . . . . .** Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/ or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with the Target in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of the Notes—Certain _Covenants—The Post-Completion Merger.” The Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon release from escrow, the gross proceeds from the Offering will be used, together with the Shareholder Funding and, as applicable, cash on the Target’s balance sheet, to (i) finance the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (iv) fund cash to the Target’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus a “make whole” premium, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in 27 ----- each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, prior to, 2024, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after , 2024, at the relevant redemption prices described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Withholding Taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Except as provided in “Description of the Notes”, all payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes or other governmental charges in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction unless required by law. If withholding or deduction for, on account of, such taxes is required to be made by law with respect to any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer with respect to any Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction (the “Additional **Amounts”).** See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the _Notes—Withholding Taxes” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any_ additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 except, in the case of Decree No. 239 and Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or their agents. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Although we believe that, under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of the Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (as identified currently in Ministerial Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and supplemented and, in the future, any decree to be issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239; any such decree, the “White List” and such holder of the Notes complies with certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or in Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including any change in the White List. See “Certain _tax _considerations—Certain Italian tax considerations.”_ Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law (or in its interpretation) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become effective on or after the Issue Date and, as a result, the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price 28 ----- of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.” Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of the Notes if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In connection with certain tender offers for either series of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer, in any case not below par.

We define “Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the full period effect of new subscribers as of June 30, 2021 as described below. Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to net profit/(loss), as measures of our operating performance, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as measures of our ability to meet our cash needs or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Given certain one-off transactions that have had a significant impact on EOLO S.p.A.’s profit or loss statement, the growth in our subscriber base and the extensive investments in network expansion that have been made during the periods under review, EOLO’s management monitors Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of internal capital allocation decision-making and budget planning. Each of the adjustments comprising Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is further described in the footnotes below. These Non-IFRS Measures are presented in this Offering Memorandum because EOLO’s management believes that they can assist readers to understand the underlying dynamics of the core business operations of EOLO S.p.A., and that they provide meaningful and relevant financial information that is useful in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s operations in the same manner as management views and operates the business. EOLO’s management presents the foregoing Non-IFRS Measures because similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations and ability to service debt. However, such Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Readers are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons EOLO’s 34 ----- management consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis and not in substitute of our results of operations and statement of cash flows reported under IFRS.

For purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA, management performed this adjustment in order to illustrate the performance of our business as it evolves with the changes in our subscriber base over the periods under review. (b) _Impairment losses on non-current assets: refers to the reduction in the value of our certain assets within property, plant and equipment due to obsolescence. As a non-cash effect, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA to better illustrate the performance associated with our business. (c) _LTIP: represents the accrual of the award to senior management of one-off payments under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in place prior to the Transactions. The LTIP had an original timeframe up to 2025 and contemplated a one off payment to senior management linked to specific, pre-agreed liquidity events such the sale of EOLO. Every fiscal year a liability is recorded as a charge to the statement of profit and loss based on the estimated payout and trigger date. For the year ended March 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, as the sale process started in January 2021 and a sale had become probable prior to the original LTIP duration (2025), the valuation we performed in connection with the Acquisition triggered a significant accrual. The LTIP is expected to be replaced by a new Management Co-Investment Plan. It is expected that members of senior management will re-invest part of the proceeds received under the LTIP into the new Management Co-Investment Plan and/or in connection with the reinvestment related to the Acquisition. As the LTIP accrual was one-off, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan” and “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.” (d) _2020 institutional advertising campaign: represent the costs associated with an institutional and exceptional advertising campaign realized in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness towards authorities of the role that EOLO plays in the Italian internet connectivity landscape. As management considers this campaign as a one-off and connected to the fact that it was necessary to highlight the need for connectivity in Italy outside of large urban areas and their immediate environs which became more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (e) _Monitoring fees: represent the fees paid to our current shareholders for their consulting, monitoring and advisory services. Management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to illustrate the performance of the underlying business without giving effect to the shareholding structure which will change with the Acquisition. See “Summary—The _Transactions—The Acquisition.”_ 35 ----- (f) _Transactions costs: represent costs, including external M&A advisors and financial, commercial and legal due diligence fees and expenses, in respect of the Acquisition in 2021 and a new capital expenditure line signed in 2019. As these are one-off costs that were incurred in connection with extraordinary transactions, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (g) _Commission and activation fees: represent the net EBITDA contribution of new clients’ acquisition, including revenues for activation fees and sales commissions paid to our salesforce. Revenues for activation fees are deferred over the contract term agreed with the customer (mainly 24 months). Sales commissions are capitalized as “contract costs” since they are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract. They are recognized as operating expense over a period of 24 months consistent with the pattern of transfer of service to which they relate and the judgment that management applied in the revenue recognition policy. Most of our telecommunications competitors recognize such items in profit or loss over a longer period, based on their estimate of customers’ propensity to discontinue their subscriptions. For illustrative purposes, this adjustment applies such a convention assuming a period of time of seven years. Management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating our results of operations compared to our competitors. (h) _CPE installation related costs: our business requires CPEs, which are devices that enable consumers to access communication services and permit us to distribute our services. Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned customers in order to efficiently use our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of this adjustment: (i) installation costs for re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/substituting and upselling of CPEs associated with subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to relieve network bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then reconditioned and reused), and (iv) installation costs for activation “KO” which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation at potential new customers’ premises, where the subscription was aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the site (i.e., no line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). They represent relocation costs and therefore do not qualify for recognition as part of property, plant and equipment under IFRS. EOLO’s management considers such costs as part of the costs incurred for creation, improvement and maintenance of its infrastructure network and therefore added it back for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the above, EOLO’s management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating the operating results obtained through our infrastructure network. Moreover, the same adjustment is utilized in calculating Adjusted Capital Expenditure as described under footnote (3) to show the overall investment in our infrastructure network, with no impact on cash flows. (i) _Legacy ADSL business: this adjustment adds back the net negative EBITDA contribution associated with the ADSL business. ADSL represents a form of delivering broadband connectivity using telephone lines and is considered an obsolete technology that generally provides slower navigation and is more expensive to deliver than FWA technology, our core business. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 500 residual subscribers of ADSL services. We are actively encouraging ADSL subscribers to migrate to other technologies. Due to the fact that EOLO’s management will not further invest in ADSL technology, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA as it can assist investors in understanding EOLO’s core business. (j) _Other: mainly includes grants from Infratel on items that have been recognized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over time. In order to adjust for one-off and non-operating income items, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, for the year ended March 31, 2019, this line item includes the reversal of a payroll item that by its nature EOLO’s management believes is similar to the payroll expenses that were capitalized in the year ended March 31, 2019. (k) _Run-Rate impact: is calculated as the EBITDA that EOLO would have generated during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021 period if subscribers as of June 30, 2021 had been subscribers for the entire period, applying the Blended ARPU for the twelve months period to such subscriber base. Management considers that this adjustment shows, on an illustrative basis, the cash generation effect of new customer acquisitions driven by recent structural trends that have increased demand for high-speed connectivity. This further adjustment to Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had these new subscribers been acquired on July 1, 2020 nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying this adjustment are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Run-Rate _Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum is based on estimates and assumptions in respect of certain adjustments which are subject to significant uncertainties.”_ (2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin are defined as Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA _divided by total revenue and other income, expressed as a percentage, as applicable._ (3) We define “Adjusted Capital Expenditures” as Total Capital Expenditures (which is the sum of acquisitions of intangible assets and acquisitions of property, plant and equipment as reported in accordance with IFRS) as adjusted for the capitalization of CPE related installation capital expenditures, IRU lease costs, disposals, other sundry items and other minor items. Adjusted Capital Expenditures is not a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted Capital Expenditures as an alternative to cash flows used in investing activities or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. See “Presentation _of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_ Given the extensive investments in network expansion that have been made during the periods under review, management monitors Adjusted Capital Expenditures for purposes of evaluating the allocation of capital and planning network expansion and tracing payoff of investments which combines a capitalized and operating expenditure view. Each of the adjustments comprising Adjusted Capital Expenditure is further described in the footnotes below. 36 ----- The following table reconciles our Total Capital Expenditures (which is the sum of acquisitions of intangible assets and acquisitions of property, plant and equipment as reported in accordance with IFRS) to Adjusted Capital Expenditures for each of the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned customers in order to efficiently use our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of this adjustment: (i) installation costs for re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/ substituting and upselling of CPEs associated with subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to relieve network bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then reconditioned and reused), and (iv) costs related to “KO” installations which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation at potential new customers’ premises, where the subscription was aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the site (i.e., no line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). In order for EOLO’s management to track expenditure by nature and benchmark the efficiency of its investments and allocations of cash, and to assist readers in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s expenditures during the periods under review, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment to Total Capital Expenditures. See footnote (1) above for more information on this adjustment. (b) _IRU leases: costs related to IRU Contracts which are multi-year rights to use fiber optic (dark fiber). They represent leases under IFRS 16 and cannot be capitalized. IRU lease costs, however, expand with the expansion of our network. In order to model its expenditure, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted Capital Expenditures. (c) _Other: consists of other sundry items that, due to their nature, management considers appropriate to present as part of Adjusted Capital Expenditures as they are related to network expansion. (d) _Other Minor: consists of inventory disposals and certain other minor expenditures which are ancillary to management of our asset base and/or network expansion. (4) We define “Operating Free Cash Flow” as net cash flows generated by operating activities as reported in accordance with IFRS as adjusted for CPE installation related cash flow, the variation attributable to the phasing of certain Adjusted Capital Expenditure-related payables and other items. We define “Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth)” as Operating Free Cash Flow as further adjusted for hosting lease payments, other operating items and CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures. None of Operating Free Cash Flow or Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Operating Free Cash Flow or Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) as alternatives to net cash flows generated by operating activities or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— _Non-IFRS Measures.”_ EOLO’s management believes that Operating Free Cash Flow is a useful Non-IFRS Measure to use in evaluating business performance and to inform future expenditure planning because it illustrates cash generation on a basis that is comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure, permitting EOLO’s management to analyze the business in a consistent manner. Furthermore, EOLO’s management believes that or Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a relevant Non-IFRS Measure that can assist in capital allocation and planning operating and capital expenditures based on ability of the business to generate cash. Each of the adjustments comprising Operating Free Cash Flow and Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is further described in the footnotes below. 37 ----- The following table reconciles our net cash flows generated by operating activities as reported in accordance with IFRS to Operating Free Cash Flow and Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) for each of the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

EOLO’s management performed this adjustment in order to, inter alia, model the cash flow effect of our re-use/repair/substitution/upselling of CPEs, which is a pillar of EOLO S.p.A.’s strategy. (b) _Phasing of Adjusted Capital Expenditures: relates to the cash outflow attributable to days payable outstanding (typically between 60-90 days) of Adjusted Capital Expenditures as the payment for the capital expenditures may be made in another period than the recording of the expenditure. In order to facilitate comparison over period for budgetary and expenditure planning purposes, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Operating Free Cash Flow. (c) _Other: relates mostly to grants from Infratel. For accounting purposes, the recognition of the amount of the grants received are typically accounted based on the amortization of the related capital expenditure. In order to illustrate the cash inflows of the business, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Operating Free Cash Flow. (d) _Hosting lease payments: the coverage of our FWA network depends in part on our ability to maintain existing BTS and to build up new BTS for our network. Our BTS are generally installed on towers owned by third parties, the use of which is secured by way of lease agreements.

Our operating licenses or authorizations specify radio bandwidths that we can use to transmit data. The terms of our licenses and frequency allocations are established by the MED and the AGCOM and, in some cases, are subject to modification or early termination (with the confirmation of the right for the following period with the payment of the contributions due in advance). We currently have the right to use the following frequencies: 26 GHz, 28 GHz, 3.5 GHz (only in the Valle D’Aosta region) and 6-11-13-18-80 GHz. Rights to use frequencies are subject to term limits and must be renewed from time to time. Applicable law requires that authorities conduct an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure which, among others: (a) take into account the fulfilment of the objectives of the Directive 2018/1972 (e.g., promote connectivity, access to competition, efficiency, harmonization); (b) give all interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation; and (c) clearly state the reasons for such possible renewal. In particular, our 26 GHz (used for our distribution network) and 28 GHz (used for our access network) licenses, expire on December 31, 2022. We filed a request for extension on July 8, 2019 for our 28 GHz license and on February 12, 2021 for our 26 GHz license and the procedures for the extension are currently expected to be finalized by end of 2021 and by the first quarter of 2022, respectively. If we fail to renew any of our licenses, permits, rights to use or other authorizations we may lose the ability to continue to operate the relevant business and the realizable value of our relevant network infrastructure and related assets may be materially adversely affected. The procedure to obtain licenses, permits, rights to use or other authorizations (and renewals thereof) may be complex lengthy and may require ongoing compliance with various obligations. Moreover, even if we obtain the renewal of our licenses, permits, right to use or authorizations, the costs for obtaining those might be higher than those we expect. Finally, if we fail to comply with the requirements of the applicable legislation and regulatory framework in general, which is very detailed and complex in nature, or we fail to meet any of the terms of the licenses, our licenses necessary for our operations may be suspended or terminated or significant fines imposed. See “—Our business is capital _intensive. It cannot be assumed that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs or our on-going operations in the future.”_ In addition, we are authorized by the MED to provide the following electronic communications services: a General authorization for the supply of electronic communications network and services, issued on July 28, 2014; General Authorization for Internet Service (ISP), pursuant to an authorization issued on November 11, 2006; WISP (IFI Internet Service Provider), pursuant to an authorization issued on July 15, 2005; and VOIP (Voice over IP), pursuant to an authorization issued on May 29, 2006 (together, the “General Authorizations”). The General Authorizations were granted for a period of 20 years. The procedure for the extension of the General Authorizations similar to the procedure for the renewal of the licenses. We have in the past applied and, will in the future apply, to the MED to obtain the renewal of the General Authorizations but there can be no assurance, that any application for the renewal of one or more of the General Authorizations upon their expiration will be successful or the renewal will be granted on equivalent or satisfactory terms. Although we have a dedicated team tasked with obtaining, monitoring compliance with, and renewing the required licenses, permits and other authorizations, due to the inherent challenges of these regimes, we may experience difficulties in obtaining, complying with, and securing the renewal of necessary licenses, permits and 41 ----- authorizations. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to find and implement feasible alternatives to using these licenses, permits and authorizations, may incur substantial costs in doing so, and may be subject to fines or penalties. As a consequence, we may operate our FWA network on a limited basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Similarly, the build-out and operation of our FWA network and/or regulatory authorities, particularly in relation to rights of way. These approvals and permits may include building, construction and environmental permits, antenna and mast deployment approvals and various other planning permissions. Obtaining these approvals and permits can be a complex process. Our network was supported by approximately 3,400 BTS as of August 31, 2021. Given the multitude of regulations that govern such equipment and the various permits required to operate our network, we cannot be certain that our right to use a portion of our transmission system will not be challenged. Operating a BTS without the required permits could result in fines or legal proceedings seeking to have the BTS removed. Furthermore, local residents may challenge our right to operate a BTS regardless of whether or not we have obtained the requisite permits and authorizations. The loss of the right to use a material number of BTS or any strategically located BTS could have a disruptive effect on the operation of our FWA network in a service area.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534
624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"The success of our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If we are unable to successfully manage our subscriber turnover or otherwise lose subscribers, we may face reduced revenues or lower cash flows.","Our ability to attract and retain subscribers for our FWA offering in our Core TAM is uncertain and will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, among others, the business strategies and capabilities of our competitors, prevailing market conditions, the development of new and/or alternate technologies for fixed telecommunications products and services and the effect of applicable regulations. Our ability to attract new subscribers or to grow our Blended ARPU from existing subscribers will depend in large part upon our ability to offer high quality and attractively priced services, stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers to switch from competing operators to our FWA services and our ability to manage churn. A small portion of our subscribers are prepaid, which also contributes to churn, as these subscribers are not contractually bound in the long-term to use our services and are free to move to other operators with more attractive pricing or other advantages. If we fail to reduce or maintain our rates of churn, or competing operators improve their ability to retain subscribers and thereby lower their churn levels, our cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to attract new subscribers may also be negatively affected by a slowdown in the Italian economy and the European economy as a whole. See “—Our business, financial condition, results of operations _and liquidity may be adversely affected by disruptive geopolitical or macroeconomic events and economic uncertainty in Italy.”_ In addition, customer support services help us build and maintain good relationships with our customers, which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. We believe that our delivery and installation activities are a crucial element in allowing our distribution and service channels to meet customer expectations and drive revenue growth. We rely on a consolidated and trusted team of approximately 600 local contractor companies and 1,500 external technicians and 30 internal technicians as of March 31, 2021. If our internal team or our external specialists do not provide adequate levels of assistance to our customers (including in the installation phase), our customer satisfaction levels may decline and our churn rate may increase, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534
624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.3,Our operations depend on our ability to efficiently operate our systems and controls that are subject to failure that could affect our business and our reputation.,"Our success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our controls, network technology systems and of certain hardware. Our technical infrastructure (including our network infrastructure and information technology) is vulnerable to damage or, among other things, interruption from information and telecommunication technology failures, power loss, floods, windstorms, fires, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing, human error and similar events. For example, we currently operate one data center facility for our core network infrastructure, with one backup recovery facility; the disruption of these facilities could adversely impact our FWA network. In addition, an unexpected increase in volume on our network and systems could cause them to 42 ----- malfunction, such as in periods of increased demand or unexpected circumstances that may reduce our ability to service our infrastructure. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased demand for streamed entertainment and online working and learning led to an increased demand for reliable and fast connectivity significantly, which in turn led to an unexpected network overload, which resulted in more frequent technical issues and a lower quality of service delivered to customers. Our controls are dependent on these technological systems and are also subject to the interruptions and failures. Unanticipated problems with our controls, or at our facilities, system failures, hardware or software failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of our services and cause service interruptions. Any of these occurrences could result in reduced user traffic and reduced revenue and could harm our levels of customer satisfaction, our reputation and compliance with certain of our regulatory obligations. Sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to our growth and our ability to monitor costs, render monthly invoices, process customer orders, provide customer service and achieve operating efficiencies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully operate and upgrade our information and processing systems or that they will continue to perform as expected without any failure. A severe failure in our accounting, information and processing systems could impair our ability to collect payments from customers and respond satisfactorily to customer needs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Additionally, our network requires ongoing investment to avoid obsolescence.","The wireless broadband market is characterized by technological change in existing systems and industry standards combined with ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of technology to cater to changing customer needs. Our commercial success depends in part on providing B2C and B2B services addressing different user needs. If we are unable to anticipate customer preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may fail to attract customers or lose existing customers. Many of the services we offer are technology-intensive and the development or acceptance of new technologies may render such services non-competitive and/or obsolete, replace such services or reduce prices for such services. As new technologies develop, our equipment, such as our CPE, may need to be replaced or upgraded, we may need to acquire additional licenses and our FWA network may need to be rebuilt in whole or in part in order to sustain our competitive position. To respond successfully to technological advances, we may require additional capital expenditures and access to related or enabling technologies in order to integrate the new technology with our existing technology. In particular, while we have been working to develop our 5G NR mobile network and our own BTS router, there is a risk that we may fail to successfully implement these innovations or may fail to do so in a timely manner, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. See “Business—Research and _Development.”_ As the convergence of telecommunications services accelerates, we have made and will have to continue to make substantial additional investments in new technologies to remain competitive, and changes in technology and services may also lead us to competing with new competitors including both emerging players as well as established technology companies entering new sectors and bundling technologies as a means of increasing their competitive advantage. Our business and results of operations will also suffer if our new services are not responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, are not effectively brought to market or are not priced competitively. The new technologies we choose may not prove to be commercially successful or profitable. We cannot be certain that existing, proposed or as yet undeveloped technologies will not become dominant in the future and render the technologies we use less commercially viable or profitable or that we will be successful in responding in a timely and cost-effective way to keep up with new developments. As telecommunications technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer telecommunications products and services that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar or better than those offered by us. At the time we select and advance one technology over another, it may not be possible to accurately predict which technology may prove to be the most economical, efficient or capable of attracting subscribers or stimulating usage and we may develop or implement a technology that does not achieve widespread commercial success or that is not compatible with other newly developed technologies. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we are not successful in anticipating and responding to technological change and resulting customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our quality of services, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 43 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

For the year ended March 31, 2021, we reported cash flow generated by operating activities of €91.6 million, while our Total Capital Expenditures was €103.1 million. In order to continue to acquire new customers and expand our business in our Target Market, we will continue to require significant capital outlays in the foreseeable future, including the continued build-out, maintenance and optimization of our network and expansion of our coverage and the improvement of our ultra-broadband services. We may also need to invest in new networks and technologies in the future, which could require significant capital expenditures and, if network usage develops faster than we anticipate, we may require greater capital investments in shorter time frames than it anticipates and we may not have the resources to make such investments. In addition, costs associated with the licenses that we need in order to operate our existing networks and technologies (and those that we may develop in the future), and costs and rental expenses related to their deployment, could be significant. For example, we have filed a request for extension on July 8, 2019 for our 28 GHz license and on February 12, 2021 for our 26 GHz license and the procedures for the extension are currently expected to be finalized by end of 2021 and by the first quarter of 2022, respectively. We expect that the amounts to secure renewals of our 28 GHz and 26 GHz licenses, will be higher than those paid during the 2014, 2016 and 2018 tender procedures. Our ability to generate cash flow and to finance our capital expenditures, current operations and debt service obligations depends on numerous factors, including: ‰ our future operating performance; ‰ the demand and price levels for our current and projected products and services; ‰ our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and the subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to our networks; ‰ our ability to successfully introduce new products and services; ‰ our ability to limit customer churn; ‰ the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending; ‰ competition; and ‰ legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business. The amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may also be required to raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these measures on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms compared to our competitors, if at all. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to meet our capital expenditure needs, sustain our operations or meet our other capital requirements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Under Decree No. 231, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse) in our interest or for our benefit, by individuals having a functional relationship with us, including third party agents or intermediaries. In such circumstances, we could be subject to economic sanctions (fines and confiscation of profits) and legal sanctions 44 ----- which could include: (i) prohibition from continuing the business affected by the criminal offenses; (ii) suspension and revocation of current or future authorizations, licenses or concessions; (iii) prohibition from contracting with public authorities; (iv) exclusion from subsidies, loans contributions or, where applicable, the revocation of those already granted; and (v) prohibition on publicizing goods or services. The duration of these disqualifications range from a minimum of three months to a maximum of two years (in very serious cases, however, some of these disqualifications can be applied permanently in the worst scenario). The abovementioned legal sanctions may also be applied as interim measures, even during the investigations phase. As an alternative to the legal sanctions, the court may appoint a judicial custodian to run the company, with the consequence that the profits gained during the receivership period are automatically confiscated. Although we maintain and implement internal anti-corruption controls and policies (including the internal control model pursuant to Decree No. 231 and related procedures) and a specific Supervisory Body (Organismo di Vigilanza) appointed pursuant to Decree No. 231 performs its supervisory and monitoring functions, we may also be liable if we are not able to detect or prevent every instance of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our employees or agents in the future and it is determined that our internal anti-corruption controls and policies are inadequate or are not effectively implemented. In particular, EOLO and certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are currently involved in certain criminal proceedings stemming from a complaint filed by one of our competitors, Linkem S.p.A. on October 14, 2016 (the “Criminal Proceeding”). EOLO has been investigated for administrative liability according to the Decree No. 231 with reference to: (i) the criminal offence of aggravated fraud against the Italian State; and (ii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this second charge was dismissed by the court in November 2019). The Public Prosecutor of Busto Arsizio alleged that EOLO’s procedures were inadequate to detect and prevent the managers’ alleged behaviors and would have generated for EOLO an undue profit of approximately €3.5 million between 2016 and 2017. On January 25, 2021, the Public Prosecutor issued, among others, a motion to dismiss for the aforementioned charges of aggravated fraud against EOLO’s managers and the understanding of our counsel is that the Public Prosecutor is determined to order the dismissal of the said charges against EOLO as well once the competent court decides on the request for dismissal against the former and current managers of EOLO. The offence of aggravated fraud against the Italian State is sanctioned with: ‰ Fines of up to €774,500, which might be further increased up to a maximum amount of €929,400 in case of significant profits obtained from the crime or serious damages caused by the crime; ‰ Ban measures (for a period ranging from three months to two years): (a) prohibition of contracting with the Italian government except for obtaining a public service; (b) exclusion from public funding and contributions and revocation of those previously granted; (c) prohibition from advertising goods and services; and ‰ Mandatory disgorgement of the profits of the crime, or of an equivalent sum of money and assets. Although we believe that we have already implemented certain self-cleaning measures (e.g., we have strengthened our system, including applicable controls and procedures under Decree No. 231) and our legal counsel advised us that a guilty verdict can be considered as remote scenario considering the whole elements under analysis and the current status of the proceeding, we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome of the Criminal Proceeding against EOLO will be and we could be subject to the above sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.

Any contact by our directors, employees or agents with public administration organizations as well as with private individuals, under certain circumstances, involves risks associated with, among others, fraud, bribery, corruption and other fraudulent activities by our employees and related investigations. Furthermore, we are exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents could commit IT related crimes, which may consist in violating our IT systems or those of our competitors, unlawful access to banking data (including that of our customers) and damages to IT systems and documents. 45 ----- Our employees and third party installers on EOLO’s behalf deliver services within buildings, for specific fixed assets (i.e., telecommunications equipment) and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized use of the customer’s property, unauthorized entry or breach of security protocols, negligence or willful misconduct or other tortious acts by our employees or people who have gained unauthorized access to premises through us. Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for us. Accordingly, these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are currently involved in the Criminal Proceeding. See “—We are subject to Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal _persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the state, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.” Our CEO and other former and_ current managers have been investigated for (i) aggravated theft of unauthorized radio-frequencies (ii) aggravated fraud against the Italian State; and (iii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this third charge was dismissed by the court in November 2019). Although on January 25 2021, the Public Prosecutor issued a motion to dismiss the allegations of aggravated theft and aggravated fraud against EOLO’s managers, on February 15, 2021 Linkem S.p.A. filed an opposition to the request for dismissal. The offences of aggravated theft and fraud against the Italian State are sanctioned with: ‰ Imprisonment from two to six years for aggravated theft and a fine from €206.00 to €1,594.00, imprisonment from one to seven years for aggravated fraud a and fine from €309.00 to €2,065.03; ‰ Ban measures: ban from contracting with the Italian government for a period up to five years; and/or ‰ Disgorgement of the crime’s profits. Although our legal counsel has advised us that the risk that the competent court will not authorize the dismissal can be considered as remote given the whole elements under analysis and the current status of the proceeding, our current managers (including our CEO) could be subject to the above sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Business—Legal _and Regulatory Proceedings.” and “—We are subject to Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.”_ In addition, if the Criminal Proceeding will continue its course against EOLO’s managers, EOLO might be summoned as entity liable for damages caused by the crime committed by such managers. In such case, should such managers be convicted, EOLO might be required to compensate the damages, jointly with the convicted natural persons. Furthermore, a conviction of EOLO’s managers for the Criminal Proceeding may entail a risk on the possible participation of EOLO to public tender processes. According to art. 80 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 50/2016 (Italian Code of Public Contracts), the final (i.e. non-appealable) conviction for certain crimes (including the aggravated fraud against the Italian State) referring to the members of the board of directors, the holders of a power of attorney and persons with powers of representation, direction and control generally, including technical directors (including also persons whose office ended in the year before the publication of the tender notice) represents an automatic cause of exclusion from public tendering procedures, while a non-final conviction or a pending trial for the aforementioned crimes may represent a discretionary cause of exclusion from tendering procedures to be evaluated on a case by case basis by each public contracting authority in charge of the tendering procedures. In addition, a conviction of EOLO’s legal representatives to imprisonment for a time frame longer than six months (as well as the application of security or precautionary measures on the same individuals) must be disclosed to the MED and may lead to the termination of our General Authorizations. “—Our ability to obtain _all licenses, permits, rights of use or other authorizations required to operate our business and/or expand our network or any other required licenses, permits or other authorizations is subject to risks and uncertainties.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The build-out of our FWA network is subject to risks and uncertainties which could delay the introduction of services 46 ----- in some areas and increase the cost of network construction. We are seeking to increase our presence in the residential ultra-broadband market in rural and suburban areas in Italy, including the southern regions, by investing significant efforts and resources to expand our footprint and the density of our FWA network. See “Business.” Such network expansion, including those in our development pipeline, require substantial capital expenditure throughout the planning and construction phases and it may take an extended period of time before the expanded parts of our FWA network become fully operational. During the planning and expansion process, we are subject to a number of construction, financing, operating, regulatory and other risks beyond our control, including, but not limited to: ‰ increases in capital and/or operating costs; ‰ changes in demand for our services; ‰ labor disputes and disputes with contractors and sub-contractors; ‰ inadequate engineering, project management, capacity or infrastructure, including as a result of failure by third parties to fulfil their obligations relating to the provision of utilities and transportation links that are necessary or desirable for the successful operation of a project; ‰ electricity and power interruptions due to electricity load-shedding and/or blackouts, and energy shortages; ‰ regulatory regimes impacting our business; ‰ changes in foreign currency exchange rates (we purchase certain BTS equipment from non-Italian suppliers with contracts denominated in U.S. dollar); ‰ adverse changes in export duties, including as a result of trade wars; ‰ failure to complete projects timely and/or according to specifications; ‰ failure to meet license obligations; ‰ adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; ‰ environmental regulations, including the need to perform feasibility studies and conduct remedial activities; ‰ political, social and economic conditions; ‰ fraud, theft and malfeasance; ‰ accidents; ‰ terrorist action; ‰ changes in law, rules, regulations, governmental priorities and regulatory regimes; and ‰ difficulties in obtaining and/or maintaining project development permission or requisite governmental licenses, permits or approvals. Although we have not yet experienced significant delays in our build out and maintenance program resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be future impacts resulting from workforce shortages. Additionally, we may experience supply chain disruption if suppliers go out of business, cannot access sufficient stock or experience delays in receiving permits or permissions as the relevant authorities focus elsewhere. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our current or future network expansion projects on schedule or within budget, if at all, and may prevent us from achieving the projected revenues, internal rates of return or capacity associated with such projects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate revenues or profits from our expansion projects that meet our planned targets and objectives, or that such revenues will be sufficient to cover the associated construction and development costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. 47 ----- In addition, our assumptions associated with maintenance and continued upgrades of our networks (including upgrading our network infrastructure from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth) may prove to be inaccurate. Our current network capacity may not be sufficient for all future services we plan to offer, or we may need to accelerate capital expenditure plans if demand would exceed our planning. If we fail to successfully maintain and upgrade our networks, our services and products may be less attractive to new customers and we may lose existing customers to our competitors, or we may become subject to additional financial strain due to unbudgeted investments. In addition, our network upgrades may fail to generate a positive return on investment, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. If our capital expenditures exceed our projections or our operating cash flow is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing for future maintenance and upgrades or scale back planned maintenance and upgrade programs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

If we are not able to successfully compete, our financial performance and business prospects may be materially adversely affected.","The telecommunications market in Italy is characterized by high levels of competition among fixed-line and mobile telecommunications and broadband service providers. TIM, Fastweb, Vodafone, Iliad and Linkem are currently our principal competitors. TIM and Fastweb have well-established positions in the Italian market, have the advantage of long-standing relationships with the Italian customers and have a large spectrum capacity in the White areas. TIM has recently publicly announced its plans to reach 1 million households with 5G FWA (mobile broadband) technology. Fastweb benefits from Open Fibers’s FTTH/FWA platform in White areas. Linkem is a pure-play FWA company operating in urban areas. Certain of our competitors also benefit from greater levels of global advertising or stronger brand recognition than we do. In addition, we offer our excess capacity to other operators (e.g., TIM and Wind) who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to migrate customers currently served through non-performing technologies in our Target Addressable Market. As such our solutions are then sold using our competitors’ brand, we could facilitate our competitors’ business increasing their ability to compete with us. The level of penetration and the highly consolidated nature of the Italian telecommunications market generally could result in continued pricing pressure and churn, and our competitiveness will depend in part on our ability to introduce new technologies, convergent services and attractive bundled products at competitive prices. If we are unable to successfully manage our subscriber turnover or otherwise lose subscribers, we may face increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs and reduced revenues, profitability or lower cash flows. If we are unable to win subscribers from our competitors and/or retain its existing subscribers, or if we fail to launch compelling and innovative products and services at competitive prices, we could lose our subscribers and the financial performance and business prospects for our business could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Our main equipment suppliers include Cambium and Intracom. Suppliers of network equipment have limited resources which may impact the rapidity of our network expansion. In addition, our customer service is partially outsourced through a dedicated call center. Customer assistance services help us build and maintain good relationships with our customers, which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. We also outsource our CPE installation and replacement to around 600 contractors and 1,500 technicians distributed across the country. In addition to our direct sales channels, we also use a variety of third parties for the sales of our B2C and B2B services through indirect sales channels. The outsourcing of services and functions exposes us to certain risks. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to our operations and could result in us incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if we were required to locate alternative service providers or insource previously outsourced services. Our ability to renew our existing contracts with suppliers of products or services, or enter into new contractual relationships, with these or other suppliers, upon the expiration of such contracts, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events, which may be beyond our control. We will also face the risk that the third party providers will fail to deliver the services that we require or that services will fail to meet required operating and quality standards. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in our supply of products and services from key sourcing partners and other providers could create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and 48 ----- prospects. For example, if our contractual arrangements with Cambium and Intracom are terminated or no longer offered on reasonable terms, we may not be able to find an alternative equipment supplier on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, we have been supporting the creation of our community of installers providing them continuous formation, assistance, supporting tools and applications and engagement activities and it could be extremely difficult for us to replace them in a timely manner. Finally, our business might be affected by any disruption, delay, defect, quality issues, capacity shortage, or other issues adversely affecting the service quality of the third party provider, such as the recent chip shortage. We also rely on our contracts with Open Fiber in order to provide ultra-broadband FTTH to certain of our customers.

AGCOM and the MED together regulate the Italian telecommunications market pursuant to a regulatory framework adopted at European level and implemented in Italy in particular through Legislative Decree No 259 of August 1, 2003 and its amendments and implementing regulatory acts. A description of certain regulations applicable to our business and the markets in which we operate is set out in “Regulation.” These regulations are, and any development of or modification to these regulations will be, material to the business, financial condition, and results of our operations. Investors should read the “Regulation” section to have a summary understanding the scope and extent of such regulations. These regulations cover, without limitation, European and domestic regulations regarding licensing, access, numbering, portability, competition, frequency allocation, license renewals and costs and arrangements pertaining to interconnection, leased lines, radio equipment, as well as consumer protection, data protection and privacy.

We may be adversely affected by certain decisions of the regulators or interpretation of laws applicable to its services and offerings. In particular, our ability to compete effectively in our existing or new markets could be adversely affected if regulators decide to expand the restrictions and obligations to which we are subject or extend such restrictions and obligations to new services and markets, or otherwise withdraw or adopt regulations.

While we seek to apply best practice policies and devote significant resources to network security and 49 ----- other security measures to protect our information technology and communications systems and data, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Despite existing security measures, certain of our wireless infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches. An unexpected increase in volume on our network and systems could cause them to malfunction, such as in periods of increased demand or unexpected circumstances that may reduce our ability to service our infrastructure, or in a health crisis similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our repair performance and installation of new projects can be impacted by the effects of increased absenteeism in the field workforce and our expert teams in technology, or even by the imposition of a lockdown that prevents or hinders the displacement and access of field maintenance teams to equipment stations. We may have our supply chain for technological product inputs impacted by any delay in the manufacturing process of vendors in their countries of origin, due to a new wave of COVID-19 that imposes a total lockdown. The performance of our information technology systems may also be impacted by certain operating conditions in the markets in which we operate, including lack of reliable power supply as well as general security conditions. An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, or damage caused by other means could potentially result in the interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers, our inability to meet expected levels of service or data transmitted over our customers’ networks being compromised. We cannot guarantee that our security and power backup measures will not be circumvented or fail, resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers’ network availability, potentially resulting in penalties for failure to meet targeted quality levels, as well as otherwise having an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and/or operational results. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. In addition, as we implement new information technology systems, we cannot guarantee that our new security measures will be sufficient. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose customers. Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. Our employees or external actors operating in any geography may commit these attacks. Any such events could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to data piracy or other data privacy and security breaches which could result in the leakage and unauthorized dissemination of information about our Subscribers, including their names, addresses, home phone numbers, passport details and individual tax numbers. In addition, the breach of security of our data and illegal sale or other unauthorized release of our subscribers’ personal information could materially adversely impact our reputation, prompt lawsuits against us by our subscribers, lead to violations of data protection laws and adverse actions by the telecommunications regulators and other authorities, lead to a loss in subscribers and hinder our ability to attract new subscribers. If severe customer data security breaches are detected, the regulatory authority can sanction us, and such sanction can include suspension of operations for some time period. Moreover, under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), beginning in May 2018, breach of our data protection obligations may be subject to administrative fines of the greater of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover. In addition, we may be exposed to cyberattacks, which could result in equipment failures or disruptions in our operations. Finally, we may face in the future consumer complaints for unsolicited marketing campaigns which also may result to significant fines and prompt lawsuits.

Our trademark registrations include, inter alia, the signs “EOLO”, “EOLO wave” and others. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may not be deterred from misuse, theft or misappropriation of them, including trade secrets and information that we regard as proprietary. For example, we developed EOLIA, a key software for design, operations, management and monitoring but we have not obtained a patent for EOLIA and no patent application has been made. We have filed 50 ----- various applications for the registration of our intellectual property in Italy and in certain other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our applications may not be granted, our existing protections may expire and we may fail to obtain such protections in the future. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming. While we are not currently involved in any intellectual property disputes, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or take unilateral steps to invalidate our intellectual property rights, which could result in a holding or official action that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part.

The loss of one or more of these key individuals could significantly impede our financial plans, product development, network expansion, marketing and other plans. Our future operating results depend, in a significant part, upon the continued contributions of our existing management and our ability to expand our senior management team by adding highly skilled new members, who may be difficult to identify and recruit. In particular, our Chairman’s and CEO’s continued involvement in the strategic oversight of the Group is key for our continued development and competitive position. In addition, competition for qualified executives in the telecommunications industry in the markets in which we operate is intense, and individuals with industry-specific experience are scarce. As a result, we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain such professionals in the face of increasing opportunities in the markets in which we operate. While we constantly seek to recruit and retain an adequate number of qualified professionals in the telecommunications industry, we may not successfully be able to do so. Moreover, integration of new management would require additional time and resources, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our strategy.

Our ability to recoup our FWA-related expenditures will depend largely upon the costs of developing such technology and the continued and increasing 51 ----- customer demand for this type of services. Although there have been signs of widespread demand for high-speed internet services in recent years, the size of the market is still unknown and may fall short of industry expectations and this technology may not prove more attractive to subscribers than other existing technologies and services. If FWA-based services do not, or are slower than anticipated to, gain sufficiently broad commercial acceptance in Italy, or if we derive a smaller percentage of our total revenues than expected, we may not be able to adequately recoup our investment or profit from such investment. Compared to the FTTH technology, FWA service often requires line-of-sight access between the subscriber and a ground station. Obstructions from hills or trees prevent it from being installed in some locations. Storms can sometimes adversely affect the quality of the service. These FWA features might limit the expansion of the FWA technology as customers could, depending on factors such as relative performance and price, choose instead the FTTH technology (if available) or mobile internet services. In addition, over the past few years we have started to migrate our customers from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth. Due to the physical characteristics of electromagnetic waves, the 28 GHz network design allows for tighter tolerances compared to networks based on other carrier bandwidths. If we do not keep adopting a control and validation process for the 28 GHz implementation, by investing in a dedicated measuring tool that ascertains the correct tilt and azimuth of the panel, the quality of our service may be affected and customers could consider other solutions. Moreover, a substantial portion of our FWA services operates in the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum, which is used by a wide range of consumer devises and is becoming increasing crowded. If such 5GHz spectrum usage continues to increase through the proliferation of consumer electronics and products competitive with ours, the resultant higher levels of noise in the bands of operation our FWA services use could decrease the effectiveness of our FWA services, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Our business could be further harmed if currently unlicensed spectrum becomes licensed in Italy. We may be unable to obtain licenses for such spectrum. Even if the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum remains unlicensed, existing and new governmental regulations may require we make changes in our FWA services. For example, we may be required limit our ability to use FWA technology in licensed or otherwise restricted spectrum. The operation of our FWA services in a manner not in compliance with Italian law could result in fines, operational disruption, or harm to our reputation. In addition, our ability to recoup our FWA-related expenditures will depend largely upon implementing a competitive pricing strategy that appeals to consumers. As a result, the costs to develop such technology, the failure to recoup its expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Accordingly, our results may be adversely impacted by negative economic, legal or political developments in Italy, or by our failure to anticipate the needs and preferences of Italian subscribers in terms of our marketing, services and investments. A downturn in the Italian economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect spending generally as well as demand and pricing for our products and services, the creditworthiness of our customers and other counterparties, the ability of other telecommunication companies to compete effectively, and the availability and cost of debt financing. In September 2019, a coalition government composed of the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was sworn in. Such coalition government was formed following the 2018 general election, in which no party won an outright majority, which resulted in a “hung” parliament and led to protracted negotiations to form a new government. These negotiations were concluded with the formation of a coalition government, composed of the anti-establishment League and Five Star Movement parties, which collapsed in August 2019. It is unclear how long the current technocratic government will remain in office and whether it will be able to adequately address impediments to the country’s growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the writedown of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. Continuation or further worsening of these economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government-mandated actions, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, led to disruption and volatility in the global and Italian capital markets and had a negative impact on global, regional and national economies and disrupted supply chains and reduced international trade and business activity. Although during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for streamed entertainment and online working and learning have increased the demand for reliable and fast connectivity significantly, churn rates in the year ended March 31, 2021 were higher than usual due to the one-off effect of the lockdown driven by unexpected network 53 ----- overload which resulted in more frequent technical issues and a lower quality of service delivered to customers. If the pandemic continues for an extended period, it may also reduce demand from our post-paid clients for more expensive plans or certain services or even lead to plan cancellations or increased delinquency.

As of June 30, 2021, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €438.3 million, including €375.0 million representing the aggregate principal amount of Notes. In addition, we will have €125.0 million of available revolving credit under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we expect to be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing Date. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, such limitations are subject to exceptions and qualifications and the incurrence of additional indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose.

Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer will be a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than, following the Acquisition Closing Date, the shares it will hold in the Target and its receivables under the Funding Loan. The Issuer will in part be, dependent upon the cash flows from the Target and any of its future operating subsidiaries and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo will in part be, dependent upon the cash flows from any of its future operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, principal repayments under the Funding Loan or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the 59 ----- Notes. See “—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the Post-Completion _Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.” The amounts of_ dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will in part depend, on the profitability and cash flows of the Target and any of its future operating subsidiaries and, following the Post-Completion Merger, the amounts of dividends and distributions available to MergerCo will in part depend, on the profitability and cash flows of any of its future subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable. More generally, the Issuer’s or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s, subsidiaries (if any) may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s (or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s) ability to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of the Target and any of its future subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer and, following the Post-Completion Merger, to MergerCo. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our future subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Target and its future subsidiaries or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s future subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their debt when due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the Funding Loan is currently expected to be approximately €146.1 million, which is significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes, and we expect the Funding Loan to yield interest broadly in line with the interest accruing under the Notes. Accordingly, prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Target and its future subsidiaries to pay dividends to it, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective. Following the Post- Completion Merger the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Target will have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes, and, accordingly, the Issuer will rely on its ability to pay dividends in order to be able to service the Notes.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility. At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility (which is six months prior to the maturity of the Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

The Revolving Credit Facility will bear a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, the Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) or (as applicable) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), in each case plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement does not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of this rate, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements, that hedges might not be available for the full amount or term of the borrowings, that break clauses might be required or that hedges will limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark rates (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, in respect of some currencies and tenors, and after certain later dates for other currencies and tenors. This proposed elimination of the LIBOR benchmark and possible future announcements in respect of any other benchmark, 62 ----- changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, including the need to adopt a replacement benchmark, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Notes). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed. If we determine that EURIBOR or LIBOR have been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or the agent (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Our estimation of the timing required to complete the PostCompletion Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involves acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Post-Completion Merger can be expected to take place.

The obligations of each Guarantor, the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee and the obligations of the grantor of security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the security interests will be limited under the Indenture to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor or provided by the grantor of security under the applicable laws of Italy, which has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws related to, among others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the relevant Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee. In particular, enforcement of any Guarantee or security interest against the relevant Guarantor or pledgor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the relevant Guarantee or pledges of security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements 65 ----- applicable to the relevant Guarantors or pledgors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Guarantee or of a pledgor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, as regards to the Target, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement: (i) the Guarantee and security interests (if any) granted by the Target will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the Funding Loan) (or other financial support in any form, not including equity contributions) advanced from time to time to the Target (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests (if any) granted by the Target; provided that the Target shall be fully entitled to exercise any rights of set-off, recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) or other similar rights it may have by reason of any payment made by it under its Guarantee in respect of any obligations owed by the Issuer, against the payment obligations of the Target under any relevant intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support received by the Target, provided that the liability of the Target under its Guarantee shall not exceed the aggregate amount of any such intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support following the exercise of any such set-off rights; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Target, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of the Target under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively; and (v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest (if any) by the Target does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the Target and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of 66 ----- the share capital of the Target. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests (if any) granted by the Target be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests (if any) could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the Target will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the Guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/ or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant notes guarantee and security. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations _and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws apply to the Guarantee. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of that Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: ‰ the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Guarantee was given; ‰ the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became 67 ----- undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; ‰ the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or ‰ the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent such limitations on the Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or notes guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims.

The principal amount of the Funding Loan is currently expected to be €146.1 million, which is significantly less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. Repayments prior to the Acquisition Closing Date of amounts due in respect of the Refinanced Target Indebtedness would result in a reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan entered into on the Acquisition Closing Date. We cannot assure you that these amounts will not be reduced by additional payments prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, which would cause a corresponding reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan. The intercompany receivables arising under the Funding Loan will constitute part of the PostCompletion Collateral. Prior to completion of the Post-Completion Merger, repayments of the Funding Loan prior to the maturity date of the Notes would result in a reduction in the liability owed by the Target to the Issuer and any reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan would reduce the value of such receivable and the Post-Completion Collateral and, if the Target guarantees after the Cut-Off Date, the value of the Guarantee by the Target. Any reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan could also adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes if the Issuer is otherwise unable to cause its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make loans or other distributions to it. The Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer or the Target to amend the Funding Loan documentation. See also “—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure— _The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post- Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the Target to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_ The security interests in the Funding Loan will cease to exist automatically upon completion of the PostCompletion Merger.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position or interpretation by the relevant Italian tax authority regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the tax authorities in Italy may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax, including withholding tax, treatment or characterization of our past, current and future indebtedness, including the Notes, and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or through reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of our various financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax, including withholding tax, treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could result in higher taxes to be paid and the application of significant penalties and interest that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and restated, “Article 96”) sets forth limitations to interest deductibility for corporate income tax purposes. Article 96 69 ----- allows for the full deductibility of interest expenses incurred by a company in a given tax year only up to the amount of the interest income of the same tax year plus interest income carried forward from previous tax years. Any excess of interest income of a given tax year can be carried forward without limitation. Interest expenses in excess of interest income (of the relevant tax year and of the previous ones) are deductible for corporate income tax purposes up to a threshold that is 30% of the EBITDA of an Italian tax resident company (i.e., risultato _operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica, “ROL”) as recorded in such company’s profit and loss account and_ adjusted according to domestic corporate income tax rules (the “Excess”). The unused ROL is carried forward, increasing the amount of yearly ROL, for the subsequent five tax years. The Excess can be carried forward to the subsequent tax years and deducted accordingly, provided, and to the extent, that, in such tax years, the amount of yearly interest expenses that exceed interest income is lower than 30% of the available ROL (including the ROL carried forward from previous tax years). In the case of a tax group, interest expenses not deducted by a participant in the tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax group level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other participants in the tax group. Article 96 provides special rules for certain entities active in the insurance and finance sector. Italian Legislative Decree no. 142 of November 29, 2018, enacting the EU anti-tax avoidance package was published in the Italian official gazette on December 28, 2018. The Italian ATAD Decree transposes EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD 1)—as amended by EU Directive 2017/952 (ATAD 2)—into the Italian legal system, providing rules against the erosion of taxable bases in the internal market and the shifting of profits out of the Italian market. Such rules are aimed at tackling “double deduction” or “deduction without inclusion” (deduction of a negative income component in one country without any taxation in the other country) due to a different characterization of financial instruments, payments, entities, and permanent establishments in various countries. The rules apply to mismatches occurring between taxpayers considered to be associated enterprises or arising in the context of a structured arrangement between two non-associated taxpayers. The Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E (“Circular Letter”) clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in leveraged buy-out transactions are generally deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 and excluding cases of reinvestment (also partial) by the seller(s). In case an acquisition is—or is considered as—entered into by one or more entities that are related parties to the seller(s), the deduction of interest expenses is likely to be challenged by the tax authorities based on anti-abuse provisions, unless non marginal business reasons exist for the debt-financed acquisition. Also, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than those of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law). Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle and/or to make an acquisition under the anti-abuse provisions, we may be unable to deduct our interest expenses and/or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. If the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to carry out the Refinancing under the “business purpose” principle or the “abuse of law” provisions, we or another entity of the Group may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses or be subject to significant penalties and interest for late payment of taxes or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, or (iii) the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense, or (iv) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax authorities of Italian tax law, may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 70 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The Commission’s Proposal is still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and Financial Affairs Council.

In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer in the event of a default.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional notes guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the agreed security principles. The agreed security principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or notes guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of such agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Pursuant to the agreed security principles, Collateral will be limited to security over the shares of the Issuer, any future Guarantors and any member of the Group which is incorporated in Italy 72 ----- which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and subject to certain adjustments) representing more than 5% of the EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of the Group (“Material Company”), but without prejudice to the granting of the Completion Collateral. Accordingly, such agreed security principles may affect the value of the security or notes guarantees provided by the Issuer and any Guarantors. In particular, even though the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same security interests and Guarantors’ package, this may not be the case and circumstances may arise in the future in which lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or notes guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the agreed security principles and, ultimately, applicable financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances, holders of the Notes would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

There can be no assurance that the listing of the Notes on the Exchange will be granted in a timely manner or at all or that, once granted, will be maintained. Additionally, the Issuer makes no representation that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement under Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax. The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing requirement of the aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their issuance to benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax. Hence, according to a stringent interpretation of this circular, the Notes may not be eligible to benefit from such provisions if the listing of the Notes is not effective as of the Issue Date. In the event that the Notes are not listed or that such listing requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax (ritenuta a titolo di imposta o acconto), currently at a rate of 26% and, subject to certain exceptions under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes such that holders receive a net amount that is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. We cannot assure you that the Italian tax authorities will not interpret the applicable legislation as requiring that the listing be effective at closing (upon issuance of the Notes) and we cannot assure you that the listing can be achieved by the Issue Date. However, we intend to achieve the required listing of the Notes on the Issue Date by obtaining a listing on the Exchange.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the extent of the Collateral is limited, including by virtue of the fact that no assets located in, and no shares of any subsidiary incorporated in, any jurisdiction other than Italy will constitute part of the Collateral, and any subsidiary incorporated in any jurisdiction other than Italy shall not provide any guarantee or security in favor of the Notes. In accordance with the agreed security principles, notes guarantees and/or security shall only be granted by certain entities. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer, the Target and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. 73 ----- The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to (or different from) those that has been required to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In particular by operation of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, security interests in the Collateral may be released if a lien is granted on the Collateral in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien is a Permitted Lien (as defined under “Description of the _Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”).

The granting of the Guarantee and any security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.","The granting of the Guarantee and any security interests to secure the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening, claw back or voidance periods for such Guarantee and security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The granting of shared security interests (including security interests in the Collateral), including in connection with any release and retake of such security interest, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening or claw back periods in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The applicable hardening, claw back or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts 74 ----- could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph. Similar considerations also apply following the Acquisition Closing Date, in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Indenture does not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may be limited. In addition, even if we received the approval by the presidency of the Italian Council of Ministries, Italian Golden Power Legislation (including the clearances regime) will continue to be applicable to the Target and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo, in case the relevant entity is involved in any transaction, act or resolution falling within the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation, including, among others, any transfers of the Target’s and MergerCo’s shares, including upon enforcement of the Target’s share pledge (if any) and Issuer’s share pledge (and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s share pledge), the granting and/or enforcement of security over certain assets of the Target and/or any other transactions triggering a change of control covered by such legislation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” 75 ----- In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any future Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_ of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Notes as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Guarantee of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%. Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Under certain circumstances, in the event that the Post- Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Target guarantees the Notes. On the Issue Date, our obligations under the Notes, subject to certain agreed security principles, will be secured by security interests 77 ----- over the Escrowed Property, on a first priority basis. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Completion Collateral. Within 20 Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Completion Collateral. The Issuer and the Target are incorporated under the laws of Italy. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations _and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security interests or the Guarantee in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantee and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: ‰ avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests provided by such security provider; ‰ direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and ‰ take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or security interests are found to be a preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantor and the security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Guarantee and _the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” and “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ 78 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantee were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors or security provider: ‰ issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; ‰ issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantee or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; ‰ received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the creation of the Guarantee or security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; ‰ the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or ‰ the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any security interest if: ‰ its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; ‰ it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or ‰ the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that the Issuer and the Target are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantee were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and 79 ----- payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” for further information._ Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU. If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the,13.5.5,The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the Post-Completion Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.,"Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be applicable in respect of the Funding Loan borrowed by the Target. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the Target’s obligations under the Funding Loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should the Target’s obligations under the Funding Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, prior to the Post-Completion Merger the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Funding Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_ Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans (including the Funding Loan) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including, under certain circumstances in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantee to be provided by the Target) may be impaired or restricted. 80 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.

Unless otherwise noted, the adjustments column does not give effect to movements in cash and cash equivalents or amounts borrowed or repaid after June 30, 2021. We believe that presenting the cash and cash equivalents and capitalization of the Issuer in this manner is the most meaningful way to present the financial position of the Issuer after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021, given the Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating activities of its own and without any business operations, material assets or liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions.

624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are the largest provider of broadband (“BB”) and ultra-broadband (“UBB”) fixed-wireless access (“FWA”) services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the second largest based on number of subscribers with a market share of 34.7% for year ended March 31, 2021. Our mission is to close the digital and speed divide by offering high-speed broadband connectivity services in underserved rural (i.e., White areas) and suburban areas (i.e., Grey II areas) in Italy where alternative connection technologies are either unavailable or significantly delayed (i.e., FTTH) or have lower speed and quality performance (i.e., ADSL or FTTC). As a result, we mainly focus on identified rural and suburban areas comprising approximately 11.5 million households in Italy where the penetration of broadband connection services is lower than in the rest of Italy and where we offer the highest available speed (our “Target Addressable Market” or “TAM”). Our unique FWA infrastructure platform enables us to offer in our Target Addressable Market, in a cost-effective manner, speeds of up to 100 Mbps (download speed) and we are working to increase connection speeds to 300 Mbps in the near future to further distinguish our service offer. With selected business customers, we already offer speeds of up 1 Gbps (download speed) through point-to-point (“PTP”) wireless link connections.

624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.16,Italian Fixed Broadband Infrastructure,18.16.1,,"In the Italian market, fixed broadband services rely primarily on copper, fiber and wireless networks. In Italy, coaxial cable network infrastructure has not been developed. _Copper_ Copper (xDSL) has the largest coverage in the Italian market, with 99.6% of Italian households covered, in line with the EU-5 average coverage of 99.0% (2019). The Italian telecommunications incumbent, Telecom Italia SpA (“TIM”), owns the majority of the nationwide copper (xDSL) network and offers broadband access to 16.6 million households, while having a direct retail market share of around 42.2%, or 7.8 million customers. TIM also offers another approximately 7.8 million wholesale accesses. _Fiber_ The fiber network in Italy is still at an early stage with a coverage of only 30.4% of Italian households as compared to a European average of 41%. It is expected that Italy will reach a fiber coverage level similar to other European countries by 2030 or so. In Italy, the main operators of the fiber network include Open Fiber, FiberCop and Fastweb. Open Fiber was formed in December 2015 by Enel S.p.A. and CDP (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, an Italian government investment fund) and secured financing of €7 billion with a target to connect 19 million Italian households with FTTH accesses by the end of 2020. As of the end of September 2020, Open Fiber passed 11.6 million homes with FTTH. Open Fiber is a pure wholesaler to telecommunications services providers such as Vodafone, Wind 3 and Tiscali. Open Fiber has been awarded the three tenders granted by Infratel for the creation of a UBB infrastructure for an overall White area coverage plan of approximately 8.4 million of property units (the coverage in the original plan was 9.5 million), of which 6.2 million of property units (the coverage in the original plan was 7.9 million) will be covered by FTTH and 2.2 million will be covered by FWA (the coverage in the original plan was 1.6 million). Since the awards of the three Infratel tenders, Open Fiber increased the FWA proportion to 26%. In addition, it is reported that Open Fiber has completed coverage of only 22.6% of the targeted FTTH municipalities and only 3.6% for FWA due to higher costs and longer deployment times than initially expected; the original announced plan was to achieve 100% coverage by December 2020. FiberCop was formed by TIM in early 2021 and is owned by TIM (58%), KKR (37.5%) and Fastweb (4.5%). FiberCop operates TIM’s secondary network (from the street cabinet to customers’ homes) and the fiber network developed by FlashFiber, the joint venture between TIM (80%) and Fastweb (20%). FiberCop’s announced aim is to become the largest infrastructure wholesaler in Italy, connecting 56% or 14 million of all technical units (residential or business sites which have had a fixed line connection in the last 10 years, corresponding to approximately 5 million occupied premises based on ISTAT) as of the end of 2025.

DSL technology leverages the fact that copper wires used in telephone networks have a much higher bandwidth (7 MHz) than that required for normal voice conversation (3.4 KHz). See—“Italian Fixed Broadband Infrastructure—Copper.” DSL utilizes the extra bandwidth to provide broadband internet connections. The most commonly used variant of DSL is ADSL, which was designed on the basis that internet users normally receive or download significantly more information than they send or upload. ADSL connections normally have three to four times more bandwidth for downloading, providing download speeds of up to 30 Mbps with a latency of 10ms on average. However, as copper is a distance-sensitive medium, access speeds for DSL technology decrease substantially as the distance from DSL hubs increases. Historically, ADSL was the predominant FBB distribution platform in Italy and accounted for 85.9% of FBB connections in 2015. However, the market share of ADSL has been consistently eroded by upgraded FTTC connections and, more recently, by better performing technologies, such as FTTH and FWA. This has resulted in a decline in ADSL market share to 27.3% as of March 2021. _FTTC (Fiber-to-the-Cabinet)_ FTTC is a hybrid technology as it links the street cabinets with regional and national POPs as well as with data centers with fiber optic connections, while the so called “last mile” between the cabinet and the households/ premises is linked through telephone network copper wires. FTTC allows internet speeds up to 100 Mbps. 125 ----- However, the performance of FTTC is highly dependent on the length of the copper wire (i.e., the distance between the house and the local hub/cabinet), with speeds decreasing to approximately 30Mbps for households located more than one kilometer from the nearest cabinet. The average latency (the time it takes to send data and receive a response) for FTTC is 5 milliseconds (ms) (as compared to 0 – 1 ms for FTTH and 1 ms for FWA). TIM controls the majority of ADSL and FTTC coverage in Italy, with a small portion of such coverage held by Vodafone and Fastweb. Over the last few years, TIM focused its fixed network capital expenditures mainly on upgrading households from ADSL to FTTC, which led to a significant growth of FTTC’s market share from 7.4% in 2015 to 52.4% as of March 2021 of Italian FBB connections. However, FTTC is expected to be gradually replaced by better performing new technologies such as FTTH and FWA. The ADSL and FTTC legacy technologies are the dominant technologies in EOLO’s Target Addressable Market, with market shares in 2020 of 39.3% and 50.0%, respectively, in Grey II areas, and 62.5% and 25.0%, respectively, in White II areas. In White I areas, FTTC is not deployed and ADSL had a 78.3% market share in 2020. _FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home)_ In Italy, FTTH is currently viewed as the leading broadband technology in terms of speed, latency and reliability. A FTTH connected house has a fiber optic cable between the cabinet and the regional and national POPs and data centers, and a fiber optic connection between the cabinet and the household/premise. FTTH connections provide speeds of up to 1Gbps (and faster), while the performance is not affected by the distance between the households and the cabinet. FTTH’s latency is approximately 0-1ms on average. Due to its high deployment costs, rolling out FTTH technology is generally economically viable only in densely populated areas where it is possible to achieve economies of scale and is suboptimal in rural or even suburban areas. However, given political support (at both the EU and Italian government levels) for the FTTH rollout in Italy and the availability of public subsidies, FTTH is announced to be rolled out even in rural areas. However, it may be the case that the FTTH rollout in rural areas will be limited due to the Italian government’s limited financial resources (despite the RRP) and Open Fiber’s focus on more economically viable areas. As a result, FTTH, is not expected to be rolled out in Grey II and White II areas and is expected to be rolled out in White I areas from 2021. See—“Italian Fixed _Broadband Infrastructure—Fiber.”_ FTTH connections currently play a very limited role in the Italian FBB market. Supported by the gradual roll out of fiber infrastructure, FTTH connections have grown at a 45% CAGR between 2015 and March 2021 reaching a total of 2.11 million connections (11.5%) in March 2021. In EOLO’s Target Addressable Market, as of March 2021, FTTH accounts for only 2% of total FBB connections. Given its high connectivity performance, FTTH is expected to gradually replace ADSL and FTTC connections and gain a leading market share in Italy, except in rural and suburban areas (including EOLO’s Core Target Addressable Market (Grey II and White II areas)). _FWA (Fixed Wireless Access)_ FWA uses a hybrid system of wired fiber and wireless networks to offer fixed broadband and ultra-broadband services. FWA networks offer internet access through a network of antennas and receivers. Each antenna is linked through optical fiber to regional and national POPs as well as with data centers. Connection to households and single premises is carried out through radiofrequencies, offering speeds in the 30-100 Mbps range (up to 1 Gbps for business clients with PTP access). FWA’s latency is 1 ms on average. FWA providers aim to offer broadband services with higher download and upload speeds at similar or lower prices than their competing ADSL/FTTC network providers. FWA represents the best solution to deliver highspeed connections in rural and suburban areas, as it benefits from lower installation costs and superior marketability due to lower installation times. We estimate that in rural areas the deployment capital expenditure required per active customer amounts to €1,300 for FTTH, compared to €608 for FWA. This lower capital expenditure results in a significantly shorter payback period for FWA as compared to FTTH, FTTH’s costs are also increased by its higher KO rates as compared to FWA connections in rural areas. FWA also benefits from a superior marketability (as compared to FTTH) due to shorter installation times in rural areas. In those White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is generally a significant time gap between the completion of the FTTH network and availability for use by broadband operators due to the lack of last meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates a time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to 126 ----- connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be exploited by FWA operators.

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router). Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans in White I areas are behind schedule, thereby creating an opportunity for FWA operators to install their networks first. Based on current regulations, Open Fiber will not be required to deploy its FWA network in those areas already covered with FWA UBB technologies by at least one other operator. Based on these considerations, FWA can be seen as the most viable UBB alternative in EOLO’s Target Addressable Market. FWA connections have doubled in the last five years, from 0.7 million in 2015 to 1.6 million (8.7% of total FBB active lines) in March 2021, reaching a share of our Target Addressable Market of 7.1% in Grey II areas, 21.7% in White I areas and 12.5% in White II areas in 2020.

Mobile broadband services are offered by mobile network operators such as TIM, Vodafone and Wind 3 and do not directly compete with fixed broadband technologies, including FWA, as they have different characteristics. In general, mobile broadband technologies, including 5G, have a different network design tailored to offer connections to mobile users with a constantly changing location and therefore offer a low data allowance, while 127 ----- FWA is designed to cope with high traffic volume per user and provide a connection between a household and a BTS. For the time being (using 4G technology), mobile broadband data transmission speeds in rural and suburban areas are relatively low compared to average FWA speeds and depend heavily on the proximity to the next available mobile tower. To offer comparable FWA speeds in rural and suburban areas (using 5G technology), a higher network densification (higher antenna density) and high investments by mobile network operators (MNOs) would be required. Moreover, we believe that offering our excess capacity to other operators will discourage competitors from deploying their own FWA network. Some MNOs (such as TIM) have introduced “FWA-like” offers which are based on mobile infrastructure. While these “FWA-like” services will be used in selected situations, they are considered sub-optimal in comparison to FWA since they are unable to match the uncapped data allowance offered by FWA and present technical difficulties in their implementation. For example, MNOs use the same mobile BTS for fixed and mobile customers but mobile BTS point down to street level where the mobile user is located, while the FWA BTS point up in order to deliver the signal with direct line of sight above the interference noise (“above the clutter”) to the rooftop-mounted CPEs. As a consequence, since mobile BTS are not in clear line-of-sight above the interference noise, which is much stronger at street level, mobile BTS generally end up having a relatively poorer quality of service. Furthermore, as of today, MNOs do not use rooftop-based CPEs but rather indoor CPEs or window/ balcony mounted CPEs, which generally leads to higher signal losses (up to 50% of signal for FMBB as compared to 30% for FWA). If MNOs aim at delivering speeds on par with FWA operators using these “FWA-like” offers, MNOs will need to offer rooftop-based CPEs, which will require significant upfront capital expenditure. A number of Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellite projects have been launched recently, which offer improved quality of service as compared to broadband technology offerings utilizing Geostationary (“GEO”) and Medium Earth Orbit Satellites (“MEO”). However, these enhanced LEO satellite broadband technologies offer lower quality services than FWA in terms of average speed, latency and price. Indeed, the top average speed of satellite connections are of up to 80 Mbps with latency of 40 ms on average, much lower than the 300 Mbps speed with 1 ms latency offered by FWA. In addition, LEO satellites have significantly higher capital expenditure requirements than FWA, with a satellite unit cost of €500,000, and the quality of signal is more adversely affected by weather conditions as compared to FWA technology. Furthermore, rooftop CPEs must be able to track satellites as they move, switching seamlessly from one to the next as they disappear below the horizon, which is not always possible. As a result, satellite broadband is mainly offered in very remote areas where alternative data transmission technologies are not available. Satellite broadband does not represent a meaningful competitive challenge to FWA.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Under Italian law, a Benefit Company is an entity that aims at the distribution of profits, but, at the same time, pursues one or more common benefit goals in favor of other stakeholders in the business, including people, communities, territories and the environment, cultural heritage, social activities, entities and associations, by working in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner. As a Benefit Company, we pursue some specific goals of common benefit and positive impact on society and the environment, including: ‰ The promotion of wide access to online and digital services as a fundamental tool of social inclusion, the promotion of the right to universal internet connection and the education to a correct and constructive use of such services by any citizen; ‰ The support of economic system prosperity and social welfare in various territories, with particular attention to geographically disadvantaged areas, more difficult to reach and at risk of depopulation, through connectivity and access to online services and digital services; ‰ The research and continuous development of synergies with institutions and other territorial entities of various levels to bridge the digital divide in Italy, contributing with skills and solutions, with particular attention to emergency situations. 153 ----- The commitment to sustainability is an integral part to our corporate culture and lies at the core of our relationship with our employees, customers, suppliers and the broader society in which we operate. We strive to ensure a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees offering them certain benefits (e.g., company restaurant, electric car charging stations, indoor and outdoor parking, supplementary health policies, company cars etc.) and wellbeing initiatives (free internet connection, tax advisory, water and fresh fruit, company shuttle from/to station, changing rooms with showers for sports activities) in addition to our working from home policy (two days per week of remote working). Overall, we place great importance on our corporate social responsibility and our public image and endeavor to apply the highest ethical and legal standards when shaping our strategic goals and in our daily business activities. We strive to incorporate ethical and social responsibility principles in our internal guidelines and procedures. In addition, we give our employees extensive opportunities to develop their skills and talents (e.g., we use competency evaluation programs and potential assessment system which allow to identify the expectations, potential, strengths and areas for improvement of our employees) and offer various training courses (e.g., traditional classroom training, e-learning sessions, experiential training and team building).",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

It is alleged that EOLO used certain frequency bands without having received the relevant authorization by the competent authority. The frequency range (3.8-4.2 GHz) was used after having filed a “statement for experimentation” with the MED. EOLO used the frequency range until October 7, 2016 when the MED issued the order to stop. More specifically the MED ordered to cease the use of the frequencies and payment of a fine for approximately €200 thousand. The charges against our former and current managers are (i) aggravated theft of unauthorized radio-frequencies; (ii) aggravated fraud against the Italian State concerning the unlawful appropriation of radio-frequencies without the relevant authorization; and (iii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this third charge was dismissed by the court in November 2019). In addition, EOLO has also been investigated for administrative liability according to the Italian Legislative Decree No. 231 with reference to: (i) the criminal offence of aggravated fraud against the Italian State; and (ii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this allegation was dismissed by the court in November 2019). The public prosecutor alleged that EOLO’s procedures were inadequate to detect and prevent the managers’ alleged behavior and would have generated for EOLO an undue profit of approximately €3.5 million between 2016 and 2017, a sum which we demonstrated to the court we would be able to pay should a judgment be rendered against us. On January 25, 2021, the public prosecutor issued a motion to dismiss the remaining two allegations of aggravated theft and aggravated fraud against the former and current managers. On February 15, 2021, Linkem S.p.A. (an industrial competitor) filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and the new hearing is expected to be held in November 2021. If the court rules again our former and current managers or EOLO, certain sanctions might be imposed (including administrative fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of the profits related to the alleged criminal conduct and certain ban measures, including prohibition of contracting with the Italian government, exclusion from public funding and contributions and prohibition from advertising goods and services). However, we have already implemented certain self-cleaning measures (e.g., we have strengthened our system, including applicable controls and procedures under Decree No. 231) and our legal counsel has advised us that the risk that the court will not authorize the dismissal is remote. As a result, we do not consider that these criminal proceedings have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We are subject to Italian _legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.”_ 156 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,European regulatory framework,58.1.1,,"Italian telecommunications operators are subject to the EU regulatory framework which includes directives, regulations, recommendations and opinions on telecommunication. As a member of the European Union, Italy is required to adopt directives issued by the EU, which, in certain cases, may have direct effect (i.e. when their provisions are unconditional and sufficiently clear and precise and when they have not been transposed in the Italian legal framework by the deadline), whereas regulations adopted at the EU level always have general application and are binding and directly applicable to all EU member states. On December 20, 2018, Directive 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communication Code (the EECC) entered into force. The EECC establishes common European rules and objectives aimed at regulating the telecommunications industry and defining how providers of networks and/or telecommunication services shall be regulated by national authorities. The EECC’s provisions include measures to stimulate investment, new spectrum rules for wireless connectivity and 5G, as well as changes to governance, the universal service regime, end-user protection rules, and numbering and emergency communication rules. Some of the main goals of the EECC include to increase competition and predictability for investments, facilitate the participation of smaller players and first movers in investment projects and to improve coordination and use of radio-frequencies across the EU (to be achieved by long durations of licenses, coordinated timing of assignments and stricter requirements on effective and efficient spectrum use). Finally, in the interests of consumer protection, the EECC focuses on the gaps where sector-specific needs are not addressed by general consumer protection provisions. The EECC also provides general principles regarding the individual rights of use of radio spectrum, such as, among others, that: (i) member states shall grant such rights, upon request, under a general authorization and shall also specify whether those rights can be transferred or leased by the holder of such rights, and under which conditions; (ii) the individual rights of use for radio spectrum shall be granted through open, objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate procedures; and (iii) the competent national authority shall promptly grant and make public its decisions on the granting of individual rights of use for radio spectrum. In addition, member states shall make available the general criteria for an extension of the duration of rights of use of radio spectrum in a transparent manner, to all interested parties in advance of granting rights of use, and such general criteria shall relate to: (a) the need to ensure the effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum concerned, including by pursuing wireless broadband coverage of their national territory and population at high quality and speed and by facilitating the rapid development in the European Union of new wireless communications technologies and applications, or the need to fulfil goals related to ensuring safety of life, public order, public security or defense; and (b) the need to ensure undistorted competition. The Directive reviews and combines in one document the “Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”, “Authorization” and “Universal Service and Users’ Rights” Directives (the revision of the Privacy and Data Protection Directive, the so-called e-privacy Directive, is ongoing under separate proceedings). On the same date, Regulation 2018/1971 also entered into force replacing the former BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) Regulation (EC) 1211/2009. Law No. 53/2021 of April 22, 2021, published in the Italian Official Journal (Gazzetta Ufficiale) on April 23, 2021 and enforced since May 8, 2021, has set forth the criteria and principles that must be taken into account by the Italian Government for the implementation of Directive (EU) No. 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 into Italian law. The EECC includes measures to promote wholesale-only models of investments and stimulate investments in very high capacity networks (VHCN), new rules on spectrum (such as minimum license duration) to improve certainty on investment return, changes to the regulation of services, introducing a more level playing field between telecommunications operators and new over-the-top-players (OTT players), and the introduction, in the 157 ----- scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO), of the affordability for consumers (with low income or special social needs) of adequate broadband internet access service and voice communications services at least at a fixed location.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The procedure to obtain the general authorization includes the following steps: (i) the operator sends a notice to start its telecommunications services and can start offering such services from the moment of the filing; (ii) the MED screens the notice and checks the operator’s requirements, and (iii) in case of a positive result, within 60 days the operator is granted with a general authorization. General authorizations generally do not last more than 20 years and they are extendable for an additional 15 years. When the rights of use of radio spectrum frequencies are not limited by the Italians authorities for public interest reasons, the general authorization provides for the relevant conditions of use of the frequencies. Conversely, when the rights of use 158 ----- are limited for public interest reasons, operators are required to obtain a specific license issued by the MED, in addition to the general authorization. The AGCOM has set out a detailed open, transparent and non-discriminatory public tender procedure to obtain such specific licenses based on an auction system. Under the IECC, in order to be granted the general authorization to provide electronic communications services, operators must file a declaration attesting, among other things, that none of their legal representatives have been condemned to imprisonment for a time frame longer than six months, nor have they been subject to security or precautionary measures under applicable laws. Once granted a general authorization, operators must continue to satisfy such requirements for the duration of the general authorization and shall promptly inform the MED if they fail to do so.

To evaluate whether resources may be considered insufficient, the AGCOM has to take into consideration several principles, such as: optimize customers benefits; foster competition development and investments sustainability; promote the effective and efficient use of frequencies; allow all stakeholders the opportunity to submit their views. Under the EECC, the procedure to assign individual rights of use of frequencies shall be based on objective, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria. According to the EECC, each national regulatory authority shall consider and evaluate an extension request of individual rights of use for radio spectrum in a timely manner (i.e., before the expiration of those rights, except for rights of use to which the renewal has been explicitly excluded). When considering possible renewal of individual rights of use for harmonized radio spectrum for which the number of rights of use is limited, competent authorities shall conduct an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure, and shall, inter alia: (a) give all interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation; and (b) clearly state the reasons for such possible renewal. In addition, the EECC also provides that the national regulatory authority shall also take into account any evidence arising from the consultation of market demand. In any case, the competent authority may review and change the fees as well as of certain terms and conditions granted/ provided in the previous license. 159 ----- In Italy, the procedure for the extension of the right of use involves both the MED and the AGCOM. As the first step, an operator shall apply to the MED for the renewal (the application shall also include technical and financial plans in order to justify the request of extension). Following that, the competent office of the MED requires a positive opinion by the AGCOM to proceed with the extension of the right of use. Before the issuance of such opinion, the AGCOM also takes in consideration the results of a stakeholder consultation so as to give all interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation. In the past, in evaluating the renewal of individual rights, the AGCOM considered (i) the consistency and adequacy of the technical and financial plan on which the application was based; and (ii) the fact that other operators holding the same licenses were already granted the extension. Based on the outcome of the public consultation and on the assessment of mentioned factors, the AGCOM provides to the MED its opinion, and then the MED issues its decision. The IECC does not specify the duration of the procedure to obtain the renewal of the rights of use. In case of a denial of the extension, the MED can commence a new tender procedure to newly award the rights to use the frequencies. The MED’s authorization is required for the transfer of individual rights (in case of merger, acquisitions, and other transactions including the Acquisition). Such authorization process also involves the competent offices of the AGCOM and the AGCM which shall provide their opinions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion of the Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.” The aim of such_ procedure is to ensure that the transfer of individual rights does not cause unfair competition and that such transfer complies with the principles of the IECC (for example, promotion of competition, consumer protection, in each geographical area, an operator is allowed to have individual rights up to 40% of the individual rights for the Wireless Local Loop frequencies). In any case, the AGCOM and the AGCM may impose specific requirements with respect to a proposed transfer requiring the sale or lease, such as selling or leasing individual rights of use. We currently hold (i) the rights of use for the 24.5-26.5 GHz (“26 GHz”) frequencies and (27.5-29.5 GHz) (“28 GHz”) frequencies for all Italian Regions and the Autonomous Province of Trento and Bolzano (awarded in 2014, 2016 and 2018 and which expire on December 31, 2022); and (ii) the rights of use for the frequency concerning the 3.4-3.6 GHz (“3.5 GHz”) in relation to the FWA system for the Region Valle d’Aosta (awarded in 2008 and which expires on May 21, 2023). Our licenses for the 26 and 28 GHz spectrum were awarded as a result of tender procedures carried out by the MED in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Such licenses provide us with the right of use related to 26 GHz and 28 GHz bands in all the Italian regions (included the provinces of Trento and Bolzano). These licenses will expire on December 31, 2022. We submitted to the MED and the AGCOM the following extension requests: (i) in relation to the 28 GHz individual rights to be extended at least until 2029; and (ii) in relation to the 26 GHz individual rights to be extended at least until 2029. We currently expect that the extension procedure will be finalized by end of 2021 for the 28 GHz spectrum and approximately at the beginning of 2022 for 26 GHz spectrum. With respect to the 3.5 GHz spectrum, the relevant license was awarded by the MED in 2013, which also provides the right to use the 3.5 GHz spectrum in the Valle d’Aosta region. The latter will expire on May 21, 2023. The additional licenses for the 11-13-18-80 GHz spectrum will expire in 2034.

In addition, certain other aspects of the applicable legal framework (including the regulation of the Register of Communications Operators (“RCO”) are regulated by various AGCOM resolutions adopted by such authority in its role as regulator in the sector, pursuant to Law no. 481/1995, establishing AGCOM’s powers, including, among others, the power to issue guidelines concerning general quality service levels. Under the IECC, the AGCOM and the MED together are entrusted to regulate the main aspects of the telecommunications markets in Italy, comprising the mobile, fixed-line and Internet markets. Their regulatory powers mainly include licensing, authorizations, access interconnection, frequency allocation, numbering, universal service obligations, tariff regulation and the rebalancing and arbitration of disputes between operators. The AGCOM is financed by telecommunications operators through a fee based on operators’ financial results. The public numbering schemes are decided by the AGCOM while the MED is responsible for numbering management and assignation. In addition, the Italian Competition Authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, the “AGCM”) enforces competition law rules which, among others, prohibit anticompetitive agreements among competitors (i.e. cartels), and the abuse of dominant positions. The AGCM also supervises: (i) possible acquisitions or mergers which may generate or strengthen dominant positions detrimental to general competition and (ii) consumer protection issues and misleading advertising proceedings. The AGCM also has several other functions and goals, including protecting consumers from misleading advertising or comparative advertising which discredits competitors’ products or causes confusion, as well as protecting consumers against unfair commercial practices. According to the IECC, the individual rights of use of radio spectrum are granted by means of open and transparent procedures set forth by the AGCOM, whereas the related fees are set up by the MED. In compliance with the general European principles set out by the EECC, member states may decide that the number of individual rights has to be limited in order to pursue a national public interest, such as promoting coverage, ensuring the quality of service or promoting the efficient use of the radio spectrum, or the innovation and business development. Therefore, the Italian authorities have imposed certain limitation of the individual rights of use of radio frequencies aimed at promoting efficient use of the radio spectrum. In particular, the IECC states that in case of insufficient resources (i.e. when it is not possible to share radio frequencies and when sharing frequencies may cause risk of interference and/or may impair the quality of service) there is a limited number of available individual rights of use, thus operators shall apply for specific licenses to be granted with the available rights of use. In all other cases (i.e., when there are sufficient resources and the efficiency of the service is not at risk), operators who have been granted with a general authorization can use the radio spectrum frequencies without requesting any additional specific licenses.

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Target represented 100%, 100% and 100% of the consolidated revenues, Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated assets of the Target (as the Target had no subsidiaries). In addition, if required by the covenant as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other Indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent provided in future, any Guarantee will be a joint and several obligation of each Guarantor. For the purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” “Guarantor” means any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture on or after the Acquisition Closing Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto). The Agreed Security Principles apply to, and restrict, the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. Additionally, the Guarantee will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee _and the Security Interests” and “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” The Guarantee_ will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will apply to, and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. Each future Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws and be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations 198 ----- subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, thin capitalization and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will not have any obligation to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Target, the Target will pay the holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the Issuer. The Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) and minority stockholders (if any) of the Target. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target). In the event that the PostCompletion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and subject to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target. After the Post-Completion Merger, none of MergerCo’s subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy of such payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding. If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders 213 ----- on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal, (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or a purchase of Notes, (3) interest, or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by 214 ----- virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement that permits the Revolving Credit Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. 215 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action.

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to 312 ----- transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

For these purposes, bonds and securities similar to bonds are securities that (i) incorporate an unconditional obligation for the Issuer to pay at maturity (or at any earlier redemption/repayment of the security) an amount not lower than their nominal value or principal amount; (ii) do not provide to the holders any right of direct or indirect participation in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with which the Notes have been issued; and (iii) do not provide for a remuneration which is entirely linked to profits of the Issuer, or other companies belonging to the same group or to the business in respect of which the Notes have been issued. 314 ----- _Italian-resident Noteholders_ Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity Where an Italian-resident beneficial owner of the Notes ( “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is: - an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected; - a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) (other than società in nome collettivo and società in _accomandita semplice or similar partnerships), a de facto non-commercial partnership or a professional_ association; - a non-commercial private or public institution, or a trust (other than Italian undertakings for collective investment) not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or - an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation, then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a tax withheld at source (imposta sostitutiva), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal of the Notes), unless the relevant Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the application of the risparmio gestito regime under Article 7 of Decree No. 461 (see also “—Tax treatment of capital gains—Discretionary investment portfolio regime _(Risparmio Gestito Regime)” below)._ Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes (being financial instruments issued by an Italian resident corporation) may be exempt from any income taxation (including the 26% imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016 (“Law No. 232”), in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018 (“Law No. 145”), in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124 of 26 October 2019 (“Law Decree No. 124”) and in Article 136 of Law Decree No. 34 of 19 May 2020 (“Decree No. 34/2020”), as amended and applicable from time to time. Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity In the event that the Italian-resident Noteholders mentioned above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be included in the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due. Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes, together with the coupons related thereto, are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva. Interest must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and is therefore subject to the general Italian corporate income taxation ( “IRES”, currently levied at the rate of 24% and, if applicable, any relevant additional surcharge, such as the additional 3.5% surcharge for banks and certain financial institutions) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder and also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”, generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even though regional surcharges may apply) (i.e., generally in the case of banks and financial institutions). Effective as of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that was current on December 31, 2015, Article 1(550) of Finance Act 2017 added paragraph 6-bis to Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, converted into Law No. 214 of December 22, 2011. Under this new rule, the base upon which the “Aiuto alla Crescita _Economica” benefit set forth in Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011 (ACE Benefit) is_ computed is reduced by an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari), including the Notes, other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements for the relevant fiscal year and (ii) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari) other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements of the fiscal year that was current on December 31, 2010. Only Italian resident persons carrying on an entrepreneurial activity (and in particular Italian resident corporations) and Italian permanent establishments of non-Italian resident persons can enjoy the ACE Benefit. The new restrictive rule enacted by Finance Act 2017 applies only to taxpayers different from those 315 ----- carrying out financial and insurance activities falling into section K of the ATECO classification of economic activities, other than non-financial holding companies. Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and real estate closed-ended investment companies (società di investimento a capitale fisso, or “SICAFs”), provided that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Italian authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediary) Interest is subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs If an Italian resident Noteholder is a non-real estate open-ended or a closed-ended collective investment fund (“Fund”) or an open-ended investment company (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAVs”) or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF or (ii) their manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes, together with the coupons related thereto, are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF. The Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at their level, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will be levied, in certain circumstances, by the Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV on income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distribution, redemption or disposal of the units/shares. Pension funds If an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes, together with the coupons related thereto, and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the results of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period (which will be subject to a 20% substitute tax). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di _risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232,_ in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124, and in Article 136 of Decree No. 34/2020, as amended and applicable from time to time. Application of the imposta sostitutiva Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, brokerage companies (società di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio (“SGR”), stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance or Italian permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary; and (b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Italian Intermediary paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due. 316 ----- _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ If the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident for tax purposes, without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the non-Italian resident Noteholder is: (a) a beneficial owner of the payment of the Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a State or territory included in the White List; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a State or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own State of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owner of the Interest (or certain non-resident institutional investors) and must deposit the Notes together with any related coupons since the issue date directly or indirectly with: (i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined below); or (ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Under certain conditions and limitations, Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains. In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, on capital gains, an Italian resident individual may opt– under certain conditions–for any of the three regimes described below. Tax return regime (Regime della dichiarazione) Under the “tax return regime”, which is the default regime for Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains of the same kind, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. Non-discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Amministrato Regime) As an alternative to the tax return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: - the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries (including permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediaries); and - an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the relevant Noteholder. 318 ----- The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up to the fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return. Discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Gestito Regime) In the Risparmio Gestito Regime, any capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said regime in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232, in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124, and in Article 136 of Decree No. 34/2020, as amended and applicable from time to time. Pursuant to Article 1, paragraphs 219-225 of Law no. 178 of 30 December 2020 (“Law No. 178”), it is further provided that Italian resident individuals investing, by 31 December 2021, in long-term individual savings account compliant with Article 13-bis, paragraph 2-bis of Law Decree No. 124 may benefit from a tax credit corresponding to possible capital losses, losses and negative differences realized in respect of certain qualifying financial instruments comprised in the long-term individual savings account, provided that certain conditions and requirements are met (e.g., including the loss of the possibility to subsequently set off the relevant capital losses, losses and negative differences against future capital gains). Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of non-Italian resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of Interest—Real estate investment funds and real estate _SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_ realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or disposal of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV, but income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or disposal of the units/shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%. 319 ----- Pension funds Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232, in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124, and in Article 136 of Decree No. 34/2020, as amended and applicable from time to time. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also certain multilateral trading facilities) in Italy or abroad are not subject to the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self- declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected). Pursuant to Article 5(5) of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), are not subject to the CGT, provided that the beneficial owner is: (a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a State or territory included in the White List and does not have a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a State or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own State of establishment and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate selfdeclaration of being an institutional investor; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree No. 239 (see “—Tax _treatment of interest”)._ If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident Noteholders without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_ capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. 320 ----- The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year (or at the end of the holding period) or, in the lack thereof, on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products held outside Italy or on the purchase value of any financial product (including the Notes) held abroad by Italian resident individuals.

The Notes are included in the definition of financial products for these purposes.

Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of financial account information. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. The first information exchanges are expected to begin in 2017. Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS and the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation, which provides for the exchange of information in relation to the calendar year 2016 and later. Law 95/2015 has been implemented by the Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015 which has been recently amended by the Italian Ministerial Decree dated 20 June 2019 and published in the Official Gazette on 9 July 2019. In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as meant in the Italian Ministerial Decree dated June 20, 2019), they may be required to provide additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian implementation of the CRS. As a consequence of the OECD project on “Base erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS), the EU DAC 6 Directive (“DAC 6”) has been adopted on May 25, 2018 by the EU Council, amending Council Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable crossborder arrangements. According to DAC 6, intermediaries and, in some circumstances, taxpayers are required to notify the competent tax authorities of each Member States any cross-border arrangements that have at least one of the so-called “hallmarks” designed by the EU legislator as “markers” of potential risk of international tax evasion or avoidance or circumvention of disclosure requirements on financial accounts (CRS). On August 26, 2020, the Legislative Decree No. 100, July 30, 2020 (the “DAC 6 Decree”), implementing the said Directive, with disclosure obligations for intermediaries and taxpayers, was published.

If a non-Italian resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank. The exemption from the imposta sostitutiva for non-Italian resident Noteholders is conditional upon: i. the timely deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a Second Level Bank; and ii. the timely submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it declares, inter alia, that it is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva. Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12, 2001, is valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need to be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was previously submitted to the same depository.

However, there are no tax authority guidelines directly regarding the Italian tax regime of payments on notes made by an Italian resident Guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative treatment of such payments or that the Italian courts would not support such an alternative treatment. In particular, according to a different interpretation, if a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of Interest on the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 600 of September 29, 1973 (currently at domestic rate of 26%), subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Post-Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such a position were taken and sustained, and the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the Post-Completion Merger were less than the principal amount of the “new” Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes could be treated as issued with OID or a greater amount of OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest generally will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.

As a result, U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. 325 ----- OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of _stated interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid_ (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense.

The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments generally would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments (including Italy) have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors therein, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, 323 ----- any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. 330 ----- Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori _concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534
624_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1393,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1393.2,Italy,1393.2.1,Limitation on granting of security interests and on enforcement under Italian law,"Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure or guarantee (as applicable) financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant 331 ----- security provider/grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial assistance In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such 332 ----- determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void. _Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_ In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each, an “Italian Guarantor”) may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, as regards to the Target, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement: (i) the Guarantee and security interests (if any) granted by the Target will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the Funding Loan) (or other financial support in any form, not including equity contributions) advanced from time to time to the Target (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests (if any) granted by the Target; provided that the Target shall be fully entitled to exercise any rights of set-off, recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) or other similar rights it may have by reason of any payment made by it under its Guarantee in respect of any obligations owed by the Issuer, against the payment obligations of the Target under any relevant intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support received by the Target, provided that the liability of the Target under its Guarantee shall not exceed the aggregate amount of any such intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support following the exercise of any such set-off rights; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Target, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of the Target under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively; and (v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest (if any) by the Target does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the Target and, therefore, does not fall within 333 ----- the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of the Target. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests (if any) granted by the Target be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests (if any) could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the Target, the Target will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/ or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. _The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. Trust_ The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the _rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders_ of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of 334 ----- the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable _subordination” rule._ 335 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian insolvency law considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; 336 ----- - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian Usury Law; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; 337 ----- - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which substantially reforms the Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (the “Liquidity Decree”), as converted by Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020, and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named _Parte Prima-Titolo II (i.e., the new preventive alert and mediation phase), which will entry into force on_ 338 ----- December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to corporate groups. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”). If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. 339 ----- Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any). Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with in the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; 340 ----- (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law without the need for an independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided thereby. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called _Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure._ Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione _dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta_ amministrativa),_ extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione _straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under_ Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The petition for concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day_ following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a 341 ----- prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force August 21, 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale); and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_ law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. 342 ----- The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/ or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi_ di ristrutturazione dei debiti) The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione), in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, writeoffs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ 343 ----- The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors are not treated worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations and have been kept informed). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. 344 ----- Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or approval (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to: (i) incur in new super senior indebtedness subject to authorization by the court; (ii) secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the approval (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors; and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to Article 182 quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. _Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato _preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_ date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato _preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._ The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 345 ----- 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182- bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the concordato in bianco, as well as the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, are treated as super-senior (so called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security_ interests granted are exempted from the claw- back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di _pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the_ proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. 346 ----- The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest—as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders—to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_ or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement court-supervised composition with creditors aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). 347 ----- To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and approved (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. _Impacts of the Covid-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_ In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the Covid-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the Covid-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an_ extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a _concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities_ were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the Covid-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations. 348 ----- _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore _fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the_ relevant timing in his or her decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one 349 ----- year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part, provided that they do not receive less than the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert). The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori pignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. - Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of 350 ----- receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner. a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and ii. granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. c. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato _preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective 351 ----- with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provides for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser. Finally, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese_ in stato di insolvenza). The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the judicial receiver’s report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_ insolvenza) Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those 352 ----- from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_ (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Interim financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_ expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato _preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_ expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to 353 ----- (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a Guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis –à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. 354 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it stands now. The main innovations of the Law Decree 118/2021 are the following: (i) additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code; (ii) introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio); (iii) amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code. The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato per la _liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical consequences of_ the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety. The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the court to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Please see the sections entitled “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer has agreed to indemnify each Initial Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that any Initial Purchaser may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain fees and expenses relating to the offering of the Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date as specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+ ). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. 356 ----- Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates (including their parent companies) have from time to time performed, and in the future may perform, lending advisory, certain investment banking and/or other financial services for us, our affiliates or our former affiliates, in the ordinary course of business to the Issuer (including its parent and group companies) for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer in an arm’s length transaction and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections attached to their clients, nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as arrangers under the Revolving Credit Facility and as arrangers and original lenders under certain commitments that we have entered into in connection with the financing for the Acquisition. In connection with their services in such capacities, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates will receive customary fees and commissions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates act as arrangers and lenders under certain of the Target Refinanced Indebtedness, which will be repaid in connection with the Transactions (including with a portion of the proceeds of the Offering). Funds, limited partnerships or other entities managed by or otherwise advised by the Sponsor or any independent debt funds or entities managed by or advised by the Sponsor or other affiliates of the Sponsor may place a purchase order for and be allocated Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, subject to a pass through or payment to such persons on the Initial Purchasers’ discount in respect of the Notes purchased by such persons. 357 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Set up in 1999 in Varese as NGI, the company’s core business is the supply of wireless connectivity services. In 2007, it developed a wireless broadband internet access service marketed under the “EOLO” brand (which then became the company’s name in 2016). At the forefront of the search for innovative technological solutions to eliminate the digital divide, EOLO’s mission is to guarantee the right to connectivity focusing on the individual in order to improve their quality of life and create value for businesses.

EOLO provides its services using its proprietary TLC infrastructure comprising fibre optic and radio transmission nodes located throughout Italy. Its network is developed in northern and central Italy while a massive investment plan was rolled out in 2019 to expand intensively into southern Italy. The company complied with the guidelines provided by the government and competent authorities in order to deal with Covid-19 epidemiological emergency. In order to guarantee its ability to ensure business continuity, the company kept its employees and consultants up to date with any new information and urged its employees to work from home when possible while concurrently safeguarding those employees who continued to come into work as it was impossible for them to work remotely. Except as indicated above, no other significant impact on operations due to Covid-19 occurred EOLO has provided all its employees at the head office and those engaged in network maintenance work around the country with personal protective equipment (PPE).

This interim financial information as at and for the three months ended 30 June 2021 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 – Interim financial reporting, endorsed by European Union, and does not contain all the information and notes required for annual financial statements. It should, therefore, be read together with the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2021. However, although this interim financial information does not contain all the disclosures of a complete set of financial statements, it does include all an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the financial position and performance since the end of the last annual reporting period. The statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows are prepared in Euros (the company’s functional currency) without decimal points. The figures in the statement of changes in equity and these notes are prepared in thousands of Euros, unless specified otherwise. The required captions with nil balances for both the current and comparative periods have not been included in the financial information. _Condensed interim financial information at 30 June 2021_ If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the company measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price - i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the company determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

These judgements and estimates are based on information available at the date of preparation of the financialinformation, management’s experience and other relevant information. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are used to measure assets, amortisation and depreciation, assess the recoverability deferred tax assets, recognise loss allowances and measure employee benefits and contingent liabilities using actuarial techniques. Management revisits the estimates and judgements regularly and the effects of any changes are shown in profit or loss. Critical measurement processes and key judgements used to apply the IFRS and the main sources of uncertainty in estimates have not changed since those described in the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2021. Management checks the estimates and judgements regularly. They are based on past experience and other factors, including expectations about future events that could have an impact on the company’s financial position and are considered reasonable in the circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the company’s accounting policies and disclosure obligations require the measurement of fair values for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

The liability for this LTIP amounts to €16,306 thousand (including the relevant portion of the related costs), up €1,439 thousand on 31 March 2021. At 31 March 2021, it was classified under non-current liabilities and was reclassified at 30 June 2021 under current liabilities for employee benefits since EOLO’s ownership is expected to change in the short term, and this will trigger payment of the payments. Under this plan, beneficiaries are awarded a bonus (€2,670 thousand at 30 June 2021) which is included in their remuneration. This bonus is calculated using a multiplier mechanism based on the increase in the company’s value compared to a benchmark defined in the plan regulation. In addition, the plan has various payment options (including partial options) including should the company’s shares be sold (cash-settled), the company be listed (equity-settled) or upon the benefits’ natural maturity date (cash-settled). The company engaged an external expert to estimate the plan’s fair value. This expert applied the relevant valuation criteria and calculated the plan’s fair value to be the present value (at each reference date) of the remuneration streams to be paid to the beneficiaries using the binomial model. The expert also considered an estimate of the company’s enterprise value at the reporting date compared to the benchmark defined in the plan regulation. The estimate of the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2021 and 30 June 2021 considered the directors’ assessment of the expected change in ownership in the short term as well as, given the reference context, an enterprise value at the reporting date calculated using a market comparables approach, and the status of the negotiations. As a result, the estimated vesting periods were revised. The estimated fair value at 30 June 2021 is equal to €17.355 million, unchanged compared to 31 March 2021. Sensitivity analyses show that the plan’s fair value is sensitive to changes in the estimate of the company’s enterprise value at the reference dates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed when incurred. _(b.3) Depreciation_ Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is derecognised. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its estimated realisable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates: - Buildings 3% - Network systems and equipment 10% - 20% - Assets under free loan 20% - 50% Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use the company’s connectivity services and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the related contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet depreciated is expensed These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated. Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment. When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant obsolescence, the company compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the present value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary. If the conditions for the recognition of the impairment loss are no longer valid in subsequent years, the loss is reversed up to the carrying amount the asset would have had (net of depreciation) had the impairment loss never been recognised. _(b.4) Impairment losses on non-financial assets_ When a non-financial asset shows indication of impairment at the reporting date, the company estimates its recoverable amount, defined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, applying the following definitions: - Value in use: this is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU). Specifically, the asset will generate cash flows, which will be discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. The cash flows are determined using internal business plans based on detailed budgets and calculations prepared separately for each asset/cash-generating unit. The budgets do not include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a horizon of a maximum of five years. - Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company uses valuation models based on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators. F-48 ----- _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ IAS 36 does not require a formal estimate of the recoverable amount if there are no indicators of impairment. The exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, the company recognises a loss equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, the company checks whether the reasons for recognising an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if not, estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of goodwill, if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. The reversal is recognised through profit or loss. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ The company has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the carrying amount of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. It measures the right-of-use asset considering the amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the date of initial recognition. The company depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers title to the underlying asset at the end of the lease term or, given the cost of the right-of-use asset, the company expects to exercise the purchase option. In this case, the company depreciates the right-of-use asset over its useful life determined using the same criteria as per property, plant and equipment. Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognised in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _(d.1) Trade receivables and other assets_ Trade receivables and other assets (other financial assets) are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost and initially recognised at their transaction cost for trade receivables and their fair value for other assets, which is usually their nominal amount. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost net of any identified impairment losses. The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable using the present value of the discounted cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The company considers reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes quantitative and qualitative information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well as forward-looking information. _(d.2) Current and non-current loans and borrowings_ Advances and loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are classified as current or non-current liabilities based on their settlement date. _(d.3) Trade payables and other liabilities_ Trade payables and other liabilities (other financial liabilities), with due dates within normal commercial terms, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ The discount rates do not reflect the risks for which future cash flows have been adjusted. The company regularly reviews the provisions to reflect changes in the estimate of the costs, the payment/ settlement timing and the discount rate. Changes in the estimates are recognised in the same caption of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the provision or, when the liability relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, as a balancing entry to the related asset. Provisions include accruals for future costs of ongoing disputes and the present value of the costs to be incurred to restore land used under lease. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss and presented within financial expense. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the company’s business plans. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. _Financial statements at 31 March 2021_ _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ Land is not depreciated, even when it is acquired together with a building. The gain or loss on the sale of property, plant, machinery, equipment or other assets is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the derecognition. _(b.2) Subsequent expenditure_ Subsequent expenditure and the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment are added to the item’s carrying amount and capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the related item increase. All other costs are expensed when incurred. When the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment is capitalised, the carrying amount of the parts that are replaced is expensed. The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed when incurred. _(b.3) Depreciation_ Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is derecognised. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its estimated realisable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates: - Buildings 3% - Network systems and equipment 10% - 20% - Assets under free loan 20% - 50% Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use the company’s connectivity services and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the related contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet depreciated is expensed. These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated. Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment. When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant obsolescence, the company compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the present value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary.

The budgets do not include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a horizon of a maximum of five years. - Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company uses valuation models based on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators. IAS 36 does not require a formal estimate of the recoverable amount if there are no indicators of impairment. The exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, the company recognises a loss equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, the company checks whether the reasons for recognising an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if not, estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of goodwill, if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. The reversal is recognised through profit or loss. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. As required by IFRS 16, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in the statement of financial position. . The company recognises right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in the specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease liabilities” in the statement of financial position. At the lease commencement date, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest, reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or when the company changes its assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it. The company has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the carrying amount of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. In order to apply the modified retrospective approach to the above leases, the company has adopted the practical expedient to rely on past experience to determine the lease term. At the date of initial recognition, the company measured the lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments that were not paid at that date, discounted using its incremental borrowing rate at 1 April 2018. It measured right-of-use assets considering the amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before this date. Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognised in accordance with IAS 36— Impairment of assets. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the company considers: - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; - prepayment and extension features; and - terms that limit the company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non-recourse features). The company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _(d.1) Trade receivables and other assets_ Trade receivables and other assets (other financial assets) are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost and initially recognised at their transaction cost for trade receivables and their fair value for other assets, which is usually their nominal amount.

Following the amendments to Italian post-employment benefits (“TFR”) by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and regulations (the pension reform) issued early in 2007: - TFR vested up until 31 December 2006 is treated as a defined benefit plan under IAS 19. The benefits earned by employees in the form of post-employment benefits, paid when the employment relationship ends, are recognised over the vesting period; - TFR accrued after 1 January 2007 is treated as a defined contribution plan and benefits accrued during the year are entirely recognised as a cost, while the benefits not yet paid into the fund are recognised under “Other current liabilities”. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ - the duration of the contract with customer has been defined on the basis of the contract term agreed with the customer (mainly 24 months); - the company has identified a single performance obligation for its connectivity services; it does not account for the performance obligations related to the other services provided with its connectivity services separately, as their separate accounting would not alter how it recognises revenue; - the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the customer, including any promotions, covering the entire contract term.; - the company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price. Revenue from nonrefundable up-front activation fees, which do not constitute a separate performance obligation and do not convey a material right to customers, is deferred over the contract term; - the company recognises revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. It usually invoices revenues and collects payment on a two-monthly basis in advance. Contracts with non-business customers generally provide for advance payment, which is not considered a significant financing component given that advance payment is normal business practice and average payments are usually made over less than 12 months. _(n.2) Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil a contract_ The incremental costs of obtaining a contract, comprising commissions paid to agents and brokers, are recognised in profit or loss over the contract term (24 months). The costs to fulfil a contract, including the cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio transceiver at a new customer, are recognised over the contract term (24 months). The costs of initial installation are recognised in “Property, plant and equipment”. Should the contract be terminated, the incremental costs of obtaining the contract and the costs to fulfil it are expensed. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer creditimpaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ Standards not yet endorsed by the EU include: 1.

The right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest, reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or when the company changes its assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The company’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to: - physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals; - multi-year rights to use fibre optic sections (dark fibre IRU); - office buildings; - company cars; - data centre equipment and other assets (canteen equipment). The company elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Therefore, it recognises the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under the new definition of IFRS 16, which establishes that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. The company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in the statement of financial position. The company recognises right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in the specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease liabilities” in the statement of financial position. F-49 ----- IFRS 16 redefines how to recognise a lease. It replaces IAS 17 - Leases, IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 - Operating leases - Incentives and SIC-27 - Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The standard also provides exemptions for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The company’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to: - physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals; - multi-year rights to use fibre optic sections (dark fibre IRU); - office buildings; - company cars; - data centre equipment and other assets (canteen equipment). The company elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Therefore, it recognises the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach in its financial statements at 31 March 2020. Therefore, the effects of initially applying the standard have been recognised at 1 April 2018 with the recognition of right-of-use assets and other lease liabilities. The company has depreciated the right-of-use assets and recognised financial expense on the lease liabilities. In accordance with IFRS 16, the company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under its new definition, which establishes that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right the control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., when the company becomes a contractual party to the financial instrument. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, at initial recognition, the company measures a financial asset at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price. For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the company considers: - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; - prepayment and extension features; and - terms that limit the company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non- recourse features). The company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans that are not defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans may be unfunded or they may be wholly or partly funded by the contributions by an entity, and sometimes its employees, into an entity or fund, that is legally separate from the reporting entity and from which the employee benefits are paid. The vested amount is projected into the future to estimate the amount to be paid upon termination of the employment relationship and subsequently discounted to consider the time value of money before effective payment. Adjustments to the liability for employee benefits are determined using actuarial assumptions, based on demographic and financial variables, recognised on an accruals basis in line with the service necessary to obtain the benefit.

The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the company’s accounting policies and disclosure obligations require the measurement of fair values for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the company measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the company determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

The expert also considered an estimate of the company’s enterprise value at the reporting date compared to the benchmark defined in the plan regulation. Specifically, the expert calculated the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2020 assuming the benefits would be settled at their natural maturity date and using an enterprise value at that date estimated using the discounted cash flow method (WACC of 8.48%) and the 2021-2025 business plan prepared by the company’s directors. The expert’s estimate of the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2021 considered the directors’ assessment of the possible change in ownership in the short term as well as, given the reference context, an enterprise value at the reporting date calculated using a market comparables approach, and the status of the negotiations. As a result, the estimated vesting periods were revised. The main parameters used to apply this model are summarised below: **31/03/2021** **31/03/2020** Total benefits vested . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The company introduced a five-year long-term incentive plan (LTIP) on 1 September 2018 for its directors and/ or managers and/or key employees. Under this plan, beneficiaries are awarded a bonus (€2,670 thousand at 31 March 2021) which is included in their remuneration. This bonus is calculated using a multiplier mechanism based on the increase in the company’s value compared to a benchmark defined in the plan regulation. In addition, the plan has various payment options (including partial options) including should the company’s shares be sold (cash-settled), the company be listed (equity-settled) or upon the benefits’ natural maturity date (cash-settled).

The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The company considers reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes quantitative and qualitative information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well as forward-looking information. The company regularly checks its exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and takes suitable mitigation actions when necessary. Specifically, its policies provide that it sends reminders or collection notices for past-due receivables. These actions are considered when calculating the loss allowance. The loss allowance for cash and cash equivalents is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected losses. These impairment losses are calculated on short-term exposures. The company considers the credit risk related to its cash and cash equivalents to be low given its banks’ credit ratings. It has not recognised impairment losses on other non-derivative financial assets (trade receivables) during the year. F-75 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

The proceeding started with a report filed by a competitor, Linkem S.p.A., on 14 October 2016, alleging the unauthorised use of radio frequencies, and hence the allegations are theft (article 624.2 of the Criminal Code), fraud (article 640.2.1 of the Criminal Code) and disruption of the freedom of trade or industry (article 513 of the Criminal Code). The latter allegation has been dismissed and, on 25 January 2021, the public prosecutor requested that the other two allegations of involvement in crimes as per article 110 of the Criminal Code be dismissed. On 15 February 2021, Linkem S.p.A. appealed as per article 410 of the Criminal Code against the dismissal application. At the date of preparation of this report, a date for the hearing before the preliminary investigation judge of the Busto Arsizio Court has not been set.

Contingent liabilities,29.469.1,,"The company and some of its employees are involved in an ongoing criminal proceeding with respect to the liability of entities under Legislative decree no. 231/2001.

On 25 July 2019, the public prosecutor requested that the crime covered by article 513 of the Criminal Code be dismissed. None of the parties allegedly injured by that crime has opposed the request for its dismissal although they were regularly informed of this as per article 408 of the Criminal Code. As no oppositions have been received, the preliminary investigation judge referred to the arguments presented in the precautionary attachment order and ordered the dismissal of the allegation about the disruption of the freedom of trade and industry “as there is no case to answer”. On 9 July 2019, the amount of €3,537,074.09, which had been subjected to precautionary attachment in December 2018, was credited to one of the company’s bank accounts.

Transition to the IFRS,29.472.1,EOLO S.p.A.,"_Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ In addition, as required by IFRS 1 - First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting standards, the company has referred to IFRS 1.IG.63 to present a reconciliation between the amounts determined in accordance with the OIC and those redetermined in accordance with the IFRS both at the date of transition (1 April 2018) and 31 March 2019 together with notes explaining the adjustments. Specifically, it prepared: - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019; - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2019; - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS equity as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019; - the company’s accounting policies, which show its elections in applying the IFRS; - notes to the reconciliation schedules. _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ disclosures in accordance with the OIC are no longer relevant due to the company’s adoption of different accounting policies with its transition to the IFRS. In this case, the estimates were not updated to reflect information received subsequently. Changes in estimates that are appropriate are recognised prospectively. (2) Classification and measurement of financial instruments, derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment losses on financial assets The company has applied IFRS 9 prospectively from the date of transition to the IFRS (1 April 2018). (3) Embedded derivatives The company has assessed whether to separate embedded derivatives from their host contracts and account for them as derivatives based on the conditions that existed at the more recent of the following two dates: the date on which the company became a party to the contract and the date of any change in the contract terms that significantly modifies the contract’s cash flows. It concluded that it did not have embedded derivatives that needed to be separated from their host contracts. (4) Government grants At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company had not received government grants. Therefore, this exception was not applicable. (5) Hedge accounting At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company did not have transactions that would qualify for hedge accounting under the IFRS. (6) Non-controlling interests At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company did not have business combinations with non-controlling interests carried out in previous years. Therefore, this exception was not applicable. (7) Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures and assets and liabilities of the parent The parent, Cometa S.p.A., adopted the IFRS on 1 April 2018 (date of transition of its subsidiary to the IFRS). (8) Investment entities The company is not an investment entity and, therefore, this exception was not applicable. _(a.4) Application of exemptions_ The company considered all the exemptions provided for by IFRS 1 as set out below: (1) Revenue The company has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effects in opening equity at the date of initial application (1 April 2018 - the date of transition to the IFRS), without using any of the practical expedients provided for by IFRS 15.C5. (2) Contracts that contain a lease The company has applied IFRS 16 retrospectively and, therefore, it recognised the cumulative effect of its adoption on 1 April 2018 (the date of transition) by recognising additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. F-127 ----- _Financial statements at 31 March 2020_ (3) Other exemptions After considering the other exemptions granted by IFRS 1, the company found that they were not applicable to its statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Specifically, the adjustments to ensure compliance with the IFRS in force at 31 March 2020 (IFRS first reporting date) were applied to the opening statement of financial position as at 1 April 2018 (the date of transition to the IFRS) and the financial statements at 31 March 2019 (comparative period), unless stated otherwise. The transition to the IFRS is effectively a change in accounting policies and, therefore, as required by IFRS 1, its effects are presented in opening equity at the date of transition (1 April 2018). The company has complied with all the standards when preparing these financial statements. _(a.2) First-time adoption of the IFRS_ The company has prepared its opening statement of financial position at the date of transition to the IFRS (1 April 2018) in accordance with IFRS 1.10, except for the exceptions and exemptions provided for by the same standard and detailed later in this section, by: - recognising all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by the IFRS; - not recognising items as assets or liabilities if the IFRS do not permit such recognition; - reclassifying items that it recognised in accordance with the OIC as one type of asset, liability or component of equity, but are a different type of asset, liability or component of equity in accordance with the IFRS; - applying the IFRS in measuring all recognised assets and liabilities. The company has elected to restate the opening statement of financial statement as at 1 April 2018 and the financial statements at 31 March 2019 as follows: (a) assets and liabilities are recognised as current or noncurrent; (b) costs are classified by nature in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; (c) cash flows are presented using the indirect method. _(a.3) Application of exceptions_ The company has considered all exceptions provide for by IFRS 1 as set out below: (1) Estimates The company’s estimates at the date of transition to the IFRS (1 April 2018) and at 31 March 2019 are consistent with the estimates made for the same dates in accordance with the OIC, except when the estimates and related F-126 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,534

Unlike the practice under the OIC, the related liability is calculated using actuarial techniques that consider when the employees will leave the company, their remuneration over their period of service and the fact that payment of the benefits is deferred (discounting). An independent expert has measured the liability for the defined benefit plan using actuarial techniques. Therefore, the company has adjusted its future obligation generating: - an increase in post-employment benefits and a decrease in equity of €278 thousand and €451 thousand at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, respectively; - a decrease of €40 thousand in personnel expenses at 31 March 2019; - an increase of €31 thousand in interest expense; - a decrease of €181 thousand in other comprehensive expense at 31 March 2019. _(ii) Incentive plan_ In accordance with IFRS 2, cash-settled share-based payment plans are part of the remuneration package of the beneficiaries. Therefore, the cost, which is the fair value of the instruments, is recognised under “Personnel expenses” over the period from the award date to the vesting date, with an increase in the related liability. The company remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss under personnel expenses. Therefore, the company has reclassified the liability to employee benefits generating: - an increase in employee benefits and a decrease in equity of €168 thousand at 31 March 2019; - an increase of €168 thousand in personnel expenses at 31 March 2019.
