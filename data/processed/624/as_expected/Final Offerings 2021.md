###### Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A.
**€375.0 million 4** **[7]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2028**

Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its
4.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”) as part of the financing for its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Eolo S.p.A., a società per azioni incorporated under the
laws of Italy (the “Target”). See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate of 4.875 % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each March 31 and September 30, commencing on March 31, 2022.
Prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or any portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus a “make whole” premium. In addition, prior to
September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional
Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding, the date of redemption. Furthermore, prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the
net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original principal amount of
the Notes remains outstanding. At any time on or after September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering
Memorandum. The Notes will mature on October 21, 2028.
In addition, in the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for either series of Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other
holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to
make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date (as defined herein), deposit the
gross proceeds from the Offering into a segregated escrow account, in the name of the Issuer (the “Escrow Account”). The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent
(as defined herein) and pledged in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrowed Property (as defined herein) from the
Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (as defined
herein) promptly following the release of the funds from the Escrow Account. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein). The
Special Mandatory Redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of such Special Mandatory Redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
Following the Acquisition Closing Date (as defined herein), we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any
competent authority, to merge the Issuer with the Target in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law and as further described herein, with MergerCo (as defined herein)
being the surviving entity (the “Post-Completion Merger”) during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date. The Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain
conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion
_Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility (as defined herein).

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. In the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the date falling 18 months following the Acquisition
Closing Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and to certain
significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to certain
perfection requirements, by the Escrowed Property. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, by the Completion Collateral (as defined herein). Within 20 Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Completion Collateral (as defined herein). Each of the Escrowed Property, the Completion Collateral and
the Post-Completion Collateral is further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral (as defined herein) will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging obligations (if any) on a pari passu basis. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), and subject to applicable laws, in the event of an
enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will be treated as pari passu among each other, although they will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, and to applicable laws, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Guarantee (as defined herein) and the Collateral will be subject to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable law as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and
_the Security Interests.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations_
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_
This Offering Memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants, events of default and
transfer restrictions. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the
Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree
**No. 239”), if the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the circumstances**
as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” within the meaning of Article 2(e) of
Prospectus Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation. The Notes described in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (as
defined above) in a Member State. No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in a Member State has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in a Member State may be unlawful.

Each person located in a Member State to whom any offer of Notes is made, or who receives any communication
in respect of an offer of Notes, or who initially acquires any Notes, or to whom the Notes are otherwise made
available, will be deemed to have represented, warranted, acknowledged and agreed to and with each Initial
Purchaser and the Issuer that (i) it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of the law in that Member State
implementing Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; and (ii) it is not a retail investor (as defined above).

**_EEA product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes of each_**
manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Republic of Italy. The Offering has not been cleared by the Commissione Nazionale per la Società e la Borsa_**
(“CONSOB”) (the Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities legislation and will not

v


-----

be subject to formal review or clearance by CONSOB. Accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered,
directly or indirectly nor may copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other offering circular, prospectus,
form of application, advertisement or other offering material or document relating to the Notes to be issued, may
be distributed or published in the Republic of Italy either on the primary or on the secondary market, except
(a) to qualified investors (investitori qualificati) as referred to in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; or
(b) in any other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the
Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter, first paragraph, letter (b) of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14,
1999, as amended (the “Issuer Regulation”), and the applicable Italian laws and regulations.

Any such offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other
document relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy must be in compliance with the selling restrictions under
(a) and (b) above and must be:

(a) made by soggetti abilitati (including investment firms, banks or financial intermediaries, as defined by
Article 1, first paragraph, letter r, of Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended
(the “Italian Financial Act”)), to the extent duly authorized to engage in the placement and/or underwriting
and/or purchase of financial instruments in the Republic of Italy in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Italian Financial Act, Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended (“Regulation 20307”),
Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended (the “Italian Banking Act”), the
Issuer Regulation and any other applicable laws and regulations; and

(b) in compliance with all relevant Italian securities, tax, exchange control and any other applicable laws and
regulations and any other applicable requirement or limitation that may be imposed from time to time by
CONSOB, the Bank of Italy (including, the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to
Article 129 of the Italian Banking Act and the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended
from time to time) or any other relevant Italian competent authorities.

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes by such
investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

For selling restrictions in respect of Italy, see also “Notice to Certain European Investors—European Economic
_Area” above._

**_United Kingdom. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in_**
the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of such securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation. The securities described in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore,
offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only
directed at, persons who (i) are outside the UK, (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005, as amended, (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to
(d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iv) are
persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21
of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all
such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at
relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment
or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will
be engaged in only with relevant persons. The Notes are being offered solely to “qualified investors” as defined
in the UK Prospectus Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by the Financial Conduct
Authority or any other competent authority. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on
this Offering Memorandum or any of its content.

**_UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market. Solely for the purposes_**
of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only ECPs, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**ITALIAN “WHITE LIST”**

In order to qualify as eligible to receive interest free from imposta sostitutiva (Italian substitute tax), among other
things, non-Italian resident holders of the Notes and beneficial interests therein must be beneficial owners
resident for tax purposes in, or be “institutional investors” established in, a country which the Italian government
identifies as allowing for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (the “White List”) as listed in the
Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in
which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Legislative Decree No. 239 of
April 1, 1996 is effective, in a country therein included. See “Taxation—Certain Italian Tax Considerations—
_Tax Treatment of the Notes Issued by the Issuer—Tax Treatment of Interest—Non-Italian Resident Noteholders.”_

Subject to certain limited exceptions, such as for central banks and supranational bodies established in
accordance with international agreements in force in Italy, this residency requirement applies to all holders of the
Notes and beneficial interests therein, including ultimate beneficiaries of interest payments under the Notes
holding via sub-accounts to which interests in the Notes may be allocated upon purchase or thereafter.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the White List includes the following States:

Albania Colombia Hungary Netherlands Tanzania
Alderney Czech Republic Iceland Nigeria Thailand

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about our strategy,
investment program, future operations, industry forecasts, expected acquisitions, transactions and investments
(including the Acquisition), and target levels of leverage and indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide
our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements
about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements
of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives
of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not
necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on
potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or
implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our
forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even
if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum,
those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For
example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not
limited to:

    - Risks related to obtaining all licenses, permits, right of use or other authorizations;

    - Inability to attract and retain subscribers;

    - Failure of our systems and controls;

    - Inability to provide telecommunication or related services and investment to remain competitive and
relevant;

    - Risk of illiquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs or on-going operations;

    - Risk of liability and sanctions of offenses committed by persons within EOLO;

    - Liabilities incurred by the actions of our directors, employees, agents and representatives;

    - Risks associated with the development, expansion and maintenance of our FWA network;

    - Inability to successfully compete with the high levels of competition;

    - Risks related to key relationships with third parties which we depend on;

    - Adverse impact due to regulatory measures;

    - Risks related to our ability to maintain existing network infrastructure or install new network
infrastructure;

    - Adverse impact on our reputation, business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations due
to damage, security breaches or cyberattacks to key information technology systems;

    - Inability to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent others from using such rights without
authorization;

    - Inability to attract and retain key personnel, directors, managers, employees or individuals to
effectively manage our business;

    - Negative impacts from lack of growth in market demand for FWA services;

    - Adverse impact of disruptive geopolitical or macroeconomic events and economic uncertainty;

    - Decreased internet usage, litigation or stricter regulation due to actual or perceived health risks relating
to telecommunication transmission equipment;

    - Adverse impact of labor disputes or work stoppages;

ix


-----

    - Adverse impact of disputes and legal, tax and regulatory proceedings;

    - Adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other health epidemics and outbreaks;

    - Adverse impact of negative impacts on the reputation of our brand name;

    - Risks related to uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage and unanticipated changes
in insurance costs;

    - Risks related to changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy;

    - Inability to market and sell products or develop new products due to unsuccessful advertising and
promotional activities;

    - Adverse impact of competition and antitrust laws;

    - Risks related to third parties claiming we infringed their intellectual property rights;

    - Adverse impact of additional tax expense or exposure;

    - Risks associated with estimates and assumptions relevant to our calculation of Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA;

    - Risks related to the Transactions;

    - Risks related to our capital structure;

    - Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral; and

    - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering
Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations
and liquidity. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor
can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of
risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this Offering
Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us
or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum.
As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which
we operate are based on market data, statistical information, sector reports and third-party studies as well as on
our own estimates.

We operate in an industry in which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. In drafting
this Offering Memorandum, we used industry sources, market research, publicly available information, industry
publications and sources of market data, such as reports prepared by third party consulting firms. To the extent
that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this
Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these
third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or
misleading. Market studies and analyses are, however, frequently based on information and assumptions that
may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. We
have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in the studies, publications
and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We
therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party
sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our estimates
are based.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that
cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own
market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or
internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from
such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our
own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations
are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them.
They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other independent sources.

Certain market-related information reproduced in this Offering Memorandum, such as market shares and number
of households, is based on reports prepared by various third-party consulting firms, which have used different
underlying assumptions or sources in preparing their reports, including the number of subscribers, and, as such,
some of the data may differ from each other. In many cases, there is no readily available external information
(whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses
and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industries in which
we operate, our position in the relevant industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry
participants based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry
publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. Neither we nor any of the
Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take any responsibility for, such data.
Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any
independent sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy
of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are
subject to change based on various factors. See “Risk factors,” “Industry” and “Business” for further discussion
regarding our industry and market data and the risks related thereto.

Unless specified otherwise, market shares presented in this Offering Memorandum are presented as of March 31,
2021 and are based on revenues and not on the number of subscribers.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**General - Financial Statements Presented**

The Issuer was incorporated on June 18, 2021, in connection with the Transactions. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no
business operations, material assets or material liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its
incorporation and the Transactions, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions. As a
result, no financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited
“as adjusted” financial data presented on a basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. Prior to
the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those
related to the Transactions and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture.

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Target. Accordingly,
unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” or “our” in respect of historical financial information in this
Offering Memorandum are to the Target.

This Offering Memorandum includes:

(i) our unaudited condensed interim financial information as of and for the three months ended June 30,
2021, which include unaudited comparative financial data for the three months ended June 30, 2020,
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”
(the “Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information”); and

(ii) our audited financial statements as of and for each of the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021,
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Audited Financial Statements” and,
together with the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information, the “Financial Statements”).

On April 1, 2020, we adopted IFRS. For prior periods, we had prepared our financial statements in accordance
with Italian GAAP. Our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019 were prepared in accordance
with the Italian GAAP and the financial information in respect of such period was restated in our audited
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 to reflect the adoption of IFRS. Our financial statements
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP have not been included
in this Offering Memorandum. Therefore, the financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019
included and discussed in this Offering Memorandum is that presented as comparative information in our audited
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 which was not covered by the audit reports included
therein.

In the future, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Acquisition Closing Date but
prior to the Merger Date to holders of the Notes at the level of the Issuer in accordance with IFRS. Following the
Post-Completion Merger, we will report our financial results in respect of periods following the Merger Date to
holders of the Notes at the level of EOLO in accordance with IFRS.

Our financial statements in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any
changes to the statements of profit and loss and comprehensive income, statements of financial position or cash
flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the
Transactions. However, the Issuer (prior to the Merger Date) and MergerCo (following the Merger Date), as
applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will
apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for
accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could
result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our
statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer
relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also recognize additional amortization and depreciation
expenses related to the additional assets recognized. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future
financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to
our financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and
the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional
advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could
affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

-----

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and
estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Financial Statements. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Accounting
_Policies—Critical accounting policies.”_

**Unaudited Financial Information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021**

This Offering Memorandum also presents and discusses unaudited financial information of the Target for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021. This information has been derived by adding the results of operations for the
three months ended June 30, 2021, to the results of operations for the year ended March 30, 2021, and subtracting
the results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2020, derived from the comparative column
included in the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information. The unaudited financial information for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021 presented herein has not been audited, is not required by or presented in
accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and may not necessarily be representative of our results for any future period. We believe that the
financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 is a useful indicator of our ability to develop
our business and operating cash flow and to serve our indebtedness. We present this information as it is the basis
for certain ratios and as adjusted financial information included in this Offering Memorandum that we believe is
useful as supplemental measures for investors in assessing the impact of the Transactions and our ability to incur
and service our debt, including the Notes.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited as adjusted financial information for the Issuer as of
and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, which is based on our financial information, on an as adjusted
basis to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the
Group as at and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. See “Summary Historical and Certain Other
_Financial Data—Other Financial Information and As Adjusted Data” and “Capitalization.” This as adjusted_
financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual
interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on July 1, 2020 or what our actual cash position
or indebtedness would have been had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2021, nor does it purport to project
our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial information has
not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the
Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the
adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Non-IFRS Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any
other generally accepted accounting principles. We refer to these measures as “non-IFRS measures” as they
exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable
measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are
not calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, we present certain financial measures of the Target and
ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, and other measures and ratios that are not recognized by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Measures”). We use such measures to assess
the operating financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe that these and similar measures are
used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as supplemental
measures of financial performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of
operations, profitability and ability to service debt.

In particular, given certain one-off transactions that have had a significant impact on EOLO S.p.A.’s profit or
loss statement, the growth in our subscriber base and the extensive investments in network expansion that have
been made during the periods under review, EOLO’s management monitors Reported EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA (each of which is defined below) for purposes of internal capital
allocation decision-making and budget planning. The foregoing are presented in this Offering Memorandum
because EOLO’s management believes that they can assist readers to understand the underlying dynamics of the
core business operations of EOLO S.p.A., and that they provide meaningful and relevant financial information
that is useful in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s operations in the same manner as EOLO’s management views and

operates the business. EOLO’s management presents the foregoing Non-IFRS Measures because similar
measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures
of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations and ability to
service debt. In addition, EOLO’s management believes that Operating Free Cash Flow is a useful Non-IFRS
Measure to use in evaluating business performance and to inform future expenditure planning because it
illustrates cash generation on a basis that is comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure,
permitting EOLO’s management to analyze the business in a consistent manner. Furthermore, EOLO’s
management believes that Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a relevant Non-IFRS Measure that
can assist in capital allocation and planning operating and capital expenditures based on ability of the business to
generate cash.

Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the
Target’s operating results as reported under IFRS.

A more detailed explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS Measures, a reconciliation of the
non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS
and a discussion of their limitations is set out elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical
_and Certain Other Financial Data—As Adjusted Financial Information.” We do not regard these Non-IFRS_
Measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with
IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS.

Non-IFRS Measures that we use in this Offering Memorandum are defined as follows:

     - “Reported EBITDA” is defined as profit/(loss) for the year before income taxes, financial income
and financial expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on trade receivables and
other financial assets, impairment losses on non-current assets and long-term incentive plan (LTIP);

     - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Reported EBITDA as adjusted for certain advertising costs,
monitoring fees, transactions costs, commission and activations fees, CPE installation related costs,
ADSL business and other sundry adjustments;

     - “Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the full period effect

The Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should
not be considered as alternatives to performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any
other generally accepted accounting principles. An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS
Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and
presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum
under “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data.”

The Non-IFRS Measures are not measures of financial performance recognized under IFRS and they should not
be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows,
the basis for dividend distribution or as measures of liquidity. Consequently, the methodology used for their
calculation may not be consistent with that adopted by other companies and, therefore, the Non-IFRS Measures
we present herein may not be comparable with those of others. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures
are that:

     - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or
contractual commitments;

     - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

     - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

     - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

     - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of
profit and loss and comprehensive income;

     - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

     - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

     - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet
our obligations or as measures of performance in order to assist in the analysis of our operating results,
profitability. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and
using these Non-IFRS Measures only as a supplement to evaluate our performance. Please see “Summary
_Historical and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial Statements_

**Overview**

We are the largest provider of broadband (“BB”) and ultra-broadband (“UBB”) fixed-wireless access (“FWA”)
services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the second largest based on
number of subscribers with a market share of 34.7% for year ended March 31, 2021. Our mission is to close the
digital and speed divide by offering high-speed broadband connectivity services in underserved rural (i.e., White
areas) and suburban areas (i.e., Grey II areas) in Italy where alternative connection technologies are either
unavailable or significantly delayed (i.e., FTTH) or have lower speed and quality performance (i.e., ADSL or
FTTC). As a result, we mainly focus on identified rural and suburban areas comprising approximately
11.5 million households in Italy where the penetration of broadband connection services is lower than in the rest
of Italy and where we offer the highest available speed (our “Target Addressable Market” or “TAM”). Our
unique FWA infrastructure platform enables us to offer in our Target Addressable Market, in a cost-effective
manner, speeds of up to 100 Mbps (download speed) and we are working to increase connection speeds to 300
Mbps in the near future to further distinguish our service offer. With selected business customers, we already
offer speeds of up 1 Gbps (download speed) through point-to-point (“PTP”) wireless link connections. In recent
years, we have aggressively expanded our FWA network coverage to reach more than 80% of households in our
Target Addressable Market and more than 6,700 municipalities across Italy’s 20 regions. This resulted in a strong
growth of our subscriber base from approximately 379,600 as of March 31, 2019 to 567,900 as of June 30, 2021,
with a CAGR of 19.6%. Our market share in our Target Addressable Market was 51.5% of FWA connections as
of March 31, 2021.

We own, lease and operate a unique proprietary end-to-end infrastructure network that enables us to offer a highquality service to our customers. Our FWA infrastructure covers the complete end-to-end core, distribution and
access networks of the fixed data transmission chain.

**EOLO’S END TO END INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK**

    - _Core Network. Our core network leverages on four core national points of presence (“POP”), five core_
regional POP and two data centers connected through our backbone. Our backbone is secured by longterm indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”) of third parties’ dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800
kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018);


1


-----

    - _Distribution Network. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. As of_
March 31, 2021, our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we
signed an agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 fiber-to-the-antenna links to base transceiver
stations (“BTS”) (i.e., fiber-to-the-antenna). As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600 radio
links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately +41% compared to March 31, 2018); and

    - _Access Network. As of August 31, 2021, our access network is based on approximately 3,400 BTS (an_
increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018), which deliver signal to the customer
premises equipment (the “CPE”), installed on customers’ premises, primarily using (i) the unlicensed
5GHz spectrum (for our 30 Mbps EOLO Wave offering) and (ii) the licensed 28 GHz spectrum (for our
advanced, higher speed 100 Mbps EOLO Wave G offering).

Our external network of approximately 1,500 technicians (known as “installers”) across Italy provides us with
in-depth local knowledge and a capillary presence in our Target Addressable Market, which in turn is
instrumental to our ability to offer high service levels.

As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network
that is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We offer our excess capacity on a wholesale basis to other
operators who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to acquire new customers or migrate customers currently served
through non-performing technologies in Italian rural and suburban areas. Building on this strategy, in 2020 we
signed an agreement with Wind 3 and in 2021 announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM; these
strategic partnership projects are focused on our Target Addressable Market, where TIM and Wind 3 will be able
to provide internet access services to their existing and new customers using our proprietary infrastructure
network.

We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth,
particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of coaxial cable infrastructure, delays in fiber
roll-out and difficult geographic terrain, only approximately 67% of Italian households as of December 31, 2019
had a fixed broadband connection as compared to a European average penetration rate of approximately 87% as
of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services, principally through FWA technology in rural and
suburban areas, are expected to continue to expand and close this penetration gap on the back of growing data
consumption driven by changing consumer habits (such as remote working) and the growing use of online
streaming, which trend has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We believe that there is an untapped growth opportunity in our Target Addressable Market, where broadband
penetration and high-speed connections are significantly lower than the national average level (penetration levels
between 56% and 60%). Given the physical geography and low population density of many Italian rural and
suburban communities, FWA can be the best technological alternative to deliver high broadband speeds at
competitive prices given its limited roll-out costs and fast network deployment times in these areas. Legacy
technologies (i.e., ADSL and FTTC) are proving less effective to meet the growing demand for bandwidth, while
FTTH is either not going to be deployed or will be deployed only with delays in these areas, in part due to the
significant investments required. As the largest provider of broadband and ultra-broadband services in our Target
Addressable Market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to exploit this growth opportunity.

The expansion of our FWA network and service offering in recent years has driven the growth of our total
revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. From the year ended March 31, 2019 our total revenues and
other income and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million, respectively, to
€198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a CAGR of 23.0%), respectively, for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021. For the same period, our loss for the year/period increased from €0.5 million to
€14.9 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 94% of our total revenues and other income was
generated from subscription-based revenues from monthly recurring debits by customers and approximately 6%
was generated from one-off payments, including activation fees and penalties for churned customers.

We divide our offering into the following three segments:

    - **Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 490,700 B2C**
subscribers (“B2C Subscribers”). Our offering to B2C Subscribers includes modular commercial
offerings designed to address different users’ needs with dedicated add-on packages: “Entertainment”
(streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and remote working applications) and “Security”
(antivirus and parental control).


2


-----

    - **Business-to-Business (“B2B”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 75,900 B2B subscribers**
(“B2B Subscribers”). Our offering to B2B Subscribers includes connectivity services for small and
home offices (“SoHo”) and small and medium enterprises (“Business”) to which we offer shared
solutions, and for large companies (“TOP”) to which we offer services through high-end connectivity
and dedicated infrastructure.

    - **FTTH. Although it does not represent our core business, we provide a FTTH service mainly in certain**
urban areas covered by Open Fiber’s FTTH infrastructure to complement our FWA services in order to
meet customer demand. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,400 fiber subscribers (“Fiber
**Subscribers”).**

As of June 30, 2021, our B2C and B2B Subscribers included approximately 48,500 wholesale end-customers
(“Wholesale Subscribers”). We sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through internet service providers (“ISP”),
system integrators and to national internet providers and international telecommunications providers to whom we
offer our excess capacity. We plan to strengthen our wholesale offering in the future relying more on major
national and international providers such as TIM and Wind 3 and further expand our wholesale offering to retail
customers.

The below charts set forth the percentage of our total revenues and other income and number of subscribers
represented by each of our three offering segments for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

**Number of Subscribers** **Revenues**


B2C B2B FTTH


B2C B2B FTTH One off Other income


One off: includes activation fees and penalties for churned customers (meaning such revenues are not generated from monthly subscription
debits);

Other income: includes, inter alia, grants from Infratel, out of period income, tax credit and hardware resale.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that a number of key factors gives us a competitive advantage, including:

**_We are the largest provider of FWA services by revenue in Italy with growing market share and innovative_**
**_FWA technology._**

We are the largest provider of BB and UBB FWA services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In terms of number of subscribers, we have a market share of 34.7% in Italy and we are the
undisputed leader with a market share of 51.5% in our Target Addressable Market. Our market share in the
broadband and FWA markets have grown faster in terms of new subscribers additions than the FWA market and
broadband market generally: our new subscriber additions grew at a CAGR of 24.9% from March 31, 2018 to
March 31, 2021, while the FWA market grew at a CAGR of 13.5% and the broadband market generally grew at a
CAGR of 3.0% during the same period.

Broadband FWA


We are the only player in Italy with a focus on FWA services in our Target Addressable Market. The other
principal player in Italy with a focus on FWA technology is Linkem. While Linkem has a larger number of
subscribers than EOLO, it is focused on prepaid solutions for urban and suburban areas and uses the 3.5 GHz
spectrum, which allows for less bandwidth (and therefore lower quality of service). Linkem’s growth in
subscribers was lower than EOLO’s (approximately 11% CAGR (December 2017-2020) compared to EOLO’s
24% (March 2018-2021). Other players in the FWA market include operators such as TIM and Vodafone, which
have “FWA-like” service offers based on their mobile infrastructure. While these “FWA-like” services will be
used in selected situations, these services are considered sub-optimal in comparison with FWA since they are
unable to match the data allowance offered by FWA and their implementation can present technical difficulties.

In the wholesale sector, we are the main player offering access to an FWA network in our Target Addressable
Market, which we believe will enable us to capture additional subscribers and therefore continue to grow our
subscriber base and market share in the medium term. As part of its plans to guarantee broadband deployment in
low population density areas with high investment costs, in accordance with the provisions of the EU broadband
State Aid guidelines implemented by the Italian government, Open Fiber is required to provide FWA active services
in White II Areas to third-party operators if no comparable access product is already offered in the same geographic
area by another operator. As EOLO already provides active services in such areas, Open Fiber will not be required
to offer active services in such areas. Even though Open Fiber might still decide to establish an FWA infrastructure
in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that our 80% coverage in our Target Addressable Market will act as
an economic disincentive for Open Fiber. This provides us with a pre-emptive opportunity in White II areas, thus
underpinning the uniqueness of our FWA infrastructure and the leadership position in our Target Addressable
Market.

Our leading market position in our Target Addressable Market is underpinned by the superior performance of our
FWA service offering in such areas as compared to other available fixed BB and UBB technologies. In our
Target Addressable Market, FTTH technology is either largely unavailable or expected to be deployed with
delays while other available technologies, such as ADSL and FTTC, do not offer the same speed and overall
performance levels. Our unique FWA network enables us to currently offer the highest available speed in our
Target Addressable Market with download/upload speeds of up to 100/20 Mbps and up to 1Gbps for selected
business clients and we have an established roadmap to roll out services with a download speed of up to 300
Mbps in the near future. In addition, our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class intervention
services, low time to market and effective maintenance and repair services.

Our leading market position is further supported by our technological knowhow, which has enabled us to develop
unique, proprietary and data-driven technologies to support our functions. These custom solutions include:

    - EOLIA is our self-designed software for network design, operations, management and monitoring,
which plays a critical role for our network planning and installation approach and which has
contributed to our successful network expansion and customer satisfaction. We use EOLIA to identify
the overall network topology, health status for wireless access and wireless backhaul network, wireless
backhauling link occupation and historical data and trends;

    - G-EOLO is our location intelligence system which uses internal information and external sources to
identify potentially attractive market areas for our network expansion;


4


-----

    - Blue system is our patented traffic re-balancing platform. As part of our Blue system, we have also
developed Otelma, our in-house built software, which continuously applies traffic steering policy
avoiding backhauling congestion; and

    - Datawave is our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and warehouse
management. The main functions covered by Datawave relate to the automated processes of the
operational activities carried out by our installers. For example, Datawave help us assign the work
orders to our installers and exchanges information with EOLIA about the field activities aimed at the
installation of new BTSs.

Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’
architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result
of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. On-field feedback is key
to improve our performances. For example, we have managers focusing on specific areas of the Italian territory
(i.e., North West, North East, Center and South of Italy). Our area managers, inter alia, update our internal
database in case of poor coverage in certain areas and/or competitors’ presence. We also work with two primary
radio access equipment manufacturers in the design and development of point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) and PTP
connections: Cambium Networks Ltd. and Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions. Over the last few years, we have
leveraged our strong relationships with our suppliers to develop multiple access technologies to achieve optimal
coverage and network performance.

We believe that our superior service offering and technological leadership provide us with a clear competitive
advantage resulting in high customer satisfaction rates (more than 85% for the month ended April 31, 2021,
based on the number of customers declaring themselves “very satisfied” after interactions with our technicians)
and in our leading and growing market share. We also believe our leading market position places us well to meet
the growing demand for high-speed connectivity services in our Target Addressable Market.

**_Fast-growing Italian broadband market with a large untapped opportunity for FWA service providers in our_**
**_Target Addressable Market._**

We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth,
particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and
difficult morphology, only approximately 67% of Italian households have a broadband connection versus a
European average penetration of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019.

Broadband connection services are expected to grow and close this gap on the back of growing data consumption
as evidenced by the 25.6% average annual growth rate of fixed line data consumption from the year ended
December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2020 and the 35.7% average annual growth in mobile data
traffic from 2017 to 2020 due to changes in consumer behavior and the availability of increased speeds. The main
drivers of data traffic growth include trends such as the growing use of streaming platforms, online shopping,
online banking applications, video-on-demand as well as gaming and video activities. The growing adoption of
these new applications was boosted by social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns
and the ensuing changes in work and life habits (e.g., remote working, home schooling, and greater adoption of
virtual social interactions). On the back of these long-term trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to
continue growing for the period from 2021 to 2024, driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage.

In our Target Addressable Market, we see a large untapped opportunity for our services. The penetration of
broadband services in these areas is lower than at national level with penetration levels between 56% and 60% as
compared to a national average of 67% as of December 31, 2019. The low internet penetration is primarily due to
the fact that these areas are serviced mainly through legacy ADSL and FTTC connections which have proven to
be ineffective in delivering high-speed connections in areas with challenging geography and low population
density. For example, ADSL connections offer maximum speeds of up to 30 Mbps. FTTC connections, on the
other hand, offer speeds of up to 100 Mbps, but only if the customer premise is close to the fiber cabinet. FTTC
connection speeds reduce to 30 Mbps for distances from the cabinet of up to 1 kilometer. This distance tends to
increase as the service area becomes more rural (i.e., less home density). There is also a wide variation in the
distribution of the secondary copper length in suburban and rural areas, which leads to inconsistent performance.

The graphics below show the breakdown of BB connections by download speed available from all providers in
our Target Addressable Market for the year ended March 31, 2020.

We also believe that the plans by fiber providers such as Open Fiber and FiberCop to increase fiber coverage
throughout Italy will have only a limited impact on our competitive position in our Target Addressable Market.
While FTTH technology can deliver connection speeds of up to 1 Gbps, it is a suboptimal technology for rural
and suburban areas for several reasons. First, FTTH has high installation and deployment costs, making it a
viable technology primarily in densely populated areas. For instance, the average FTTH development capital
expenditures per household connected in rural areas is estimated to be more than double the capital expenditures
required for FWA, resulting in significantly longer payback periods.

(1) total deployment capital expenditures (excluding grants).

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router).

In addition, FTTH has experienced long installation periods in rural areas, making it a less appealing technology
as compared to FWA. In the few White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is a significant
time gap between completion of the network and availability for use by broadband operators due to lack of last
meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates a
time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to
connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be
exploited by FWA operators. Finally, Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans have experienced several delays as
compared to their original schedule, with only 22.6% of targeted municipalities in White I Areas tested as of
August 2021.

As a result, FTTH is not expected to be deployed to the Grey II and White II areas of our Target Addressable
Market, which represent 6.9 million households (or 29% of total Italian households) or will be deployed on a
delayed basis compared to Open Fiber’s original plans for White I areas, representing an additional 4.0 million
households (15% of total). Accordingly, FWA can be seen as the best technological alternative to FTTH in our
Target Addressable Market on account of FWA’s generally competitive broadband speeds, lower roll-out cost
and more rapid speed of network deployment as compared to FTTH.

In addition, we believe that 5G mobile technology does not represent a viable alternative to FWA service in our
Target Addressable Market. First, 5G mobile technology is designed to offer connectivity in a mobile context,
rather than to be a fixed broadband service. In addition, the substantial upfront investment needed to deploy 5G
infrastructure in low-density rural and suburban areas in Italy (such as our Target Addressable Market), including
the cost of towers and other assets, are unlikely to generate an attractive return on investment for 5G operators.
Mobile operators offering “FWA-like” solutions are also not expected to present a meaningful competitive threat
to EOLO, as their solutions are based on mobile technology which may face congestion issues (as the same
spectrum is used for mobile and fixed users, which typically leads to data caps). In contrast, EOLO utilizes a
different network architecture with fixed line-of-sight from the antennas to the houses, ensuring a fixed
bandwidth for each household.

These considerations explain why the number of FWA connections in Italy has doubled over the last five years
from 0.74 million in 2015 to 1.37 million in September 2020 to 1.54 million in December 2020, resulting in an
increase in FWA’s penetration of the Italian broadband market from 5% to 9% of all broadband technologies.
Due to its geographical characteristics and large number of small municipalities (i.e., municipalities with less
than 5,000 inhabitants), Italy is by far the European country with the highest number of FWA connections and
the highest FWA proportion of fixed BB lines.

We believe there is a large, untapped opportunity for our services in our Target Addressable Market due to
FWA’s ability to effectively meet the growing data consumption demand in our Total Addressable Market and
the expectation that fiber coverage will not reach areas in our Target Addressable Market representing 29% of
Italian households or will reach areas representing 15% of Italian households only with delay. We believe that
FWA will continue to gain market share in our Total Addressable Market and in what we view as our core target
addressable market of approximately 7.5 million households in Grey II and White II areas (our “Core Target
**Addressable Market”) and triple the number of connections between 2021 and 2036.**

**_Unique proprietary infrastructure network that provides high barriers to entry._**

We own, lease and operate a unique proprietary end-to-end infrastructure network that enables us to offer a highquality service to our customers. We are the only end-to-end FWA infrastructure network covering more than
80% of households in our Target Addressable Market and we expect that our coverage will increase following
the anticipated completion of the FWA network in the near future. Our FWA infrastructure covers the complete


8


-----

end-to-end core, distribution and access networks of the fixed data transmission chain. Our core network
leverages four core national POP, five core regional POP and two data centers (main center and disaster recovery
center). Three of our core national POP are deployed in the Milan area, and the fourth in the Rome area, and they
are connected with over-the-top (“OTT”) providers and internet. We have regional POP collecting local traffic in
high-penetration areas in Bologna, Verona, Turin and Pisa (and the POP in Naples will be deployed in early
2022). Our POP and data centers are connected through our backbone, which is secured by long-term IRU on
third parties dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800 kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of
more than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018). Our long-term IRU have average residual durations of
15-18 years as of May 2021. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. As of
March 31, 2021, our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we signed an
agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 FTTA links. As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600
radio links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately +41% compared to March 31, 2018). Our access
network connects our customers to the network through a system of owned BTS (approximately 3,400) which are
installed on third-party transmission towers, and CPEs, which are installed on customers’ premises but owned by
us.

Our BTS and CPEs communicate using the following spectrum: the licensed 28 GHz spectrum (through our
EOLO Wave G technology, which is able to offer internet speed up to 100 Mbps with PMP wireless connection
and up to 1 Gbps for selected business customers with a PTP wireless connection), the unlicensed 5 GHz
spectrum (though our EOLO Wave technology, which is able to offer internet speed up to 30 Mbps) and, only in
the region of Val d’Aosta, the licensed 3.5 GHz spectrum (using our EOLO Wave technology). As of June 30,
2021, we have in Italy (i) the largest spectrum ownership of 28 GHz spectrum alongside TIM and (ii) the second
largest spectrum ownership across millimeter wavers and second only to TIM, leveraging the 26 GHz spectrum
and the 28 GHz spectrum.

Our infrastructure mainly leverages third party towers through rental agreements. We rent more than 3,000
towers (where our BTS are installed) approximately 50% of which are from independent owners and local
entities, which we believe enables us to obtain generally favorable leasing terms. The vast majority of our towerrental agreements are long-term with a residual life of 14 years and provide for a tacit renewal. The remaining
towers are either secured under IRU contracts or owned and built on land where we own surface rights.

Our infrastructure network comprises modern and state-of-the art equipment. Over the last three years to
March 31, 2021, we invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. During this period, our network coverage has expanded from
5,900 municipalities in 2018 to 6,300 municipalities in 2021, from 66% to approximately 80% of households in
our Target Addressable Market and from 0.5% in 2018 to 34.6% in 2021 of our Target Addressable Market in the
South of Italy and Italian islands. The number of BTS reached approximately 3,400 on August 31, 2021 (an
increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018). Between 2019 and 2021, we increased the
internet access capacity of our network from 720 Gbps to 2,250 Gbps, with the large part of this increase
achieved during 2020 in order to cope with the increase in data traffic and internet usage during the COVID 19
pandemic. As a result, our network today has sufficient capacity to support our expectations of an exponential
growth in data consumption.

We believe our largely proprietary infrastructure network is unique and provides us with a number of competitive
advantages. It is the only FWA infrastructure network in Italy already deployed and that guarantees an 80%
coverage of our Target Addressable Market, which provides us with a clear “first mover advantage”. Our
network is an end-to-end network built on largely proprietary infrastructure or operated under long-term
contracts. Our backbone and distribution networks are secured through long-term quasi ownership contracts with
leading providers. The network is resilient, has ample spare capacity and ensures best in class performance even
at traffic peaks. We have a diverse high-frequency spectrum ownership, representing the second largest spectrum
ownership in Italy across millimeter wavers and second only to TIM, leveraging the 26 GHz spectrum and the 28
GHz spectrum. Finally, our network enables us to offer market leading speeds of 100 Mbps and, for selected
business customers, up to 1 Gbps.

Our infrastructure network represents a significant barrier to entry in our Target Addressable Market given the
large investments required to build the network and the economic disadvantages that would result from an
overbuild in the same areas, such as such as the risk of lower penetration and inability to reach the optimal
saturation levels for each installed BTS. By offering our excess capacity in our Target Addressable Market to
other telecommunications operators under wholesale arrangements, we retain our infrastructure leadership while
discouraging competitors from deploying their own FWA network; instead the operators rely on our state-ofthe-art infrastructure. In addition, the provision of a 28 GHz offering requires significant technical capabilities
and capital investments as well as spectrum licenses that are not easily obtainable for operators lacking
familiarity with the spectrum license tender process. We believe our business is protected also by our capillary
local presence, technological know-how and proprietary network planning software and capabilities.

**_Superior utility-like offering resulting in high customer satisfaction, low churn rates and high proportion of_**
**_subscription-based revenues._**

We have a superior utility-like service offering that is underpinned by a high proportion of subscription-based
revenues from recurring monthly debits by customers, market leading low churn rates and high customer
satisfaction levels.

Our revenues generated by monthly subscription contracts represented 94%, 94% and 93% of our total revenues
and other income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the year ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended
March 31 2020, respectively.

Our B2C offering includes a monthly subscription-based solution (i.e., EOLO più) and a prepaid solution (i.e.,
_EOLO Quando Vuoi). Our monthly subscription-based solution, currently at €24.90 per month, includes_
unlimited voice, and can be bundled with three additional packages that enable better connections or quality of

service based on customer needs (“Entertainment” (streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and
remote working applications) and “Security” (antivirus and parental control)), which increases the monthly price
to up to €36.90. Approximately 76% of our B2C Subscribers using our monthly subscription solution chooses at
least one additional service as of March 31, 2021. Our revenues generated through sales to B2C Subscribers are
mostly entirely derived from subscription based solutions (99%, 99% and 100% in the years ended March 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Only 1% of our revenues generated by sales to B2C Subscribers derive from
sales to pre-paid customers that typically use our services on a seasonal basis (such as during vacation periods),
which further illustrates the stable nature of our customer base and revenues.

Our high-quality service is reflected by market leading low churn rates and stable Blended ARPU over time. For
the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our Blended Churn Rate was 11.8%, 10.8% and 12.5%,
respectively. These levels compare with average churn rates for the Italian broadband market over such periods
of 26.3%, 22.7% and 24.2% respectively. Our average Blended Churn Rate 2019-2021 of 11.7% is in line with
the churn rate for FTTH (10% average for the years 2016 to 2019) and considerably lower than churn rates for
other fixed broadband technologies, such as FTTC (22% average for the years 2016 to 2019) and ADSL (40%
average for the years 2016 to 2019). In the year ended March 31, 2021, we experienced a slight increase in churn
rates due to the COVID-19 lock downs, which led to higher network saturation and increases of technical issues.
In general, however, the low levels of our Blended Churn Rates reflect the loyalty of our customer base and its
high satisfaction levels.

Our Blended ARPU has been stable over the past three years, amounting to €29.9, €29.8, €29.5 and €29.4 per
month in the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021,
respectively.

In addition, our customer service is supported by our capillary-like presence in our Target Addressable Market
through our FWA network itself, which due to our network of professionals and system integrators located in the
different regions, has resulted in a strong territorial presence that has allowed us take advantage of the deep
territorial knowledge gained through the years, in morphological (i.e., geographic features, building and
population density) and technical terms. This is supported by a wide network of 1,500 installers who have a
broad and deep knowledge of their local market characteristics, customer base and competitor behavior. This
capillary-like presence has been developed over the years through our experience and research and development
investments. We use our proprietary software, including G-EOLO (our location intelligence system) and
Datawave (our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and warehouse
management) to support our local presence. Our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class
intervention services and low time to market reflected by our average time to market of 10-14 days (from order
to activation). In addition, our trained installer base offers an effective maintenance and repair service and
enables us to effectively capture cross-selling opportunities. We believe that this bespoke approach distinguishes

our offer from that of the large FTTH/FTTC groups and other Italian FWA operators that do not have this deep
presence in, or our demonstrated commitment to, our Target Addressable Market.

Our high Net Promoter Score at national level (“NPS”) (as of November 2020) reflects our high customer
satisfaction, ranking EOLO as the second best-in-class after the national FTTH leader Fastweb.

**_Strong financial performance with high profit margins and large proportion of success-based capital_**
**_expenditures resulting in attractive cash flow dynamics._**

We have a demonstrated a strong financial performance with a high growth in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
In addition, our high profit margins, high proportion of success-based growth capital expenditures and
structurally negative working capital provide us with attractive cash flow dynamics and a high degree of control
over our cash flow generation.

As compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, our total revenues and other income, and Adjusted EBITDA
increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million to €198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a
CAGR of 23.0%) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Over the same period, our loss for the year/period
increased from €0.5 million to €14.9 million. The increase in total revenues and other income and Adjusted
EBITDA was driven by a significant growth in our subscriber base at a CAGR of 19.6% from March 31, 2019 to
June 30, 2021 and a stable Blended ARPU. Over this period, our Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from
52.2% to 54.4% driven by our strong revenue growth and economies of scale deriving from our network
scalability. We expect our Adjusted EBITDA margin to improve as we continue to grow our network coverage
and customer base. We should also benefit from decreasing subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”) (as a proportion
of revenues) as our growth rates normalize. Additionally, we expect that by selling excess capacity to other
operators and growing our Wholesale business, we can increase the utilization of our asset base and benefit from
operating synergies.

We achieved strong financial performance during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the growth of our B2C and
B2B customer base resulting in an overall 19.6% growth in our subscribers between March 31, 2020 and
March 31, 2021, and benefited from the increased, accelerated investments that we made at the start of the
pandemic in order to adapt our network capacity to a growing demand for broadband capacity and services,
particularly in fiber backhauling and the rollout of our 28 GHz service.

We have invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment during the three year period. Our Adjusted Capital Expenditures
have grown at a CAGR of 17.9% from 2019 to 2021 to sustain an increased geographic coverage, a larger
customer base and an increase of our network capacity to support the growing data traffic during the pandemic.


12


-----

We have made significant investments to support growth, mainly for CPE, including the higher cost 28 GHz
CPEs, and BTS/backhauling infrastructure. Investments in CPEs (including installation) and BTS represent the
large majority of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures, equal to 83.7%, 83.0% and 79.7% of the total for the years
ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
approximately 63.0%, 64.3% and 62.4%, respectively of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures are growth-related
with the balance related to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base (e.g., maintenance,
network upgrading and subscriber base upselling toward 28GHz spectrum). Of our Growth Adjusted Capital
Expenditures, the majority relates to CPE and are therefore success-based. CPEs is installed only after the
execution of a new contract with the client and if the client decides to terminate the contract, we charge a penalty
to retrieve CPEs from a customer’s premises. The remaining Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures relate to
increases in data capacity and BTS investments, which are determined by our data driven technologically
advanced network development applications, which have proven successful so far in identifying new areas of
profitable growth. For these reasons, we believe that a large proportion of our Growth Adjusted Capital
Expenditures are low risk, success based and closely related to the growth in our customer base.

We also believe we can exert a good degree of control over our cashflow generation capability. Expenditures
related to the purchase of CPEs and BTS represent the largest portion of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures. We
enter into arrangements with suppliers that include purchase commitments of up to one year; however, our
arrangement with Cambium, our current major supplier of CPEs, includes purchase commitments of up to three
months. As a result, we have low proportion of committed capital expenditures. In addition, a significant
component of our costs are marketing and sales costs, which are mainly variable as they relate to new subscriber
acquisition and therefore they increase in absolute value alongside customer base. The short commitment period
of our largest capital expenditure items and the significant proportion of operating costs directly linked to new
customer acquisitions provide us with additional cashflow flexibility in periods of low market growth or periods
of reduced investments in network growth. Our cashflow generation is also supported by a structurally negative
working capital as retail customers are billed in advance on a bi-monthly basis.

Our business has a demonstrated ability to generate robust cashflows pre-growth capital expenditure. Over the
last three years, our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) amounted to €28.6 million in 2019,
€43.8 million in 2020 and €57.5 million in 2021, resulting in robust Cash Conversion of 42.2% in 2019, 50.0% in
2020 and 53.4% in 2021. We have historically reinvested these cashflows in our business to sustain our increased
geographic coverage and network expansion. For the same periods, our net cash flows generated by operating
activities was €56.8 million, €83.3 million and €91.6 million, respectively.

We plan to continue to invest in growth capital expenditures to expand our network coverage and subscriber base
and exploit the substantial growth opportunity presented by our Target Addressable Market, which we expect
will continue to generate a profitable revenue growth deriving from our operating leverage and scalable business
model. We intend to continue to use our internal cashflow generation to finance our growth together with the
additional liquidity raised through the Transactions and to pursue a prudent financial policy carefully monitoring
our financial leverage and maintaining sufficient liquidity sources. We expect that our high profit margins, low
maintenance capital expenditures, high proportion of success-based growth capital expenditures, low committed
capital expenditures and structurally negative working capital will continue to provide us with attractive cashflow
dynamics and a high degree of control over our cashflow generation.

**_Highly committed Sponsor investing in unique infrastructure network and strongly experienced management_**
**_team with clear industry vision._**

We are supported by our highly committed sponsor, Partners Group, and our founder and Chief Executive
Officer and senior executive team. As part of the Acquisition, funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group
and our founder are contributing €910.1 million of new equity (consisting of equity and subordinated shareholder
loan) funds and rollover equity funding (consisting of equity and subordinated shareholder loan) to the Group,
representing approximately 70% of our capitalization as adjusted for the Acquisition. We believe this investment
reflects our shareholders’ commitment to the business.

Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Luca Spada, founded the business in 1999, and has guided us through
our development and growth over the last twenty years with his clear industry vision and emphasis on developing
proprietary solutions to the challenges faced in offering state-of-the-art FWA services to the underserved
suburban and rural areas of Italy, thus closing the digital and speed divide for these areas. Luca Spada will
indirectly re-invest in EOLO through his vehicle Cometa, retaining a 25% ownership and will continue to act as
CEO and a member of our board of directors.

The eight members of our senior executive team have over 170 years of combined telecommunications and
technology experience gained at leading participants in the sector, including Vodafone, Open Fiber, TIM, BT,
Sky, Fastweb, Metroweb and Iliad. Our management has a strong track record of delivering strong organic
growth and successfully completing large capital expenditures investment plans.

Moreover, following the Acquisition, we expect to benefit from the market expertise, business relationships,
knowledge and experience of Partners Group, which is a global private markets investment management firm.
The acquisition of EOLO is financed with dedicated infrastructure capital. In private infrastructure, Partners
Group manages assets of USD 16 billion and has on behalf of its clients directly invested in more than 140
businesses and assets since inception. The investment focus in private infrastructure is on companies and assets
that combine recurring cash flows with value creation opportunities. We expect therefore to benefit from Partners
Group track record and expertise in the infrastructure sector, including in particular the telecommunications
sector.

**Our Strategies**

We intend to grow our business and maintain our market leadership by implementing the following strategies:

**_Continue the technological upgrade of our FWA network to offer higher connection speeds and improved_**
**_quality of service._**

Our technological know-how represents an important driver of our success and a distinct competitive advantage.
Our proprietary data-driven network planning and cost-conscious approach to new installations have historically
yielded successful network expansion, generated high customer satisfaction levels and supported our profitable
growth. We intend to continue the technological upgrade of our infrastructure network to offer high connection
speeds and improved service quality, to upsell our service offering to our existing customer base and to manage
our churn rate. Our network upgrade is based on three key pillars:

    - _Migration from EOLO Wave to EOLO Wave G. EOLO Wave is the FWA broadband service which_
leverages the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum (or 3.5 GHz in Valle d’Aosta) and offers a maximum
download speed of 30 Mbps. EOLO Wave G is the ultra-broadband FWA service using the 28 GHz
licensed spectrum and offers a maximum speed of 100 Mbps and up to 1 Gbps for selected B2B
customers (i.e., customers who have a PTP connection). As of June 30, 2021, approximately 76% and
23% of our customers relied on EOLO Wave and EOLO Wave G, respectively, for their connectivity.
In recent years, we have started to increase our 28 GHz presence and migrate subscribers from 5 GHz
to 28 GHz plans. The historical churn rate is higher on 5 GHz products as compared to 28 GHz
products as 28 GHz products have higher performance. As a result, one of the tools that we have to
proactively prevent churn is to offer upgrades to customers who may be served by BTS that are overutilized in the 5 GHz bandwidth. As we increase our 28 GHz presence, we intend to follow our
roadmap to attain download speeds of up to 300 Mbps in the near future and provide this solution to all
of our customers relying on EOLO Wave G for their connectivity.

    - _Expansion of our fiber backhauling. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio_
links. Our fiber backhauling provides direct fiber connections which bring higher capacity and
availability as compared to our radio links. Our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits.
As part of our strategy to expand our fiber backhauling and therefore improve our network reliability
and efficiency, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open Fiber which secured us access to an
additional 1,000 FTTA links.

    - _Continuous development of our proprietary software and applications. We continue to make_
investments to drive the development of our own digital infrastructure in order to improve reliability,
coverage and speed. Our research and development efforts in recent years have included, and will
continue to include, two main projects: 5G NR (New Radio) and traffic optimization. 5G NR is a new
radio access technology developed for 5G mobile networks. It is designed to be the global standard for
the air interface of 5G networks. In recent years, we have been working with our suppliers to develop a
5G NR standard compatible solution able to support FWA technology services. In our second main
project, since 2014 we have developed our own BTS router with the goal of optimizing network traffic.
We have also developed Otelma, our in-house designed software, which continuously applies traffic
steering policies to avoid backhauling congestion. Our goal is to leverage our research and


14


-----

development outputs and roll them out across our network to support the reliability, redundancy and
efficiency of the services we provide.

**_Accelerate network expansion to cover underserved White and Grey Areas in our Target Addressable Market_**
**_to acquire new customers._**

We intend to accelerate the nationwide expansion of our FWA infrastructure network, particularly in the South of
Italy where we have less of a presence. Our FWA network presently covers approximately 80% of households in
our Target Addressable Market and we expect this coverage to increase significantly following expansion of our
fiber backhauling, the deployment of new 28 GHz BTS and the upgrade of existing BTS. We plan to continue to
manage carefully our FWA network expansion and maximize our network efficiency leveraging the following:

    - _Our network planning tools. We will continue to use our proprietary, data-driven network planning and_
installation tools and applications, such as EOLIA and G-EOLO. Using these tools, we carry out
in-depth analyses using multiple criteria to assess potential new development areas, including: the
coverage request coming from a certain area, the market potential, socio-demographic characteristics
and the competitor presence. This process allows us to assess a suitability score to each area and to
highlight the most profitable areas for our coverage expansion. After the area has been identified, we
conduct the on-site survey to choose the optimum tower sites and finalize the technical configuration.
The process ends with the devices being activated and configured by EOLIA. By using this process and
our proprietary software application EOLIA, we have been able to optimize our selection process for
new installations and achieve attractive payback periods for our investments in network expansion.

    - _Deep territorial knowledge. Our installers represent a unique asset and are critical to our success. We_
have been supporting the creation of our community of installers providing continuous training,
assistance, supporting tools and applications and engagement activities. Installers are selected based on
their connections with the territory and their experience and we believe this will help us acquire
customers in underserved areas and build our new customers’ loyalty, as installers represent a trusted
point of reference for customers.

The large majority of the investments that we have made over the past three years to expand our FWA network
included investments in CPE (including installation) and BTS (equal to 83.7%, 83.0% and 79.7% of our Adjusted
Capital Expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively). For the years ended
March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, approximately 63.0%, 64.3% and 62.4%, respectively, of our Adjusted Capital
Expenditure are growth-related with the balance related to investments aimed at preserving our current customer
base (e.g., maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling to 28 GHz spectrum solutions). Of our
Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures, the majority relates to CPE and is therefore success-based. Our
remaining Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures relate to increases in data capacity and BTS investments,
which are driven by our data driven technologically-advanced network development applications, which have
proven successful so far in identifying new areas of profitable growth. For these reasons, we believe that a large
proportion of our Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures are low risk, success based and closely related to the
growth of our customer base. We intend to continue to be disciplined in our selection process of new areas of
profitable growth.

We believe that we are well-positioned to expand our subscriber base in Grey II and White areas for the reasons
outlined in the table below.

|BB Areas|EOLO’s strategy|
|---|---|
|Grey II|• Target an underpenetrated market of 4.6 million households with better technology (FWA) than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where FTTH coverage is not expected. • The Government is concentrated on bridging the digital divide and therefore we expect that future government tenders will be focused on areas where EOLO is not already present. • The Government may offer public subsidies to private operators in underserved areas where none are currently present or plan to expand into; this may offer upside potential related to areas currently not included in EOLO’s network coverage plan that has been shared with the Government.|


15


-----

|BB Areas|EOLO’s strategy|
|---|---|
|White I|• Target an underpenetrated market of 4.0 million households currently served with low-speed broadband and where FWA is the best technological alternative to FTTH. • FWA and FTTH can co-exist in White I areas for the long term and jointly address the digital divide. FTTH is not expected to be rolled out in 100% of White I households due to high technical KO rates and expensive last mile connection. • Open Fiber’s delay in network roll-out opens a window of opportunity for EOLO to capture subscribers first and then prevent these subscribers from changing to other operators when EOLO is rolled out by offering speeds that would be sufficient for most consumers. EOLO will also be able to re-sell Open Fiber’s open-access FTTH to its customers as a churn mitigation tactic.|
|White II|• Target underpenetrated market of 2.9 million households with better technology (FWA) than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where no FTTH coverage is currently foreseen. • Pre-empt Open Fiber’s FWA network roll-out by rolling out its own network first. Considering the delay in Open Fiber’s roll-out plan (only 3.6% of FWA network has been completed as of August 2021), and EOLO’s territorial and technological knowledge, we believe EOLO has a strong competitive edge. As of February 2021, Open Fiber received 321 FWA orders (81% KO rate compared to 25% KO EOLO’s rate).|


**_Continue expansion of our wholesale footprint._**

As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network
which is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We currently offer and expect to continue to offer our
excess capacity to other national operators that can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to either sell solutions to new
customers who are located in areas where such operators do not have a network infrastructure or migrate
customers currently served through underperforming technologies in our Target Addressable Market. In addition,
we plan to expand our wholesale channel by selling our solutions to independent and local ISP who are not able
to sustain the network investments required to update their wireless networks with the latest technologies or to
adapt their capacity to the increased traffic.

We intend to aggressively expand our wholesale offering as we see a number of benefits that we can achieve
from doing so. Offering our excess capacity to other operators will reduce our subscriber acquisition costs,
thereby helping to de-risk the commercial strategy of our core B2C and B2B businesses and discourage
competitors from deploying their own FWA network, and instead having competitors rely on our state-of-the-art
infrastructure. The resulting growth in the subscriber base should enable us to improve our network efficiency by
utilizing available capacity with no impact on the connection quality for our customers. In addition, we believe
that expanding our wholesale offering in areas where we are the sole provider of FWA services will help manage
our churn rate as customers switching among operators hosted on our network will nevertheless continue to use
our infrastructure. Additionally, we expect that by selling excess capacity to other operators and growing our
wholesale business, we maximize the utilization of our asset base further benefitting from operating synergies.

Prior to 2021, our wholesale distribution was limited only to B2B customers through the agreement signed with
Wind 3 and other operators. Following the recently announced memorandum of understanding with TIM, we
intend to expand our wholesale distribution to B2C customers. We intend to sell to our Wholesale Subscribers
through other ISPs, system integrators and national (e.g., Retelit, Fastweb and Vianova) and international (e.g.,
Sparkle, NTT, Telefònica, Verizon, BT and AT&T) internet providers. We expect that our wholesale strategy
will be a key driver of our future growth in subscribers and market share.

**_Capitalize on attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities._**

We will continue to evaluate additional organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the FWA market in Italy
and outside Italy over the medium term to long term.

In particular, we may consider options with respect to launching our own mobile offering in order to further
enhance our existing customer proposition by cross-selling mobile services, thus encouraging our customers to
subscribe to both fixed-line and mobile services, which we expect will result in a reduction of customer churn
rate. We intend to apply a strategic cost-benefit analysis to evaluate potential targets and growth opportunities
and only pursue such growth opportunities that are accretive to cash flow generation.


16


-----

In addition, we may selectively consider opportunities for consolidation in the fragmented FWA market in Italy,
which includes a number small local FWA operators.

In the longer term, we will explore the potential exporting of our FWA business model to other appropriate
European markets that have market characteristics and competitive dynamics that are similar to those of the
Italian market.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On July 17, 2021, the Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Sellers to acquire the entire issued
and outstanding share capital of the Target.

At signature of the Acquisition Agreement, the consummation of the Acquisition was subject to the satisfaction
of two conditions precedent: (i) obtaining a decision, in whatever form (including a declaration of lack of
jurisdiction) by the MED, concerning the transfer of the radiofrequency rights of use and/or the change of control
and/or the relevant authorizations pursuant to the provisions set forth by the applicable law governing the
electronic communications sector and (ii) obtaining the authorization of the Acquisition by the presidency of the
Italian Council of Ministries (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) under Law 56 of May 11, 2012, and the
relevant implementing decrees adopted by the Italian government and the President of the Italian Republic, and
under Law No. 133 of November 18, 2019, all as subsequently amended and supplemented (the “Italian Golden
**Power Legislation”).**

On September 2, 2021, we obtained the authorization by the Italian Counsel of Ministries concerning Italian
Golden Power Legislation and on September 24, 2021 we obtained the authorization by the MED concerning the
transfer of the radiofrequency rights of use and/or the change of control and/or the relevant authorizations.
Therefore, we expect that the Acquisition Closing Date will occur by the end of October 2021. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control_
_the Target until completion of the Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.”_

Consideration for the Acquisition will consist of a base price of €1,125.0 million. In addition, the purchase price
will be reduced by the amount of leakages, being actions undertaken after March 31, 2021 and resulting in the
loss of cash or other value from the Target in favor of the relevant selling shareholder(s) or their related parties,
such as the payment of any dividends, any other payments or disposals, assignments or transfer of assets or any
payments made pursuant to any guarantee, indemnity or similar obligation, among other things, in each case to
the extent not expressly permitted by the Acquisition Agreement (collectively, the “Leakages”). As part of the
Transactions and concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, Cometa will indirectly reinvest into the
Target through the subscription and payment of an equity stake in HoldCo representing 25% of the share capital
of HoldCo. See “—Sources and Uses” and “Use of Proceeds.”

The Acquisition Agreement contains customary warranties and indemnities given by the Sellers as to capacity
and title as well as customary covenants given by the Sellers regarding, among other things, the conduct of the
business and the affairs of the Target pending closing of the Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a
warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations.

Although the Sellers have given certain customary representations, warranties and indemnities in the Acquisition
Agreement, the Issuer may not be able to enforce claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these
representations, warranties and indemnities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not
_be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the Sellers have_
_provided to the Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement.”_

As part of the Acquisition and in accordance with the provisions included in the Shareholder Agreement (as
defined herein), the Sponsor expects to allocate certain equity instruments of HoldCo to certain current and
future members of our senior management team through an incentive plan to be implemented on or as soon as
practicable following completion of the Acquisition. See “Principal Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships
_and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan.”_

**_The Financing_**

The Transactions are expected to require a total of €1,299.8 million in a combination of debt and equity financing
and cash available on the Target’s balance sheet. The Transactions will be financed with (i) proceeds from the


17


-----

Offering in an aggregate principal amount of €375.0 million and (ii) €910.1 million of shareholder funding in the
form of (a) an equity contribution to be provided by HoldCo to the Issuer (in the amount of €182.0 million) and
(b) a deeply subordinated shareholder loan by HoldCo to the Issuer for an amount of €728.1 million, (together,
“Shareholder Funding”) and (iii) €14.7 million of available cash on the Target’s balance sheet. We refer to the
Offering and the Shareholder Funding (and the use of available cash), together, as the “Financing.”

The proceeds from the Financing will be used by the Issuer to:

    - fund the Funding Loan by using an estimated €146.1 million representing all the proceeds from
Tranche B (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under the Notes;

    - fund the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement by using (x) proceeds from the
Shareholder Funding, and (y) an estimated €214.9 million representing all the proceeds from Tranche
A (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under the Notes; and

    - pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, including estimated fees and
expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering, by using an estimated €14.0 million
representing all the proceeds from Tranche C (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under
the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions of
the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to, on the one hand, consummate the Acquisition and, on
the other hand, make the Funding Loan for purposes of, inter alia, the Refinancing, and will not entail issuing
separate identifiers (ISINs or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the Notes. See “Use of
_proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of the Notes.”_

On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, pursuant to
which the Revolving Credit Facility will be made available for drawings in the amount of up to €125.0 million,
which we currently expect to be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

**_The Refinancing_**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use the proceeds from Tranche B (as defined under “Use of
_Proceeds”) under the Notes to fund the Funding Loan, a portion of which will be used by the Target to repay or_
otherwise refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness (the “Refinancing”). As of June 30, 2021, the principal
amount of the Refinanced Target Indebtedness amounted to €119.9 million, excluding accrued and unpaid
interest of €0.6 million as of June 30, 2021. The principal amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness as well as
the amount of accrued and unpaid interest outstanding and payable on the Acquisition Closing Date may vary
from the amounts outstanding and due on June 30, 2021. If the amount required to repay the Refinanced Target
Indebtedness on the Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the outstanding amount as of June 30, 2021, the amount of
cash on balance sheet following the Transactions will be reduced commensurately to fund any shortfall in order
to complete the Transactions. See “—Sources and Uses.”

We refer to the incorporation of the Issuer, the Acquisition, the Financing, the Refinancing, the entry into the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Shareholder Funding and the application of proceeds as set forth under
“Use of Proceeds,” collectively, as the “Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**Escrow Account**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the
Offering into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on
a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrowed
Property is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition
promptly following release of the funds in the Escrow Account. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow_
Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to the Special Mandatory
Redemption. The Special Mandatory Redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate
issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to,


18


-----

but excluding, the date of such Special Mandatory Redemption. Pursuant to a shortfall agreement between the
Issuer and HoldCo to be entered on or about the Issue Date, HoldCo will be required to contribute to the Escrow
Account an amount necessary to fund the accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if
any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of such Special Mandatory Redemption, as well as negative
interest accruing on the Escrow Account during such period (if any). Amounts may be released from the Escrow
Accounts prior to the Acquisition Closing Date to pay negative interest charged on the Escrow Account and to
pay interest on the Notes on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the release of the
proceeds from escrow. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—If the conditions of the escrow are not satisfied on or prior to
_the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain_
_the return you expect on the Notes. In addition, the Issuer might not have sufficient funds to pay all of the_
_amounts due to the holders of the Notes in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

**Sources and Uses**

The estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table
below assuming the Acquisition Closing Date had occurred on June 30, 2021. Actual amounts will vary from the
amounts shown in this table depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition Closing Date, the
outstanding amount of borrowings and accrued interest under the Refinanced Target Indebtedness on such date,
the amount of cash available on the balance sheet of the Target on such date and differences from our estimates
of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions.

(1) The Shareholder Funding comprises (a) an equity contribution to be provided by HoldCo to the Issuer (in the amount of €182.0 million)
and (b) a deeply subordinated shareholder loan by HoldCo to the Issuer for an amount of €728.1 million (the “Shareholder Loan”).

(2) Represents the amount of cash and cash equivalents on the Target’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 that is expected to be used,
together with a portion of the amounts made available under the Funding Loan, to repay in full and cancel the Refinanced Target
Indebtedness on the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.”

(3) Represents the estimated cash purchase price payable to the Sellers for the shares of the Target to be acquired under the Acquisition
Agreement on the Acquisition Closing Date and to be financed by using the proceeds from the Shareholder Funding and all the proceeds
from virtual tranche A (“Tranche A”) under the Notes, as further described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, which we expect Target to repay in
full and cancel on the Acquisition Closing Date using the proceeds from the Funding Loan, to be made by the Issuer to the Target on or
about the Acquisition Closing Date by using a portion of the proceeds from virtual tranche B (“Tranche B”) under the Notes, as further
described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above. The principal amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness shown in the
table above excludes accrued and unpaid interest of €0.6 million as of June 30, 2021. The principal amount of Refinanced Target
Indebtedness as well as the amount of accrued and unpaid interest outstanding and payable on the Acquisition Closing Date may vary
from the amounts outstanding and due on June 30, 2021. If the amount required to repay the Refinanced Target Indebtedness on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount set forth in the table above, the amount of cash on balance sheet following the
Transactions will be reduced commensurately. See “Capitalization.”

(5) Represents the estimated fees and expenses that will be payable in connection with the Transactions, including legal and other advisor
fees and transaction expenses to be financed with all the proceeds from virtual tranche C (“Tranche C”) under the Notes, as further
described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above. The actual amount of fees and expenses payable on the Acquisition
Closing Date may differ from the estimated amount shown in the table above. If the actual amount of fees and expenses payable on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount set forth in the table above, the amount of cash on balance sheet following the
Transactions will be reduced commensurately.

(6) Represents the estimated amount of cash that will be funded to the Target’s balance sheet in connection with the Transactions, which will
be used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, funding future capital expenditures, the payment of interest or the
repayment of debt, including the Refinanced Target Indebtedness in the event the amount required to repay such indebtedness on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness set forth in the table above. See
“Capitalization.”

**Post-Completion Merger**

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any
relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with the Target in
accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code, which we expect to be resolved upon
by (and exclusively involve) the Issuer and the Target (the “Post-Completion Merger”), during the 18 months
following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of the Notes—Post-Completion Merger.” We refer to
the surviving entity of the Post-Completion Merger as “MergerCo.” Failure to complete the Post-Completion
Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Post-Completion Merger
will be subject to certain conditions and requirements and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion_
_Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

In the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off
Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws.
See “Description of the Notes—Guarantee,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations_
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_
_and enforceability.”_

**Current Trading**

Based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently
available, we estimate that our total revenues and other income increased by €3.0 million, or 9.6%, from
€31.3 million for the two months ended August 31, 2020 to €34.3 million for the two months ended August 31,
2021. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. We estimate that for the same
periods our Adjusted EBITDA increased from €17.3 million (an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 55.2%) to
€19.8 million (an Adjusted EBITDA Margin 57.7%).

_The preliminary financial results presented above are derived from our accounting records and internal_
_management accounts. This information has not been audited or reviewed, nor have any procedures been_
_performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance_
_on it, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto. Our preliminary financial_

(1) Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group will indirectly control the Target through
its wholly owned subsidiary LuxCo. LuxCo will own 75% of the share capital of HoldCo, while Cometa will hold the remaining 25%.
Funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group will initially hold the entire issued share capital of LuxCo. On or after the Acquisition
Closing Date, SCP EPC UK Limited, which is a Seller and a vehicle managed by Searchlight Capital Partners L.P., may reinvest for a
stake of up to approximately 10% to 15% of Luxco or a holding company thereof. Certain governance and other rights of the
shareholders in HoldCo will be governed by the Shareholder Agreement. See “Principal Shareholders—the Shareholder Agreement.” On
or following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Sponsor plans to implement a management incentive participation program for certain
directors, managers and officers of the Group to subscribe for certain equity instruments of Holdco. See “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan.”_

(2) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €125.0 million. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The initial borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the Issuer. Under_
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to applicable laws, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have
been repaid in full. We currently expect that the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing Date.

(3) The Notes will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and
future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. On the Issue Date, the
Notes will be secured, subject to certain perfection requirements, by the Escrowed Property. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date,
the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Completion Collateral.
Within 20 Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Completion Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedging obligations (if any) on a pari passu basis. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to applicable laws,
in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. Any remaining
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the


22


-----

Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any subsidiary permitted to be incurred and secured by such
Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The security interests in the Collateral will be limited by applicable
law and subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances.
Although future subsidiaries of MergerCo may be required to grant note guarantees in the future under certain circumstances as
described under “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants—Future Guarantees,” as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is
not expected that the Notes will be guaranteed if the Post-Completion Merger is completed. For further information, see “Description of
_the Notes—Security,” “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and_
_the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_

(4) On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will make the Funding Loan with a portion of the proceeds under Tranche B (as defined
under “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to enable the Target to refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness and pay related fees and
expenses, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantee and the Collateral—The principal amount of the Funding Loan may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of_
_certain indebtedness of the Target prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.” We expect that (i) the Rolled Target Indebtedness in a_
principal amount of €15.9 million and (ii) certain lease liabilities in a principal amount of €89.2 million will remain outstanding
following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Rolled Target
_Indebtedness.” The proceeds from the Funding Loan will be used by the Target as described under “Use of Proceeds.” The amount of the_
Funding Loan is estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and may change depending on several factors, including the
timing of the Acquisition Closing Date.

(5) The Transactions will be primarily financed with (i) proceeds from the Offering in an aggregate principal amount of €375.0 million and
(ii) €910.1 million of shareholder funding in the form of (a) an equity contribution to be provided by HoldCo to the Issuer (in the amount
of €182.0 million) and (b) a deeply subordinated and non-interest bearing shareholder loan by HoldCo to the Issuer for an amount of
€728.1 million (the “Shareholder Loan”). The Shareholder Loan will be entered into on or about the Acquisition Closing Date and it
will be governed by Italian Law. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Shareholder Loan, (i) the Issuer and HoldCo will agree
that all their rights under the Shareholder Loan will be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and that, prior to the maturity date thereof,
the Issuer shall only be permitted to make a payment due under the Shareholder Loan to the extent such payment is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable finance documents (including the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement),
(ii) the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Shareholder Loan will be subordinated to the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain future liabilities of the Issuer, and (iii) the Shareholder Loan shall be subordinated to all current and future financial and
non-financial liabilities of the Issuer, including with respect to trade creditors.

(6) The Issuer is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni). The Issuer is
currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions, the management of the Target following
the Acquisition and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend
to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the
Issuer with the Target in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law and as further described herein, with MergerCo being the
surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of the Notes—Post-Completion
_Merger.” The Post-Completion Merger will be subject to certain conditions and requirements and may not be completed. See “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger_
_within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” As of the Issue Date, the Target has no subsidiaries and therefore, following the Post-_
Completion Merger, MergerCo is not expected to have any subsidiaries and to be the sole obligor under the Indenture.

(7) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. In the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off
Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date. See “Description of the
_Notes—Guarantee.” Following the Acquisition Closing Date and prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post_
Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be
structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the
Target). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and subject
to any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target (if any). After the Post-Completion Merger, no future subsidiary (if any) of MergerCo is
expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of any future subsidiaries of MergerCo or the Target, as the case may be. The Guarantee will be subject to certain material
contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,” “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of any Guarantee and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and may_
be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Notes—Guarantee.”

**Ranking of the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will:

                         - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer and, subsequent to the
Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo;

                         - be secured as set forth under “—Security”;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment to any existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the
Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain hedging obligations related thereto (if
any);

                         - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes;

                         - rank effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of
the Issuer that is not secured by the Collateral or the Escrowed
Property to the extent of the value of the Collateral or the
Escrowed Property;

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer or of any future
subsidiaries of the Issuer that are secured by property or assets
that do not secure the Notes, or that secures such other


24


-----

indebtedness on a super senior basis (including obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations related thereto (if any)), to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such other indebtedness or
obligation;

                         - be, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable laws; and

                         - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness or obligations of any future subsidiaries of the
Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) that are not Guarantors,
including prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Rolled
Indebtedness of the Target and obligations owed to trade
creditors.

**Guarantee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. In the event the
Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the date falling
18 months after the Acquisition Closing (the “Cut-Off Date”), the
Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant
limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Target guarantees the
Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date.

Pursuant to the Indenture and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Agreed Security Principles, each subsidiary of the Issuer that
guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other
indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor (as defined
below) that is a subsidiary of the Issuer, shall enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement. For purposes of this Offering Memorandum,
the term “Guarantors” shall refer to the any subsidiary of the Issuer
that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the
Indenture on or after the Acquisition Closing Date and the term
“Guarantee” shall refer to the guarantees of the Notes by the
Guarantor (if granted following the Cut-Off Date as below).

Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the PostCompletion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date,
prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be
structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the
Target). In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur
and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and subject to
any limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to
any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target.

After the Post-Completion Merger, none of MergerCo’s subsidiaries
is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be
structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. The Guarantee
will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations.
By virtue of these limitations, the Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency _Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantee and the Security Interests,” “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The_


25


-----

_Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantee and the
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital_
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of any_
_Guarantee_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral.”_ See _“Description_ _of_ _Certain_
_Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ and
“Description of the Notes—Guarantee.”

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . . . . .** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will, if and when granted:

                         - be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future
indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated
in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee;

                         - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future
indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee;

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by property or
assets that do not secure that Guarantor’s Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
indebtedness; and

                         - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade
creditors) of the subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not
guarantee the Notes; and

                         - be subject to the limitations described under “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and_
_“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and_
_the Collateral—The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_their validity and enforceability.”_

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, subject to certain perfection requirements, the
Notes will only be secured by the Escrowed Property, on a first
priority basis.

On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will
be secured by the Completion Collateral.

Within 20 Business Days from (and excluding) the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured by the PostCompletion Collateral.

Each of the Escrowed Property, the Completion Collateral and the
Post-Completion Collateral is further described under “Description of
_the Notes—Security.” The Collateral will also secure the obligations_
of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations (if any). In the event of an enforcement in respect of the
Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such


26


-----

Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and
counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid
in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee
_and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility_
_and_ _counterparties_ _to_ _certain_ _hedging_ _obligations_ _and_ _future_
_indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the_
_Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis_
_are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the_
_Collateral in priority over the Notes,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The Collateral will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_
_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity_ _and_ _enforceability,”_ and “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. In
addition, the security interests in the Collateral may be released under
certain circumstances. Subject to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future
indebtedness. For more information on the security interests granted,
see “Description of the Notes—Security” and for more information on
potential limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency
_Law_ _Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _the_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the_
_Collateral.”_

**Post-Completion Merger . . . . . . . . . . .** Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use
commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/
or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with
the Target in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the
Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with
MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following
the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—The Post-Completion Merger.” The Post-Completion_
_Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed._
_See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the_
_Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion_
_Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon release from escrow, the gross proceeds from the Offering will
be used, together with the Shareholder Funding and, as applicable,
cash on the Target’s balance sheet, to (i) finance the purchase price
for the Acquisition, (ii) refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness,
(iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and
(iv) fund cash to the Target’s balance sheet for general corporate
purposes. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option,
to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, plus a “make whole” premium, as described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including


27


-----

the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in
each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding, the date of redemption.
In addition, prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem, at its
option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with
the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption
prices set forth in “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after
September 30, 2024, at the relevant redemption prices described
under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Withholding Taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Except as provided in “Description of the Notes”, all payments made
by or on behalf of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be made
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes or other governmental charges in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction unless required by law. If withholding or deduction for,
on account of, such taxes is required to be made by law with respect
to any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer with respect to
any Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the
holders of Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than
the amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction (the “Additional **Amounts”).** See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” The Issuer is
incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore
payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain
circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax
laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any_
additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or
deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461
except, in the case of Decree No. 239 and Decree No. 461, where the
procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, in
order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due
solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or their agents. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Although we believe
that, under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed
under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of the Notes
is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (as identified
currently in Ministerial Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently
amended and supplemented and, in the future, any decree to be issued
under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239; any such decree, the
“White List” and such holder of the Notes complies with certain
certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the
case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change
in Decree No. 239 or in Decree No. 461 after the date hereof,
including any change in the White List. See “Certain _tax_
_considerations—Certain Italian tax considerations.”_

**Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law (or in its interpretation) of any Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction become effective on or after the Issue Date and,
as a result, the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest
payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay
Additional Amounts and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Issuer, the Issuer may redeem
the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price


28


-----

of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the
purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred in respect of the Notes if a specified consolidated total net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In connection with certain tender offers for either series of Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to
redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but
not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer, in any case not
below par. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—
_General.”_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will,
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit
the gross proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account. The
Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged
in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The
release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the
completion of the Acquisition on the terms set forth in the Acquisition
Agreement will occur promptly after such release (and in any event
within one Business Day therefrom). The completion of the
Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including, among others, certain regulatory approvals and the
performance of certain closing actions. If the conditions to the release
of the Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events,
the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption. The
Special Mandatory Redemption price of the Notes will be equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date
to, but excluding, the date of such Special Mandatory Redemption.
Pursuant to a shortfall agreement between the Issuer and HoldCo to
be entered on or about the Issue Date, HoldCo will be required to
contribute to the Escrow Account an amount necessary to fund the
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if
any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of such Special
Mandatory Redemption, as well as negative interest accruing on the
Escrow Account during such period (if any). See “Description of the
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries (if any) and, in certain cases, HoldCo to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - make certain restricted payments;

                         - make certain investments;

                         - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                         - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset
sales;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes;

                         - carry out certain activities prior to the consummation of the PostCompletion Merger; and

                         - guarantee certain indebtedness.

Certain of the covenants and events of default will be suspended if
and for so long as we achieve investment-grade ratings. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—Suspension_ _of_
_Covenants and Release of Security Interests on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.”_

Each of the covenants in the Indenture are subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction nor will they be so registered.
The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See
“Notice to Investors.” Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit
of any exchange or registration rights.

**Exchange . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the
Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or
that such listing will be maintained.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Indenture will be governed by New York law. The
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be governed by the
laws of England and Wales. The Security Documents will be
governed by the laws of Italy.

_The unaudited historical financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 is calculated by adding_
_the financial information for the year ended March 31, 2021 to the financial information for the three month_
_period ended June 30, 2021, and subtracting the financial information for the three month period ended June 30,_
_2020. The results of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 have been prepared solely for the_
_purposes of this Offering Memorandum and are for illustrative purposes only._

_profit and loss and comprehensive income, and June 30, 2021, in the case of summary unaudited as adjusted_
_statement of financial position information. The summary unaudited as adjusted financial and other data is_
_presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our actual interest expense_
_actually would have been if the Transactions had occurred on July 1, 2020, or what our actual financial position_
_would have been had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2021, or on any other date, and such data does not_
_purport to project our financial results for any future period._

_The summary financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we use to evaluate our_

(1) We define “Reported EBITDA” as profit (loss) for the year/period before income taxes, financial income and financial expenses,
depreciation and amortization, impairment losses on trade receivables and other financial assets, impairment losses on non-current assets
and long-term incentive plan (LTIP). We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as Reported EBITDA as adjusted for certain advertising costs,
monitoring fees, transactions costs, commission and activations fees, CPE installation related costs, ADSL business and other sundry
adjustments as described below. We define “Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the
full period effect of new subscribers as of June 30, 2021 as described below. Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Reported EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to net profit/(loss), as measures of our operating performance, cash flows from
operating, investing and financing activities, as measures of our ability to meet our cash needs or any other measure of performance
under generally accepted accounting principles. Given certain one-off transactions that have had a significant impact on EOLO S.p.A.’s
profit or loss statement, the growth in our subscriber base and the extensive investments in network expansion that have been made
during the periods under review, EOLO’s management monitors Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA for purposes of internal capital allocation decision-making and budget planning. Each of the adjustments comprising Reported
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is further described in the footnotes below.

These Non-IFRS Measures are presented in this Offering Memorandum because EOLO’s management believes that they can assist
readers to understand the underlying dynamics of the core business operations of EOLO S.p.A., and that they provide meaningful and
relevant financial information that is useful in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s operations in the same manner as management views and
operates the business. EOLO’s management presents the foregoing Non-IFRS Measures because similar measures are widely used by
investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist
in the analysis of our results of operations and ability to service debt. However, such Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Readers are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons EOLO’s

(a) _Impairment losses on trade receivables and other financial assets: refers to incurred and expected losses on trade and other_
receivables. For purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA, management performed this adjustment in order to illustrate the
performance of our business as it evolves with the changes in our subscriber base over the periods under review.

(b) _Impairment losses on non-current assets: refers to the reduction in the value of our certain assets within property, plant and_
equipment due to obsolescence. As a non-cash effect, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Reported
EBITDA to better illustrate the performance associated with our business.

(c) _LTIP: represents the accrual of the award to senior management of one-off payments under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)_
in place prior to the Transactions. The LTIP had an original timeframe up to 2025 and contemplated a one off payment to senior
management linked to specific, pre-agreed liquidity events such the sale of EOLO. Every fiscal year a liability is recorded as a
charge to the statement of profit and loss based on the estimated payout and trigger date. For the year ended March 31, 2021 and the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, as the sale process started in January 2021 and a sale had become probable prior to the original
LTIP duration (2025), the valuation we performed in connection with the Acquisition triggered a significant accrual. The LTIP is
expected to be replaced by a new Management Co-Investment Plan. It is expected that members of senior management will
re-invest part of the proceeds received under the LTIP into the new Management Co-Investment Plan and/or in connection with the
reinvestment related to the Acquisition. As the LTIP accrual was one-off, management performed this adjustment for the purposes
of preparing Reported EBITDA. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan”
and “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.”

(d) _2020 institutional advertising campaign: represent the costs associated with an institutional and exceptional advertising campaign_
realized in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness towards authorities of the role that EOLO plays in the
Italian internet connectivity landscape. As management considers this campaign as a one-off and connected to the fact that it was
necessary to highlight the need for connectivity in Italy outside of large urban areas and their immediate environs which became
more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted
EBITDA.

(e) _Monitoring fees: represent the fees paid to our current shareholders for their consulting, monitoring and advisory services._
Management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to illustrate the performance of the
underlying business without giving effect to the shareholding structure which will change with the Acquisition. See “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Acquisition.”_

-----

(f) _Transactions costs: represent costs, including external M&A advisors and financial, commercial and legal due diligence fees and_
expenses, in respect of the Acquisition in 2021 and a new capital expenditure line signed in 2019. As these are one-off costs that
were incurred in connection with extraordinary transactions, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing
Adjusted EBITDA.

(g) _Commission and activation fees: represent the net EBITDA contribution of new clients’ acquisition, including revenues for_
activation fees and sales commissions paid to our salesforce. Revenues for activation fees are deferred over the contract term agreed
with the customer (mainly 24 months). Sales commissions are capitalized as “contract costs” since they are considered incremental
costs of obtaining a contract. They are recognized as operating expense over a period of 24 months consistent with the pattern of
transfer of service to which they relate and the judgment that management applied in the revenue recognition policy. Most of our
telecommunications competitors recognize such items in profit or loss over a longer period, based on their estimate of customers’
propensity to discontinue their subscriptions. For illustrative purposes, this adjustment applies such a convention assuming a period
of time of seven years. Management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating our results of operations
compared to our competitors.

(h) _CPE installation related costs: our business requires CPEs, which are devices that enable consumers to access communication_
services and permit us to distribute our services. Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned customers in order to
efficiently use our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of this adjustment:
(i) installation costs for re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/substituting and
upselling of CPEs associated with subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to relieve network
bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then reconditioned and
reused), and (iv) installation costs for activation “KO” which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation at potential new
customers’ premises, where the subscription was aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the site (i.e., no
line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). They represent relocation costs and therefore do not qualify for recognition
as part of property, plant and equipment under IFRS. EOLO’s management considers such costs as part of the costs incurred for
creation, improvement and maintenance of its infrastructure network and therefore added it back for purposes of preparing Adjusted
EBITDA. Based on the above, EOLO’s management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating the operating
results obtained through our infrastructure network. Moreover, the same adjustment is utilized in calculating Adjusted Capital
Expenditure as described under footnote (3) to show the overall investment in our infrastructure network, with no impact on cash
flows.

(i) _Legacy ADSL business: this adjustment adds back the net negative EBITDA contribution associated with the ADSL business._
ADSL represents a form of delivering broadband connectivity using telephone lines and is considered an obsolete technology that
generally provides slower navigation and is more expensive to deliver than FWA technology, our core business. As of June 30,
2021, we had approximately 500 residual subscribers of ADSL services. We are actively encouraging ADSL subscribers to migrate
to other technologies. Due to the fact that EOLO’s management will not further invest in ADSL technology, management
performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA as it can assist investors in understanding EOLO’s core
business.

(j) _Other: mainly includes grants from Infratel on items that have been recognized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated_
over time. In order to adjust for one-off and non-operating income items, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for
purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, for the year ended March 31, 2019, this line item includes the reversal of a
payroll item that by its nature EOLO’s management believes is similar to the payroll expenses that were capitalized in the year
ended March 31, 2019.

(k) _Run-Rate impact: is calculated as the EBITDA that EOLO would have generated during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021_
period if subscribers as of June 30, 2021 had been subscribers for the entire period, applying the Blended ARPU for the twelve
months period to such subscriber base. Management considers that this adjustment shows, on an illustrative basis, the cash
generation effect of new customer acquisitions driven by recent structural trends that have increased demand for high-speed
connectivity. This further adjustment to Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to
present what EBITDA would have been had these new subscribers been acquired on July 1, 2020 nor does it purport to project
EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying this adjustment are based on our current estimates and they involve
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from future results or
performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Run-Rate
_Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum is based on estimates and assumptions in respect of certain adjustments_
_which are subject to significant uncertainties.”_

(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin are defined as Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
_divided by total revenue and other income, expressed as a percentage, as applicable._

(3) We define “Adjusted Capital Expenditures” as Total Capital Expenditures (which is the sum of acquisitions of intangible assets and
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment as reported in accordance with IFRS) as adjusted for the capitalization of CPE related
installation capital expenditures, IRU lease costs, disposals, other sundry items and other minor items. Adjusted Capital Expenditures is
not a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted Capital Expenditures as an alternative to cash
flows used in investing activities or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. See “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

Given the extensive investments in network expansion that have been made during the periods under review, management monitors
Adjusted Capital Expenditures for purposes of evaluating the allocation of capital and planning network expansion and tracing payoff of
investments which combines a capitalized and operating expenditure view. Each of the adjustments comprising Adjusted Capital
Expenditure is further described in the footnotes below.

The following table reconciles our Total Capital Expenditures (which is the sum of acquisitions of
intangible assets and acquisitions of property, plant and equipment as reported in accordance with IFRS) to
Adjusted Capital Expenditures for each of the periods indicated:

**Year ended March 31,** **Three months ended June 30,**

**Adjusted Capital Expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **88.7** **91.8** **122.8** **28.9** **36.2**

(a) _CPE related installation capital expenditures: our business requires CPEs, which are devices that enable consumers to access_
communication services and permit us to distribute our services. Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned
customers in order to efficiently use our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of
this adjustment: (i) installation costs for re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/
substituting and upselling of CPEs associated with subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to
relieve network bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then
reconditioned and reused), and (iv) costs related to “KO” installations which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation
at potential new customers’ premises, where the subscription was aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the
site (i.e., no line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). In order for EOLO’s management to track expenditure by
nature and benchmark the efficiency of its investments and allocations of cash, and to assist readers in evaluating EOLO S.p.A.’s
expenditures during the periods under review, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment to Total Capital Expenditures. See
footnote (1) above for more information on this adjustment.

(b) _IRU leases: costs related to IRU Contracts which are multi-year rights to use fiber optic (dark fiber). They represent leases under_
IFRS 16 and cannot be capitalized. IRU lease costs, however, expand with the expansion of our network. In order to model its
expenditure, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted Capital Expenditures.

(c) _Other: consists of other sundry items that, due to their nature, management considers appropriate to present as part of Adjusted_
Capital Expenditures as they are related to network expansion.

(d) _Other Minor: consists of inventory disposals and certain other minor expenditures which are ancillary to management of our asset_
base and/or network expansion.

(4) We define “Operating Free Cash Flow” as net cash flows generated by operating activities as reported in accordance with IFRS as
adjusted for CPE installation related cash flow, the variation attributable to the phasing of certain Adjusted Capital Expenditure-related
payables and other items. We define “Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth)” as Operating Free Cash Flow as further adjusted for
hosting lease payments, other operating items and CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures. None of Operating Free Cash Flow or Cash
Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Operating Free Cash
Flow or Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) as alternatives to net cash flows generated by operating activities or any other
measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Non-IFRS Measures.”_

EOLO’s management believes that Operating Free Cash Flow is a useful Non-IFRS Measure to use in evaluating business performance
and to inform future expenditure planning because it illustrates cash generation on a basis that is comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted Capital Expenditure, permitting EOLO’s management to analyze the business in a consistent manner. Furthermore, EOLO’s
management believes that or Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is a relevant Non-IFRS Measure that can assist in capital
allocation and planning operating and capital expenditures based on ability of the business to generate cash. Each of the adjustments
comprising Operating Free Cash Flow and Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) is further described in the footnotes below.

  - For more information about our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) for the three months ended June 30, 2021, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Total Capital Expenditures and
_Adjusted Capital Expenditures”_

(a) _CPE related installation cash flow: relates to the cash flow effect of the CPE installation related costs adjustment that is performed_
above in footnote (1) for Adjusted EBITDA. EOLO’s management performed this adjustment in order to, inter alia, model the cash
flow effect of our re-use/repair/substitution/upselling of CPEs, which is a pillar of EOLO S.p.A.’s strategy.

(b) _Phasing of Adjusted Capital Expenditures: relates to the cash outflow attributable to days payable outstanding (typically between_
60-90 days) of Adjusted Capital Expenditures as the payment for the capital expenditures may be made in another period than the
recording of the expenditure. In order to facilitate comparison over period for budgetary and expenditure planning purposes,
EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Operating Free Cash Flow.

(c) _Other: relates mostly to grants from Infratel. For accounting purposes, the recognition of the amount of the grants received are_
typically accounted based on the amortization of the related capital expenditure. In order to illustrate the cash inflows of the
business, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Operating Free Cash Flow.

(d) _Hosting lease payments: the coverage of our FWA network depends in part on our ability to maintain existing BTS and to build up_
new BTS for our network. Our BTS are generally installed on towers owned by third parties, the use of which is secured by way of
lease agreements. Given the essential nature of such payments, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of
preparing Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth).

(e) _Other operating items: relates to certain other sundry operating items that management believes are non-discretionary and therefore_
EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth).

(f) _CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures: represents the portion of Adjusted Capital Expenditures that EOLO has allocated to current_
customer base (as opposed to growth). This Adjusted Capital Expenditure is considered necessary for maintaining the current
subscriber base and therefore is useful and relevant to illustrate the cash effect of EOLO S.p.A.’s minimum cash outflow prior to
determining any growth budget and preparing Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth). See footnote (2) and “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Total Capital_
_Expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures.”_

(5) Cash Conversion is defined as Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(6) We define “Working Capital” as trade receivables, contract costs and other current liabilities less trade payables, contract liabilities and
other current liabilities. The following sets forth a calculation of Working Capital.

**As of March 31,** **As of June 30,**

(7) As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents reflects the cash and cash equivalents of the Target as of June 30, 2021 (x) adjusted to give
effect to the receipt by the Issuer of the gross proceeds from the Offering (€375.0 million) and the Shareholder Funding (€910.1 million),
the payment of the cash purchase price for the Acquisition (€1,125.0 million), the repayment of the Refinanced Target Indebtedness
expected to be outstanding on the Acquisition Closing Date (€119.9 million) and the payment of estimated transaction fees and expenses
(€14.0 million) in connection with the Transactions, in each case, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021. As Adjusted Cash and Cash
Equivalents as of June 30, 2021 does not include any other adjustments to our cash and cash equivalents due to working capital
expansion or contraction or any other cash generation or utilization since June 30, 2021. As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual cash position would have been had the Transactions
occurred on June 30, 2021, nor does it purport to project our cash position at any future date. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents
as of the Issue Date, the Acquisition Closing Date or any future date may be higher or lower than the amount of cash and cash
equivalents as shown in the table above. For further information, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Recent Trading” and
“Capitalization.”

(8) As Adjusted Senior Secured Net Debt represents indebtedness under the Notes less As Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents, in each
case, after giving effect to the Transactions and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing
Date. See “Capitalization.”

(9) As Adjusted Net Debt represents our total indebtedness, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the application of the
proceeds from the Offering (defined as the sum of the Notes, the Rolled Target Indebtedness and Lease liabilities under IFRS 16) less As
Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents. As Adjusted Net Debt is presented excluding the Shareholder Loan. See also “Capitalization.”

(10) As Adjusted Cash Interest Expense reflects the as actual interest expense of the Issuer for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, as if
the Notes had been issued on July 1, 2020 and the proceeds therefrom had been used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” This estimate
reflects the issuance of €375.0 million 4.875% Senior Secured Notes issued at a price of 100.0%. As Adjusted Cash Interest Expense
excludes commitment fees on undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility but includes interest accruing on the €15.9 million
of the Rolled Target Indebtedness and €89.2 million of the lease liabilities that, in each case, we expect will remain outstanding
following the Transactions, as further described under “Capitalization.” As Adjusted Cash Interest Expense is presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issue of the Notes occurred
on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at any future
date.

capacity. They relate to:

a) CPEs which are installed only after the execution of a new contract with the client. If the client decides to terminate the contract, we
charge a penalty to retrieve CPEs from a customer’s premises. The amount only includes capital expenditures invested for
successful installations;

b) BTS which are spent only after a network planning process has been established; and

c) Increase data capacity.

(2) Current Customer Base (“CCB”) Adjusted Capital Expenditures relate to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base
(e.g. maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling toward 28GHz spectrum) and replacing churned customers with new

**_Our ability to obtain all licenses, permits, rights of use or other authorizations required to operate our_**
**_business and/or expand our network or any other required licenses, permits or other authorizations is subject_**
**_to risks and uncertainties._**

The operation of telecommunications networks and the provision of related services and ancillary activities are
regulated by governmental and/or regulatory authorities. Our operating licenses or authorizations specify radio
bandwidths that we can use to transmit data. The terms of our licenses and frequency allocations are established
by the MED and the AGCOM and, in some cases, are subject to modification or early termination (with the
confirmation of the right for the following period with the payment of the contributions due in advance).

We currently have the right to use the following frequencies: 26 GHz, 28 GHz, 3.5 GHz (only in the Valle
D’Aosta region) and 6-11-13-18-80 GHz. Rights to use frequencies are subject to term limits and must be
renewed from time to time. Applicable law requires that authorities conduct an open, transparent and
non-discriminatory procedure which, among others: (a) take into account the fulfilment of the objectives of the
Directive 2018/1972 (e.g., promote connectivity, access to competition, efficiency, harmonization); (b) give all
interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation; and (c) clearly state the
reasons for such possible renewal. In particular, our 26 GHz (used for our distribution network) and 28 GHz
(used for our access network) licenses, expire on December 31, 2022. We filed a request for extension on July 8,
2019 for our 28 GHz license and on February 12, 2021 for our 26 GHz license and the procedures for the
extension are currently expected to be finalized by end of 2021 and by the first quarter of 2022, respectively. If
we fail to renew any of our licenses, permits, rights to use or other authorizations we may lose the ability to
continue to operate the relevant business and the realizable value of our relevant network infrastructure and
related assets may be materially adversely affected. The procedure to obtain licenses, permits, rights to use or
other authorizations (and renewals thereof) may be complex lengthy and may require ongoing compliance with
various obligations. Moreover, even if we obtain the renewal of our licenses, permits, right to use or
authorizations, the costs for obtaining those might be higher than those we expect. Finally, if we fail to comply
with the requirements of the applicable legislation and regulatory framework in general, which is very detailed
and complex in nature, or we fail to meet any of the terms of the licenses, our licenses necessary for our
operations may be suspended or terminated or significant fines imposed. See “—Our business is capital
_intensive. It cannot be assumed that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs or_
_our on-going operations in the future.”_

In addition, we are authorized by the MED to provide the following electronic communications services: a
General authorization for the supply of electronic communications network and services, issued on July 28, 2014;
General Authorization for Internet Service (ISP), pursuant to an authorization issued on November 11, 2006;
WISP (IFI Internet Service Provider), pursuant to an authorization issued on July 15, 2005; and VOIP (Voice
over IP), pursuant to an authorization issued on May 29, 2006 (together, the “General Authorizations”). The
General Authorizations were granted for a period of 20 years. The procedure for the extension of the General
Authorizations similar to the procedure for the renewal of the licenses. We have in the past applied and, will in
the future apply, to the MED to obtain the renewal of the General Authorizations but there can be no assurance,
that any application for the renewal of one or more of the General Authorizations upon their expiration will be
successful or the renewal will be granted on equivalent or satisfactory terms.

Although we have a dedicated team tasked with obtaining, monitoring compliance with, and renewing the
required licenses, permits and other authorizations, due to the inherent challenges of these regimes, we may
experience difficulties in obtaining, complying with, and securing the renewal of necessary licenses, permits and

41


-----

authorizations. If we are not successful in doing so, we may not be able to find and implement feasible
alternatives to using these licenses, permits and authorizations, may incur substantial costs in doing so, and may
be subject to fines or penalties. As a consequence, we may operate our FWA network on a limited basis, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.

Similarly, the build-out and operation of our FWA network and/or regulatory authorities, particularly in relation
to rights of way. These approvals and permits may include building, construction and environmental permits,
antenna and mast deployment approvals and various other planning permissions. Obtaining these approvals and
permits can be a complex process. Our network was supported by approximately 3,400 BTS as of August 31,
2021. Given the multitude of regulations that govern such equipment and the various permits required to operate
our network, we cannot be certain that our right to use a portion of our transmission system will not be
challenged. Operating a BTS without the required permits could result in fines or legal proceedings seeking to
have the BTS removed. Furthermore, local residents may challenge our right to operate a BTS regardless of
whether or not we have obtained the requisite permits and authorizations. The loss of the right to use a material
number of BTS or any strategically located BTS could have a disruptive effect on the operation of our FWA
network in a service area.

**_The success of our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If we are unable to_**
**_successfully manage our subscriber turnover or otherwise lose subscribers, we may face reduced revenues or_**
**_lower cash flows._**

Our ability to attract and retain subscribers for our FWA offering in our Core TAM is uncertain and will depend
on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, among others, the business
strategies and capabilities of our competitors, prevailing market conditions, the development of new and/or
alternate technologies for fixed telecommunications products and services and the effect of applicable
regulations.

Our ability to attract new subscribers or to grow our Blended ARPU from existing subscribers will depend in
large part upon our ability to offer high quality and attractively priced services, stimulate and increase subscriber
usage, convince subscribers to switch from competing operators to our FWA services and our ability to manage
churn. A small portion of our subscribers are prepaid, which also contributes to churn, as these subscribers are
not contractually bound in the long-term to use our services and are free to move to other operators with more
attractive pricing or other advantages. If we fail to reduce or maintain our rates of churn, or competing operators
improve their ability to retain subscribers and thereby lower their churn levels, our cost of retaining and acquiring
new subscribers could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Further, our ability to attract new subscribers may also be negatively affected by a slowdown in the Italian
economy and the European economy as a whole. See “—Our business, financial condition, results of operations
_and liquidity may be adversely affected by disruptive geopolitical or macroeconomic events and economic_
_uncertainty in Italy.”_

In addition, customer support services help us build and maintain good relationships with our customers, which is
critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. We believe that our delivery and installation activities are
a crucial element in allowing our distribution and service channels to meet customer expectations and drive
revenue growth. We rely on a consolidated and trusted team of approximately 600 local contractor companies
and 1,500 external technicians and 30 internal technicians as of March 31, 2021. If our internal team or our
external specialists do not provide adequate levels of assistance to our customers (including in the installation
phase), our customer satisfaction levels may decline and our churn rate may increase, which, in turn, may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our operations depend on our ability to efficiently operate our systems and controls that are subject to failure_**
**_that could affect our business and our reputation._**

Our success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our controls, network technology
systems and of certain hardware. Our technical infrastructure (including our network infrastructure and
information technology) is vulnerable to damage or, among other things, interruption from information and
telecommunication technology failures, power loss, floods, windstorms, fires, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing,
human error and similar events. For example, we currently operate one data center facility for our core network
infrastructure, with one backup recovery facility; the disruption of these facilities could adversely impact our
FWA network. In addition, an unexpected increase in volume on our network and systems could cause them to

42


-----

malfunction, such as in periods of increased demand or unexpected circumstances that may reduce our ability to
service our infrastructure. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased demand for streamed
entertainment and online working and learning led to an increased demand for reliable and fast connectivity
significantly, which in turn led to an unexpected network overload, which resulted in more frequent technical
issues and a lower quality of service delivered to customers. Our controls are dependent on these technological
systems and are also subject to the interruptions and failures. Unanticipated problems with our controls, or at our
facilities, system failures, hardware or software failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the
quality of our services and cause service interruptions. Any of these occurrences could result in reduced user
traffic and reduced revenue and could harm our levels of customer satisfaction, our reputation and compliance
with certain of our regulatory obligations. Sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to our
growth and our ability to monitor costs, render monthly invoices, process customer orders, provide customer
service and achieve operating efficiencies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully operate and
upgrade our information and processing systems or that they will continue to perform as expected without any
failure. A severe failure in our accounting, information and processing systems could impair our ability to collect
payments from customers and respond satisfactorily to customer needs, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_If we do not continue to provide telecommunications or related services that are useful and attractive to_**
**_customers, we may not remain competitive, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and_**
**_prospects may be adversely affected. Additionally, our network requires ongoing investment to avoid_**
**_obsolescence._**

The wireless broadband market is characterized by technological change in existing systems and industry
standards combined with ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of technology to cater to changing
customer needs. Our commercial success depends in part on providing B2C and B2B services addressing
different user needs. If we are unable to anticipate customer preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable
to modify our service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may fail to attract customers or lose
existing customers. Many of the services we offer are technology-intensive and the development or acceptance of
new technologies may render such services non-competitive and/or obsolete, replace such services or reduce
prices for such services. As new technologies develop, our equipment, such as our CPE, may need to be replaced
or upgraded, we may need to acquire additional licenses and our FWA network may need to be rebuilt in whole
or in part in order to sustain our competitive position.

To respond successfully to technological advances, we may require additional capital expenditures and access to
related or enabling technologies in order to integrate the new technology with our existing technology. In
particular, while we have been working to develop our 5G NR mobile network and our own BTS router, there is
a risk that we may fail to successfully implement these innovations or may fail to do so in a timely manner,
which could put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. See “Business—Research and
_Development.”_

As the convergence of telecommunications services accelerates, we have made and will have to continue to make
substantial additional investments in new technologies to remain competitive, and changes in technology and
services may also lead us to competing with new competitors including both emerging players as well as
established technology companies entering new sectors and bundling technologies as a means of increasing their
competitive advantage. Our business and results of operations will also suffer if our new services are not
responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, are not
effectively brought to market or are not priced competitively.

The new technologies we choose may not prove to be commercially successful or profitable. We cannot be
certain that existing, proposed or as yet undeveloped technologies will not become dominant in the future and
render the technologies we use less commercially viable or profitable or that we will be successful in responding
in a timely and cost-effective way to keep up with new developments. As telecommunications technology
continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer telecommunications products and services that are, or
that are perceived to be, substantially similar or better than those offered by us. At the time we select and
advance one technology over another, it may not be possible to accurately predict which technology may prove
to be the most economical, efficient or capable of attracting subscribers or stimulating usage and we may develop
or implement a technology that does not achieve widespread commercial success or that is not compatible with
other newly developed technologies. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. If we are not successful in anticipating and responding to
technological change and resulting customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our quality of
services, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our business is capital intensive and we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure_**
**_programs or our ongoing operations in the future._**

Our business is capital intensive and will require significant amounts of cash. Historically, start-up costs,
extensive capital expenditures and operating costs have contributed to our historical losses. For the year ended
March 31, 2021, we reported cash flow generated by operating activities of €91.6 million, while our Total Capital
Expenditures was €103.1 million. In order to continue to acquire new customers and expand our business in our
Target Market, we will continue to require significant capital outlays in the foreseeable future, including the
continued build-out, maintenance and optimization of our network and expansion of our coverage and the
improvement of our ultra-broadband services.

We may also need to invest in new networks and technologies in the future, which could require significant
capital expenditures and, if network usage develops faster than we anticipate, we may require greater capital
investments in shorter time frames than it anticipates and we may not have the resources to make such
investments. In addition, costs associated with the licenses that we need in order to operate our existing networks
and technologies (and those that we may develop in the future), and costs and rental expenses related to their
deployment, could be significant. For example, we have filed a request for extension on July 8, 2019 for our 28
GHz license and on February 12, 2021 for our 26 GHz license and the procedures for the extension are currently
expected to be finalized by end of 2021 and by the first quarter of 2022, respectively. We expect that the amounts
to secure renewals of our 28 GHz and 26 GHz licenses, will be higher than those paid during the 2014, 2016 and
2018 tender procedures.

Our ability to generate cash flow and to finance our capital expenditures, current operations and debt service
obligations depends on numerous factors, including:

‰ our future operating performance;

‰ the demand and price levels for our current and projected products and services;

‰ our ability to maintain the level of technical capacity required on our networks and the
subscriber equipment and other pertinent equipment connected to our networks;

‰ our ability to successfully introduce new products and services;

‰ our ability to limit customer churn;

‰ the general economic conditions and other circumstances affecting consumer spending;

‰ competition; and

‰ legal, tax and regulatory developments affecting our business.

The amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates due to
various factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may also be required to raise additional debt or equity
financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on
our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of
these measures on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms compared to our competitors, if at all. We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to meet our capital expenditure needs, sustain our
operations or meet our other capital requirements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_We are subject to Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us_**
**_to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses_**
**_and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO._**

The Decree No. 231 introduced the corporate liability of legal persons, companies and associations without legal
personality which brought the Italian law in line with certain international conventions to which Italy is a party.
Under Decree No. 231, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad (including
corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse) in our interest or for our benefit,
by individuals having a functional relationship with us, including third party agents or intermediaries. In such
circumstances, we could be subject to economic sanctions (fines and confiscation of profits) and legal sanctions

44


-----

which could include: (i) prohibition from continuing the business affected by the criminal offenses;
(ii) suspension and revocation of current or future authorizations, licenses or concessions; (iii) prohibition from
contracting with public authorities; (iv) exclusion from subsidies, loans contributions or, where applicable, the
revocation of those already granted; and (v) prohibition on publicizing goods or services. The duration of these
disqualifications range from a minimum of three months to a maximum of two years (in very serious cases,
however, some of these disqualifications can be applied permanently in the worst scenario). The abovementioned legal sanctions may also be applied as interim measures, even during the investigations phase. As an
alternative to the legal sanctions, the court may appoint a judicial custodian to run the company, with the
consequence that the profits gained during the receivership period are automatically confiscated. Although we
maintain and implement internal anti-corruption controls and policies (including the internal control model
pursuant to Decree No. 231 and related procedures) and a specific Supervisory Body (Organismo di Vigilanza)
appointed pursuant to Decree No. 231 performs its supervisory and monitoring functions, we may also be liable
if we are not able to detect or prevent every instance of fraud, bribery and corruption involving our employees or
agents in the future and it is determined that our internal anti-corruption controls and policies are inadequate or
are not effectively implemented.

In particular, EOLO and certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are
currently involved in certain criminal proceedings stemming from a complaint filed by one of our competitors,
Linkem S.p.A. on October 14, 2016 (the “Criminal Proceeding”). EOLO has been investigated for
administrative liability according to the Decree No. 231 with reference to: (i) the criminal offence of aggravated
fraud against the Italian State; and (ii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this second charge
was dismissed by the court in November 2019). The Public Prosecutor of Busto Arsizio alleged that EOLO’s
procedures were inadequate to detect and prevent the managers’ alleged behaviors and would have generated for
EOLO an undue profit of approximately €3.5 million between 2016 and 2017. On January 25, 2021, the Public
Prosecutor issued, among others, a motion to dismiss for the aforementioned charges of aggravated fraud against
EOLO’s managers and the understanding of our counsel is that the Public Prosecutor is determined to order the
dismissal of the said charges against EOLO as well once the competent court decides on the request for dismissal
against the former and current managers of EOLO. The offence of aggravated fraud against the Italian State is
sanctioned with:

‰ Fines of up to €774,500, which might be further increased up to a maximum amount of
€929,400 in case of significant profits obtained from the crime or serious damages caused by
the crime;

‰ Ban measures (for a period ranging from three months to two years): (a) prohibition of
contracting with the Italian government except for obtaining a public service; (b) exclusion
from public funding and contributions and revocation of those previously granted;
(c) prohibition from advertising goods and services; and

‰ Mandatory disgorgement of the profits of the crime, or of an equivalent sum of money and
assets.

Although we believe that we have already implemented certain self-cleaning measures (e.g., we have
strengthened our system, including applicable controls and procedures under Decree No. 231) and our legal
counsel advised us that a guilty verdict can be considered as remote scenario considering the whole elements
under analysis and the current status of the proceeding, we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome of the
Criminal Proceeding against EOLO will be and we could be subject to the above sanctions which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Business—
_Legal and Regulatory Proceedings.”_

**_We may incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents and representatives or be excluded_**
**_from contracting with public authorities for the actions of our employees._**

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation and business prospects.
Any contact by our directors, employees or agents with public administration organizations as well as with
private individuals, under certain circumstances, involves risks associated with, among others, fraud, bribery,
corruption and other fraudulent activities by our employees and related investigations. Furthermore, we are
exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents could commit IT related crimes, which may consist in
violating our IT systems or those of our competitors, unlawful access to banking data (including that of our
customers) and damages to IT systems and documents.

45


-----

Our employees and third party installers on EOLO’s behalf deliver services within buildings, for specific fixed
assets (i.e., telecommunications equipment) and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a result, we
may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized use of the
customer’s property, unauthorized entry or breach of security protocols, negligence or willful misconduct or
other tortious acts by our employees or people who have gained unauthorized access to premises through us.
Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for us. Accordingly, these claims could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are currently involved in the
Criminal Proceeding. See “—We are subject to Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal
_persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the_
_state, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.” Our CEO and other former and_
current managers have been investigated for (i) aggravated theft of unauthorized radio-frequencies
(ii) aggravated fraud against the Italian State; and (iii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this
third charge was dismissed by the court in November 2019). Although on January 25 2021, the Public Prosecutor
issued a motion to dismiss the allegations of aggravated theft and aggravated fraud against EOLO’s managers, on
February 15, 2021 Linkem S.p.A. filed an opposition to the request for dismissal. The offences of aggravated
theft and fraud against the Italian State are sanctioned with:

‰ Imprisonment from two to six years for aggravated theft and a fine from €206.00 to €1,594.00,
imprisonment from one to seven years for aggravated fraud a and fine from €309.00 to
€2,065.03;

‰ Ban measures: ban from contracting with the Italian government for a period up to five years;
and/or

‰ Disgorgement of the crime’s profits.

Although our legal counsel has advised us that the risk that the competent court will not authorize the dismissal
can be considered as remote given the whole elements under analysis and the current status of the proceeding,
our current managers (including our CEO) could be subject to the above sanctions, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Business—Legal
_and Regulatory Proceedings.” and “—We are subject to Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of_
_legal persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against_
_the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.”_

In addition, if the Criminal Proceeding will continue its course against EOLO’s managers, EOLO might be
summoned as entity liable for damages caused by the crime committed by such managers. In such case, should
such managers be convicted, EOLO might be required to compensate the damages, jointly with the convicted
natural persons.

Furthermore, a conviction of EOLO’s managers for the Criminal Proceeding may entail a risk on the possible
participation of EOLO to public tender processes. According to art. 80 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 50/2016
(Italian Code of Public Contracts), the final (i.e. non-appealable) conviction for certain crimes (including the
aggravated fraud against the Italian State) referring to the members of the board of directors, the holders of a
power of attorney and persons with powers of representation, direction and control generally, including technical
directors (including also persons whose office ended in the year before the publication of the tender notice)
represents an automatic cause of exclusion from public tendering procedures, while a non-final conviction or a
pending trial for the aforementioned crimes may represent a discretionary cause of exclusion from tendering
procedures to be evaluated on a case by case basis by each public contracting authority in charge of the tendering
procedures. In addition, a conviction of EOLO’s legal representatives to imprisonment for a time frame longer
than six months (as well as the application of security or precautionary measures on the same individuals) must
be disclosed to the MED and may lead to the termination of our General Authorizations. “—Our ability to obtain
_all licenses, permits, rights of use or other authorizations required to operate our business and/or expand our_
_network or any other required licenses, permits or other authorizations is subject to risks and uncertainties.”_

**_We are exposed to certain risks in respect of the development, expansion and maintenance of our FWA_**
**_networks._**

Our business depends in part upon the success of the expansion and management of our FWA network. The
build-out of our FWA network is subject to risks and uncertainties which could delay the introduction of services

46


-----

in some areas and increase the cost of network construction. We are seeking to increase our presence in the
residential ultra-broadband market in rural and suburban areas in Italy, including the southern regions, by
investing significant efforts and resources to expand our footprint and the density of our FWA network. See
“Business.” Such network expansion, including those in our development pipeline, require substantial capital
expenditure throughout the planning and construction phases and it may take an extended period of time before
the expanded parts of our FWA network become fully operational. During the planning and expansion process,
we are subject to a number of construction, financing, operating, regulatory and other risks beyond our control,
including, but not limited to:

‰ increases in capital and/or operating costs;

‰ changes in demand for our services;

‰ labor disputes and disputes with contractors and sub-contractors;

‰ inadequate engineering, project management, capacity or infrastructure, including as a result of
failure by third parties to fulfil their obligations relating to the provision of utilities and
transportation links that are necessary or desirable for the successful operation of a project;

‰ electricity and power interruptions due to electricity load-shedding and/or blackouts, and
energy shortages;

‰ regulatory regimes impacting our business;

‰ changes in foreign currency exchange rates (we purchase certain BTS equipment from
non-Italian suppliers with contracts denominated in U.S. dollar);

‰ adverse changes in export duties, including as a result of trade wars;

‰ failure to complete projects timely and/or according to specifications;

‰ failure to meet license obligations;

‰ adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;

‰ environmental regulations, including the need to perform feasibility studies and conduct
remedial activities;

‰ political, social and economic conditions;

‰ fraud, theft and malfeasance;

‰ accidents;

‰ terrorist action;

‰ changes in law, rules, regulations, governmental priorities and regulatory regimes; and

‰ difficulties in obtaining and/or maintaining project development permission or requisite
governmental licenses, permits or approvals.

Although we have not yet experienced significant delays in our build out and maintenance program resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be future impacts resulting from workforce shortages. Additionally, we
may experience supply chain disruption if suppliers go out of business, cannot access sufficient stock or
experience delays in receiving permits or permissions as the relevant authorities focus elsewhere.

The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our
current or future network expansion projects on schedule or within budget, if at all, and may prevent us from
achieving the projected revenues, internal rates of return or capacity associated with such projects. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to generate revenues or profits from our expansion projects that meet our
planned targets and objectives, or that such revenues will be sufficient to cover the associated construction and
development costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, and prospects.

-----

In addition, our assumptions associated with maintenance and continued upgrades of our networks (including
upgrading our network infrastructure from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth) may prove to be inaccurate. Our current
network capacity may not be sufficient for all future services we plan to offer, or we may need to accelerate
capital expenditure plans if demand would exceed our planning. If we fail to successfully maintain and upgrade
our networks, our services and products may be less attractive to new customers and we may lose existing
customers to our competitors, or we may become subject to additional financial strain due to unbudgeted
investments. In addition, our network upgrades may fail to generate a positive return on investment, which may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. If our
capital expenditures exceed our projections or our operating cash flow is lower than expected, we may be
required to seek additional financing for future maintenance and upgrades or scale back planned maintenance and
upgrade programs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition,
and prospects.

**_The Italian telecommunications industry is characterized by high levels of competition. If we are not able to_**
**_successfully compete, our financial performance and business prospects may be materially adversely affected._**

The telecommunications market in Italy is characterized by high levels of competition among fixed-line and
mobile telecommunications and broadband service providers. TIM, Fastweb, Vodafone, Iliad and Linkem are
currently our principal competitors. TIM and Fastweb have well-established positions in the Italian market, have
the advantage of long-standing relationships with the Italian customers and have a large spectrum capacity in the
White areas. TIM has recently publicly announced its plans to reach 1 million households with 5G FWA (mobile
broadband) technology. Fastweb benefits from Open Fibers’s FTTH/FWA platform in White areas. Linkem is a
pure-play FWA company operating in urban areas. Certain of our competitors also benefit from greater levels of
global advertising or stronger brand recognition than we do. In addition, we offer our excess capacity to other
operators (e.g., TIM and Wind) who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to migrate customers currently served
through non-performing technologies in our Target Addressable Market. As such our solutions are then sold
using our competitors’ brand, we could facilitate our competitors’ business increasing their ability to compete
with us. The level of penetration and the highly consolidated nature of the Italian telecommunications market
generally could result in continued pricing pressure and churn, and our competitiveness will depend in part on
our ability to introduce new technologies, convergent services and attractive bundled products at competitive
prices. If we are unable to successfully manage our subscriber turnover or otherwise lose subscribers, we may
face increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs and reduced revenues, profitability or lower cash flows.

If we are unable to win subscribers from our competitors and/or retain its existing subscribers, or if we fail to
launch compelling and innovative products and services at competitive prices, we could lose our subscribers and
the financial performance and business prospects for our business could be materially adversely affected.

**_We depend on third party telecommunications providers and other third parties over which we have no direct_**
**_control for the provision of certain of our telecommunications services._**

Our ability to grow our subscriber base depends in part on our ability to source adequate supplies of network
equipment, CPE, customer service providers and installers in a timely manner. Our main equipment suppliers
include Cambium and Intracom. Suppliers of network equipment have limited resources which may impact the
rapidity of our network expansion. In addition, our customer service is partially outsourced through a dedicated
call center. Customer assistance services help us build and maintain good relationships with our customers,
which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. We also outsource our CPE installation and
replacement to around 600 contractors and 1,500 technicians distributed across the country. In addition to our
direct sales channels, we also use a variety of third parties for the sales of our B2C and B2B services through
indirect sales channels. The outsourcing of services and functions exposes us to certain risks.

Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions
to our operations and could result in us incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty
increases pricing or if we were required to locate alternative service providers or insource previously outsourced
services. Our ability to renew our existing contracts with suppliers of products or services, or enter into new
contractual relationships, with these or other suppliers, upon the expiration of such contracts, either on
commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events,
which may be beyond our control. We will also face the risk that the third party providers will fail to deliver the
services that we require or that services will fail to meet required operating and quality standards. The occurrence
of any of these risks or a significant disruption in our supply of products and services from key sourcing partners
and other providers could create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer
relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and

48


-----

prospects. For example, if our contractual arrangements with Cambium and Intracom are terminated or no longer
offered on reasonable terms, we may not be able to find an alternative equipment supplier on a timely basis, or at
all. In addition, we have been supporting the creation of our community of installers providing them continuous
formation, assistance, supporting tools and applications and engagement activities and it could be extremely
difficult for us to replace them in a timely manner. Finally, our business might be affected by any disruption,
delay, defect, quality issues, capacity shortage, or other issues adversely affecting the service quality of the third
party provider, such as the recent chip shortage.

We also rely on our contracts with Open Fiber in order to provide ultra-broadband FTTH to certain of our
customers. If Open Fiber experiences unforeseen financial or operational issues, this could have a significant
impact on our ability to achieve its strategy, and could have a material impact on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

**_We are subject to extensive regulation and may in the future be adversely affected by regulatory measures_**
**_applicable to it._**

Internet operations are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in Italy. AGCOM and the MED together
regulate the Italian telecommunications market pursuant to a regulatory framework adopted at European level
and implemented in Italy in particular through Legislative Decree No 259 of August 1, 2003 and its amendments
and implementing regulatory acts.

A description of certain regulations applicable to our business and the markets in which we operate is set out in
“Regulation.” These regulations are, and any development of or modification to these regulations will be,
material to the business, financial condition, and results of our operations. Investors should read the “Regulation”
section to have a summary understanding the scope and extent of such regulations. These regulations cover,
without limitation, European and domestic regulations regarding licensing, access, numbering, portability,
competition, frequency allocation, license renewals and costs and arrangements pertaining to interconnection,
leased lines, radio equipment, as well as consumer protection, data protection and privacy. We must comply with
an extensive range of regulatory requirements in our operations and the provision of our services.

We are unable to predict the impact of any adopted, proposed or potential changes in the regulatory environment
in which we operate, which is subject to continuous review by AGCOM and the MED, or further changes in the
EU regulatory framework, or in laws, regulation or government policy or further activities of AGCOM and the
MED that could adversely affect our business and competitiveness. We may be adversely affected by certain
decisions of the regulators or interpretation of laws applicable to its services and offerings. In particular, our
ability to compete effectively in our existing or new markets could be adversely affected if regulators decide to
expand the restrictions and obligations to which we are subject or extend such restrictions and obligations to new
services and markets, or otherwise withdraw or adopt regulations. In addition, decisions by regulators and
competent bodies regarding the granting, amendment or renewal of licenses, to us or to third parties, could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by restrictions on our ability to maintain existing network_**
**_infrastructure or install new network infrastructure._**

The coverage of our FWA network depends in part on our ability to maintain existing BTS and to build up new
BTS for our network. Our BTS are generally built on land owned by third parties, the use of which is secured by
way of lease agreements. There can be no guarantee that these lease agreements will be extended or renegotiated
on commercially favorable terms upon the expiration of their respective terms, or that they will be extended at
all. If we are not able to renew our current lease agreements for BTS sites and/or to enter into new lease
agreements for suitable alternate BTS sites, this could have a negative impact on the coverage of our network.
Additionally, CPEs are installed on customer premises. Disputes with these customers or legal proceedings
involving their property may subject CPEs to encumbrances or cause them to be inaccessible, which could
adversely affect our ability to operate our network. Further, our inability to successfully and timely resolve such
disputes could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on key information technology systems, which may be vulnerable to damage, security breaches or_**
**_cyberattacks that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as well as our business, prospects,_**
**_financial condition, and/or results of operations._**

Information technology helps us efficiently and accurately provide services to our customers and monitor our
operations. While we seek to apply best practice policies and devote significant resources to network security and

49


-----

other security measures to protect our information technology and communications systems and data, these
security measures cannot provide absolute security. Despite existing security measures, certain of our wireless
infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer
viruses, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches.

An unexpected increase in volume on our network and systems could cause them to malfunction, such as in
periods of increased demand or unexpected circumstances that may reduce our ability to service our
infrastructure, or in a health crisis similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our repair performance and
installation of new projects can be impacted by the effects of increased absenteeism in the field workforce and
our expert teams in technology, or even by the imposition of a lockdown that prevents or hinders the
displacement and access of field maintenance teams to equipment stations. We may have our supply chain for
technological product inputs impacted by any delay in the manufacturing process of vendors in their countries of
origin, due to a new wave of COVID-19 that imposes a total lockdown.

The performance of our information technology systems may also be impacted by certain operating conditions in
the markets in which we operate, including lack of reliable power supply as well as general security conditions.
An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, or damage caused by other
means could potentially result in the interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers, our
inability to meet expected levels of service or data transmitted over our customers’ networks being compromised.
We cannot guarantee that our security and power backup measures will not be circumvented or fail, resulting in
customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers’ network availability, potentially
resulting in penalties for failure to meet targeted quality levels, as well as otherwise having an adverse effect on
our business, reputation, financial condition, and/or operational results. We may be required to spend significant
resources to protect against or recover from such threats. In addition, as we implement new information
technology systems, we cannot guarantee that our new security measures will be sufficient. If an actual or
perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures
could be harmed, and we could lose customers.

Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. Our employees or
external actors operating in any geography may commit these attacks. Any such events could result in legal
claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation,
negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

In addition, we may be exposed to data piracy or other data privacy and security breaches which could result in
the leakage and unauthorized dissemination of information about our Subscribers, including their names,
addresses, home phone numbers, passport details and individual tax numbers. In addition, the breach of security
of our data and illegal sale or other unauthorized release of our subscribers’ personal information could
materially adversely impact our reputation, prompt lawsuits against us by our subscribers, lead to violations of
data protection laws and adverse actions by the telecommunications regulators and other authorities, lead to a
loss in subscribers and hinder our ability to attract new subscribers. If severe customer data security breaches are
detected, the regulatory authority can sanction us, and such sanction can include suspension of operations for
some time period. Moreover, under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), beginning in
May 2018, breach of our data protection obligations may be subject to administrative fines of the greater of up to
€20.0 million or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover. In addition, we may be exposed to cyberattacks, which could result in equipment failures or disruptions in our operations. Finally, we may face in the
future consumer complaints for unsolicited marketing campaigns which also may result to significant fines and
prompt lawsuits. Our inability to operate our network as a result of such events may result in significant expense
or loss of market share. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property proprietary rights and prevent others from_**
**_making unauthorized use of such rights._**

The success of our business depends, inter alia, on our ability to protect and enforce our trade secrets, and other
intellectual property rights including through our ability to enforce contractual arrangements designed to protect
such intellectual property rights. Our trademark registrations include, inter alia, the signs “EOLO”, “EOLO
wave” and others. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may not be
deterred from misuse, theft or misappropriation of them, including trade secrets and information that we regard
as proprietary. For example, we developed EOLIA, a key software for design, operations, management and
monitoring but we have not obtained a patent for EOLIA and no patent application has been made. We have filed

50


-----

various applications for the registration of our intellectual property in Italy and in certain other jurisdictions in
which we operate. Our applications may not be granted, our existing protections may expire and we may fail to
obtain such protections in the future. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and
time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a
reasonable cost or in a timely manner.

Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming.
While we are not currently involved in any intellectual property disputes, attempts to enforce our rights against
third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against
us, or take unilateral steps to invalidate our intellectual property rights, which could result in a holding or official
action that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to protect our
proprietary rights (including trade secrets on our software and technologies), we may be at a competitive
disadvantage compared to others who have not incurred the additional expense, time and effort which may be
required to protect the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. Any of these events
could materially adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and prospects.

**_Our intellectual property, with particular reference to trade secrets, may not prevent competitors from_**
**_independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours. Our ability to protect our_**
**_intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations_**
**_governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. We may be unable to_**
**_attract and retain key personnel, directors, managers, employees and other individuals without whom we may_**
**_not be able to manage our business effectively._**

We depend on the availability and continued service of a relatively small number of key managers, employees
and other individuals, including our senior management. These key individuals are heavily involved in the daily
operations of our business and are, at the same time, required to make strategic decisions, ensure their
implementation and manage and supervise the execution of our business strategy. The loss of one or more of
these key individuals could significantly impede our financial plans, product development, network expansion,
marketing and other plans. Our future operating results depend, in a significant part, upon the continued
contributions of our existing management and our ability to expand our senior management team by adding
highly skilled new members, who may be difficult to identify and recruit. In particular, our Chairman’s and
CEO’s continued involvement in the strategic oversight of the Group is key for our continued development and
competitive position.

In addition, competition for qualified executives in the telecommunications industry in the markets in which we
operate is intense, and individuals with industry-specific experience are scarce. As a result, we may be required
to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain such professionals in the face of increasing opportunities in
the markets in which we operate. While we constantly seek to recruit and retain an adequate number of qualified
professionals in the telecommunications industry, we may not successfully be able to do so. Moreover,
integration of new management would require additional time and resources, which could adversely affect our
ability to successfully implement our strategy. If some of our senior executives or other key individuals cease
their employment or engagement with us, or if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel
across all levels our business or continue to successfully expand, train, manage and motivate our employee base,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

In particular, certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are currently
involved in the Criminal Proceeding. See “—We may incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees,
_agents and representatives or be excluded from contracting with public authorities for the actions of our_
_employees.” Although our legal counsel has advised us that the risk that the court will not authorize a dismissal_
of the charges against such managers is remote, our current managers (including our CEO) could be subject to
the above sanctions as a result of a guilty verdict and we could therefore lose key individuals for our business
who would lack of the applicable moral requirements to operate their functions, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Market demand for FWA services in Italy may not increase, limiting our ability to recoup the cost of its_**
**_investment in developing FWA technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and_**
**_results of operations_**

We seek to strengthen our market position by expanding our reach of FWA into White areas where there is an
absence of FTTH and an underperforming FTTC technology. Our ability to recoup our FWA-related
expenditures will depend largely upon the costs of developing such technology and the continued and increasing

51


-----

customer demand for this type of services. Although there have been signs of widespread demand for high-speed
internet services in recent years, the size of the market is still unknown and may fall short of industry
expectations and this technology may not prove more attractive to subscribers than other existing technologies
and services. If FWA-based services do not, or are slower than anticipated to, gain sufficiently broad commercial
acceptance in Italy, or if we derive a smaller percentage of our total revenues than expected, we may not be able
to adequately recoup our investment or profit from such investment.

Compared to the FTTH technology, FWA service often requires line-of-sight access between the subscriber and a
ground station. Obstructions from hills or trees prevent it from being installed in some locations. Storms can
sometimes adversely affect the quality of the service. These FWA features might limit the expansion of the FWA
technology as customers could, depending on factors such as relative performance and price, choose instead the
FTTH technology (if available) or mobile internet services.

In addition, over the past few years we have started to migrate our customers from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth.
Due to the physical characteristics of electromagnetic waves, the 28 GHz network design allows for tighter
tolerances compared to networks based on other carrier bandwidths. If we do not keep adopting a control and
validation process for the 28 GHz implementation, by investing in a dedicated measuring tool that ascertains the
correct tilt and azimuth of the panel, the quality of our service may be affected and customers could consider
other solutions. Moreover, a substantial portion of our FWA services operates in the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum,
which is used by a wide range of consumer devises and is becoming increasing crowded. If such 5GHz spectrum
usage continues to increase through the proliferation of consumer electronics and products competitive with ours,
the resultant higher levels of noise in the bands of operation our FWA services use could decrease the
effectiveness of our FWA services, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Our business
could be further harmed if currently unlicensed spectrum becomes licensed in Italy. We may be unable to obtain
licenses for such spectrum. Even if the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum remains unlicensed, existing and new
governmental regulations may require we make changes in our FWA services. For example, we may be required
limit our ability to use FWA technology in licensed or otherwise restricted spectrum. The operation of our FWA
services in a manner not in compliance with Italian law could result in fines, operational disruption, or harm to
our reputation.

In addition, our ability to recoup our FWA-related expenditures will depend largely upon implementing a
competitive pricing strategy that appeals to consumers. As a result, the costs to develop such technology, the
failure to recoup its expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or
results of operations.

**_Since our business is concentrated in Italy, our business, financial condition, results of operations and_**
**_liquidity may be adversely affected by disruptive political or economic events and economic uncertainty in_**
**_Italy._**

We currently operate exclusively in the Italian market and our success is therefore closely tied to general
economic, legal and political developments in Italy and cannot be offset by developments in other markets.
Accordingly, our results may be adversely impacted by negative economic, legal or political developments in
Italy, or by our failure to anticipate the needs and preferences of Italian subscribers in terms of our marketing,
services and investments. A downturn in the Italian economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
could affect spending generally as well as demand and pricing for our products and services, the creditworthiness
of our customers and other counterparties, the ability of other telecommunication companies to compete
effectively, and the availability and cost of debt financing. In September 2019, a coalition government composed
of the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was sworn in. Such coalition
government was formed following the 2018 general election, in which no party won an outright majority, which
resulted in a “hung” parliament and led to protracted negotiations to form a new government. These negotiations
were concluded with the formation of a coalition government, composed of the anti-establishment League and
Five Star Movement parties, which collapsed in August 2019. It is unclear how long the current technocratic
government will remain in office and whether it will be able to adequately address impediments to the country’s
growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the writedown of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. Continuation or further worsening of
these economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, some of our customers use our products and services as part of
their business operations, which often are affected by the state of the economy. As businesses face decreasing
volumes of activity and experience cash flow problems, the demand for our services and products could decrease.

**_Actual or perceived health risks or other problems relating to telecommunications transmission equipment_**
**_could lead to decreased internet usage, litigation or stricter regulation._**

Various reports have alleged that there may be health risks associated with the effects of electromagnetic signals
from antenna sites and from telecommunications devices. It cannot be assured that further medical research and
studies will not establish a link between electromagnetic signals or radio frequency emissions and these health
concerns.

The actual or perceived risk of telecommunications devices, press reports about risks or consumer litigation
relating to such risks could adversely affect the size or growth rate of our subscriber base. In addition, these
health concerns may cause the EU and Italian authorities to impose stricter regulations on the construction of
BTS or other telecommunications network infrastructure, which may hinder the completion or increase the cost
of network deployment and the commercial availability of new services. If actual or perceived health risks were
to result in consumer litigation or stricter regulation, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.

**_To the extent that we experience labor disputes or work stoppages, our business could be materially adversely_**
**_affected._**

The Italian Constitution provides that all employees of Italian companies have the right to set up and join trade
unions and to carry on union activities, including appointing workers’ representatives to negotiate with their
employer. The right to go on strike is provided for under Italian law.

There can be no assurance that future claims by employees will not have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, or results of operations. Notwithstanding any agreements that we may have with unions, we
cannot guarantee that our employees will not go on strike in the future. Any work stoppages resulting from
employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of customer service. We, along with the
other companies engaged in the telecommunications services business, from time to time negotiate with the
relevant unions the renewal of the collective labor agreements. Should the union make requests during the course
of negotiations with us that we refuses to accept, there is a risk that the union could call on its members to strike
to force us to give in to the union’s demands, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, from time to time, we have and may in the future, carry out collective dismissals. Such collective
dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to
pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims.

**_We may become party to disputes and legal, tax and regulatory proceedings._**

We are subject to risks relating to the legal, criminal, civil, tax, regulatory and competition proceedings to which
we are a party or in which we are otherwise involved or which could develop in the future, and certain of these
proceedings (or proceedings in which we may become involved), if adversely resolved, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Furthermore, our involvement in
legal, criminal regulatory and competition proceedings, even if we are not a party, may distract management or
harm our reputation. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome of any particular legal proceeding will be.
For a description of our existing material legal, criminal, regulatory and competition proceedings, see
“Business—Legal and Regulatory Proceedings” and “—We are subject to Italian legislation related to the
_“corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions for offenses (including_
_corruption, fraud against the state, corporate offenses and market abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.”_

**_We face various risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other health epidemics and outbreaks, which_**
**_may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of
COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and
market downturns, and restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines,
government-mandated actions, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, led to disruption and volatility in the
global and Italian capital markets and had a negative impact on global, regional and national economies and
disrupted supply chains and reduced international trade and business activity.

Although during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for streamed entertainment and online working and learning
have increased the demand for reliable and fast connectivity significantly, churn rates in the year ended
March 31, 2021 were higher than usual due to the one-off effect of the lockdown driven by unexpected network

53


-----

overload which resulted in more frequent technical issues and a lower quality of service delivered to customers.
If the pandemic continues for an extended period, it may also reduce demand from our post-paid clients for more
expensive plans or certain services or even lead to plan cancellations or increased delinquency. Protracted
restrictive measures could also lead to disruptions in our logistic chain, in our suppliers’ deliveries or in our
ability to deliver our products or to service our network on a timely basis, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work
effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, quarantines, facility closures,
ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely
impacted. Our repair performance and installation of new accesses/projects can be impacted by the effects of
increased absenteeism in the field workforce and in our expert teams, or even by the imposition of a lockdown by
that act as obstacle or hinders the displacement and access of field maintenance teams to equipment stations.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to
our ability to the credit risk of our customers (see “—Delayed payments or non-payments by our customers could
_adversely affect us”), our dependence third party telecommunications providers (“—We depend on third party_
_telecommunications providers and other third parties over which it has no direct control for the provision of_
_certain of its telecommunications services”)._

Our ability to receive payment for the products and services we sell depends on the continued creditworthiness of
our customers. We may experience a higher than normal level of delayed payments or non-payments by our
customers if their economic conditions are weakened, which could negatively impact our working capital as our
trade payables remain outstanding for a significant period of time. The receivables overdue provided for relate
predominately to penalties charged to customers terminating their contracts Should the Italian economy
experience economic volatility or tightening credit markets, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments
on a timely basis from our customers could increase. Further, a deterioration of economic conditions in Italy,
including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, could lead to financial difficulties or by our customers.
Accordingly, this could result in an increase in the allowance for doubtful receivables and cancellations, as well
as in a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could impact our liquidity and cash flow negatively.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand name could adversely affect_**
**_our business._**

Our brand name represents an important business asset. We rely on marketing to strengthen our brand name and
our marketing initiatives may prove to be ineffective. Any future negative perceptions of our brand, in respect of,
for example, product quality, price level of our products and services, effectiveness and timeliness of our
customer service, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operation and financial
condition. For example, a guilty verdict in the Criminal Proceeding could affect our reputation. Maintaining the
reputation of and the value associated with our brand name is central to the success of our business and there can
be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this objective. Substantial erosion in the reputation of or value
associated with our brand names could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in_**
**_our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or_**
**_our results of operations._**

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business, including coverage
for professional liability and transit policy. However, such insurance may not cover all risks associated with our
business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur
losses beyond these maximum limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. If this occurs, and we
incur liability, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been available
on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be
able to obtain coverage at current levels, and/or our premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies may
increase significantly on the policy coverage that we currently maintain. If insurance is not available at
economically acceptable premiums, there is a risk that our insurance coverage does not cover the full scope and
extent of claims against us or losses that we incur, including, but not limited to, claims for environmental or
industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution and product liability and business interruption.

54


-----

Furthermore, to discharge an uninsured claim or prior to receiving reimbursement of insurance proceeds, we may
need to incur further debt or divert capital from other planned expenditure. Costs associated with unanticipated
events in excess of our insurance coverage, or a failure to maintain such coverage could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

**_Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our business activities could adversely affect_**
**_our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Our operations and properties are subject to regulation by various government entities and agencies in connection
with obtaining and renewing various licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations, as well as ongoing
compliance with, among other things, telecommunications, environmental, health and safety, labor, building and
urban planning, personal data protection and consumer protection laws, regulations and standards. For example,
we may be subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including laws governing the hazardous
material content of some of the equipment used in our FWA services and laws relating to the recycling of
electrical and electronic equipment. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental laws could
result in the incurrence of fines or penalties and could adversely affect the demand for or sales of our FWA
services. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and interpretation of
applicable laws, regulations and standards, the issuance and renewal of licenses, permits, approvals and
authorizations and monitoring licensees’ compliance with the terms thereof. We may sometimes disagree with
the way legal provisions are interpreted or applied by regulators and we may, from time to time, challenge or
contest regulatory decisions in the course of our business, which may affect our relations with regulators.

The competent authorities have the right to, and frequently do, conduct periodic inspections of our operations and
properties throughout the year. Any such future inspections may result in the conclusion that we have violated
laws, decrees or regulations. We may be unable to refute any such conclusions or remedy the violations found.

Regulators have significant latitude in the administration and interpretation of telecommunications licenses and
laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the actions taken by these regulators in the administration and
interpretation of these licenses and laws, rules and regulations may be influenced by local political and economic
pressures. Regulatory regimes and decisions could also affect our customers and suppliers, which in turn could
adversely affect our business and prospects.

Increases in, or changes to, regulation could result in higher operational costs and decrease our ability to present
attractive offers to our customers and potential customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Decisions by regulators and new legislation could adversely affect
the pricing of, or adversely affect the revenue from, the services and products we offer, as well as the nature and
scope of the services we offer or may in the future wish to offer.

Decisions by regulators may include limiting our pricing flexibility, raising our costs (including by raising
licensing fees), limiting our access to additional resources which may at times be essential (such as spectrum,
conduit access rights and rights of way), reducing our wholesale or retail revenues or conferring greater pricing
flexibility on our competitors.

In addition, policies, legislation and regulations on taxation, customs and excise duties may change from time to
time. Any such policy changes, as well as inconsistencies in the interpretation of, and decisions relating to, tax
laws, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If we fail to comply with any of these requirements in a timely manner, we could be subject to fines, penalties,
litigation and enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition, and prospects.

**_If our advertising and promotional activities are not successful, our ability to market and sell our products or_**
**_develop new products may be harmed._**

Expanding our subscriber base is central to pursuing our business strategy, and in order we usually invest in
communication and marketing activities to launch and promote such new products. We must therefore manage
our advertising and marketing costs effectively in order to maintain satisfactory operating margins and return on
our marketing investment and convert customer awareness into actual product purchases. Our marketing efforts
might not generate the expected degree of brand recognition, nor promote growth in the number of customers or
expansion of sales volume that we expect, thus resulting in a lower return on our marketing investment, lower
sales of our products and services and more limited growth and possibility to invest in new products’
development in the future.

**_We are subject to competition and antitrust laws._**

The Italian telecommunications market is characterized by a few major operators. Due to this concentration and
competitive landscape and market practices such as bundling and converged offers, as well as the barriers to new
entrants posed by the capital costs of establishing a new network, Italian and EU antitrust regulators are actively
interested in our industry. As a result, transactions, arrangements, partnerships or joint ventures between or
among major market participants may attract regulatory scrutiny or action, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Claims of third parties that we infringe their intellectual property could significantly harm our financial_**
**_condition, and defending intellectual property claims may be expensive and could divert valuable company_**
**_resources_**

We operate in an industry characterized by frequent disputes over intellectual property. As the number of
convergent product offerings and overlapping product functions increase, the possibility of intellectual property
infringement claims against us will correspondingly increase. Any such claims or lawsuits, whether with or
without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, could cause us to cease offering or licensing
services and products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or could require us to develop
non-infringing products or services, if feasible, which could divert the attention and resources of technical and
management personnel. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation related to
infringement claims against us. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in being required to
pay significant damages, cease the development or sale of certain products and services that incorporate the
challenged intellectual property, obtain licenses from the holders of such intellectual property which may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms, or otherwise redesign those products to avoid infringing upon
others’ intellectual property rights, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

**_Additional tax expense or additional tax exposure may affect our future profitability._**

We are subject to various taxes, including corporate income tax (“IRES”), regional tax on productive activities
(“IRAP”) and related surcharges, value added tax (“VAT”), tax on financial activities, tax on financial
transactions, stamp duty and substitutive taxes. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may
be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. In addition, these assumptions
include assessments of our future earnings that may impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. Our future
results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate, changes in our overall
profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in
the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax
returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be
analyzed in Italy. Significant changes to the corporate tax system in Italy and any country in which we operate, or
may operate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum is based on estimates and assumptions_**
**_in respect of certain adjustments which are subject to significant uncertainties._**

Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum has not been subject to audit or review by
our auditors, consultants or experts and the estimates and assumptions that have been used to calculate such
Non-IFRS Measure are subject to significant uncertainties. While we gained many new subscribers during the
COVID-19 period due to increased demand for connectivity, we cannot be certain as to whether our historical
churn rate will be maintained. For example, our Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA includes a run-rate impact which is
calculated as the EBITDA that EOLO would have generated during the twelve months ended June 30, 2021
period if subscribers as of June 30, 2021 had been subscribers for the entire period, applying the Blended ARPU
for the twelve months period to such subscriber base. Our Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is therefore presented for
informational purposes only and does not purport to present the cash generated by our new subscriber base nor
does it purport to project cash generation for any future period. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize
some or all of the expected benefits. Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA and the underlying calculations were not
prepared with a view to compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines published by any
other regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, and therefore have not been, and cannot be, audited,
reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information does not constitute a measure of
financial performance under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider
any of this information as an alternative to net profit/(loss) or any other performance measure derived in
accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. If any of our assumptions or
estimates prove to be materially incorrect, our cash flows may suffer.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion of the_**
**_Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks._**

The Issuer does not currently control the Target. The Issuer will not obtain control of the Target until completion
of the Acquisition. The Sellers may not operate the business of the Target during the interim period in the same
way that we would. The information contained in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from industry
publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources and, in the case of historical
information relating to the Target, it has been provided to us by the Sellers as well as members of management of
the Target, and we have relied on such information supplied to us in its preparation. Furthermore, the
Transactions themselves have required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from
management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the business. Likewise, other employees may
be uncomfortable with the Transactions or feel otherwise affected by them, which could have an impact on work
quality and retention. In addition, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target will not be subject to the
covenants described in “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the
Target will not take actions that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had such covenants been
applicable, including paying dividends, incurring debt or making investments. Holders of the Notes will not be
able to rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial condition of
the Target, the terms of the Acquisition or the Refinancing.

Finally, the continuing effects of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions may impact the consummation of the
Acquisition and may result in certain closing-related activities that would otherwise be routine, such as the
notarization of certain documents and the obtainment of original signatures, becoming more complex or timeconsuming.

**_If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be_**
**_required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes. In_**
**_addition, the Issuer might not have sufficient funds to pay all of the amounts due to the holders of the Notes in_**
**_the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer and will be
controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes,
respectively, pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of the control of the Issuer
and the Target. Completion of the Acquisition is one of the conditions to the release of the proceeds from escrow.
If the Acquisition is not consummated on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or in the event of certain other
events that trigger escrow termination (and, if requested by the Issuer, the holders of a majority of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes do not consent to a waiver of such conditions or an extension of the
Escrow Longstop Date), the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption, as described in
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and you may not obtain the
return you expect to receive on the Notes. The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds from
the Offering and will not be sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption price, which is equal to the
aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of Special Mandatory Redemption. In addition, negative interest is
expected to accrue on the gross proceeds from the Offering deposited in the Escrow Account. Given that, the
escrow funds would be insufficient to pay the amounts to the holders of the Notes in case of a Special Mandatory
Redemption, as well as any negative interest accruing on the sums deposited in the Escrow Account, the Issuer
will be required to obtain the funds to cover any such shortfall from its direct shareholder, HoldCo, given that the
Issuer is, and prior to the consummation of the Acquisition will continue to be, a holding company with no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations or material assets. There can be no assurance
that HoldCo will have sufficient funds available to fund such shortfall.

**_The Acquisition will entitle certain customers and certain other business partners of the Target to terminate_**
**_their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target,
including agreements with customers and suppliers and certain grants and subsidized financings. On the
Acquisition Closing Date, these counterparties could become entitled to terminate such agreements. Some of
these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect on the revenues
and business of the Target. In particular, with reference to the grants and subsidized financings, the Target is
expected to deliver all notices that may be required or recommended to be delivered in order to maintain such

57


-----

arrangements following completion of the Acquisition, including (to the extent applicable) obtaining the
applicable consent from the relevant authority in case of changes in the legal structure of the Target.

In the event of termination of any material contract as a result of the Transactions, there can be no assurance that
the Target would be able to successfully replace the products or services that were provided under the relevant
contract at attractive prices or at all. Likewise, if the Target were required to amend any such contract we can
provide no assurance that the terms of such amendment will not be materially adverse to the Group or will not
otherwise impact the Group’s business or operations. Accordingly, any termination or amendment of a
significant contract as a result of the change of control could materially or adversely affect our business and the
ability to provide services to our customers. It is also possible that material supply contracts could be terminated
or amended in other circumstances. If the Group fails to become a party to a material contract that historically
has formed part of the Target’s business or any such arrangement is terminated, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The Target may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated._**

The Target may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations in connection with the Acquisition. We may learn of additional information about the
Target that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of the Target to
suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension
liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we
underestimated. In conducting our due diligence, we have been required to rely on resources available to us,
including public information and information provided by the Sellers and third-party advisers. In addition, our
due diligence provided for materiality thresholds, a limited scope and a restricted perimeter. There can be no
assurance that the due diligence we have undertaken has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or
helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of
information provided during the due diligence exercise or that such information was accurate and remained
accurate through the conclusion of the due diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective.
If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the Acquisition, the Target
may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the Target
or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialization of certain risks, which may or may not be
identified during due diligence, occur, it may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent
contractual and statutory liability to various parties.

Any of these events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the business of the
Target, or on the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the_**
**_Sellers have provided to the Issuer under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain customary representations and warranties in the
Acquisition Agreement related to their shares, the Target and the Target’s business. Nonetheless, third-parties
could seek to hold the Issuer responsible for any of the liabilities the Sellers have agreed to retain, and the Issuer
may not be able to enforce any claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations and
warranties. The Sellers’ liability under the Acquisition Agreement is very limited. Moreover, even if the Issuer is
able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and warranties, the Issuer
may temporarily be required to bear these losses itself.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.
However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may be waived at any time by
the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes. Any amendment made to the Acquisition
Agreement may be materially adverse to holders of the Notes, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on the
return holders of the Notes expect to receive on the Notes.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial
condition of the Issuer, or the terms of the Acquisition or the financing thereof, between the closing of the
Offering and the Acquisition Closing Date, may have an impact on the creditworthiness of the Issuer, and you
will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes._**

After completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and will have substantial debt service
obligations. As of June 30, 2021, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party
financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €438.3 million, including €375.0 million representing the
aggregate principal amount of Notes. In addition, we will have €125.0 million of available revolving credit under
our Revolving Credit Facility, which we expect to be undrawn on the Acquisition Closing Date. We anticipate
that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

‰ making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

‰ increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

‰ requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

‰ restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

‰ limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

‰ negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; and

‰ limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and
increasing the cost of any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture limit our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, such limitations are subject to exceptions and qualifications and the incurrence of additional
indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are
beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we
might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure
you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or satisfactory terms, if at all, or
would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post-_**
**_Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the Target to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will not have any subsidiaries and will have no assets other than
the Escrow Account into which the proceeds of the Offering will be deposited and which will be charged in favor
of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer will be a
holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than,
following the Acquisition Closing Date, the shares it will hold in the Target and its receivables under the Funding
Loan. The Issuer will in part be, dependent upon the cash flows from the Target and any of its future operating
subsidiaries and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo will in part be, dependent upon the cash
flows from any of its future operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, principal repayments under the
Funding Loan or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the

59


-----

Notes. See “—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the Post-Completion
_Merger (if it occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.” The amounts of_
dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will in part depend, on the profitability and cash flows of the
Target and any of its future operating subsidiaries and, following the Post-Completion Merger, the amounts of
dividends and distributions available to MergerCo will in part depend, on the profitability and cash flows of any
of its future subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or
otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable. More generally, the
Issuer’s or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s, subsidiaries (if any) may not be able to, or may
not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or to
MergerCo, as applicable, which could adversely affect the Issuer’s (or, following the Post-Completion Merger,
MergerCo’s) ability to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including payments in respect of the Notes.

In particular, various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of
the Target and any of its future subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer and, following the Post-Completion
Merger, to MergerCo. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable laws
may also limit the amounts that some of our future subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Target and its
future subsidiaries or, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s future subsidiaries to pay dividends to
the Issuer or to MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves
available to each of them and the ability to pay their debt when due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the
Funding Loan is currently expected to be approximately €146.1 million, which is significantly lower than the
aggregate principal amounts of the Notes, and we expect the Funding Loan to yield interest broadly in line with
the interest accruing under the Notes. Accordingly, prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the ability of the Issuer
to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Target and its future subsidiaries to
pay dividends to it, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax
perspective. Following the Post- Completion Merger the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo.

Prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Target will have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to
the Notes, and, accordingly, the Issuer will rely on its ability to pay dividends in order to be able to service the
Notes. While the Indenture limits the ability of the Target to incur consensual restrictions on its ability to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and
exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We may borrow up to
€125.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (subject to agreed security principles), which will be secured
by the same collateral as the Collateral for the Notes, and the Indenture also permits the incurrence of additional
debt. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of
indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral
or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes, and any such indebtedness could
mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions is substantial. If additional debt is incurred, the related risks that we now face would increase. In
addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants which impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

‰ incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

‰ make certain restricted payments and investments;

‰ transfer or sell assets;

60


-----

‰ enter into transactions with affiliates;

‰ create or incur certain liens;

‰ make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

‰ issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

‰ create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

‰ take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral;

‰ merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

‰ pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to operate our_
business, to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities
that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants
while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Revolving_
Credit Facility Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the availability of the Revolving
Credit Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default, event of default and/or acceleration action
under the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of acceleration of
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the
Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our
subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if
we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to
secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit
Facility and our obligations under the Notes, or to refinance our debt and to fund our ongoing operations or
expansion plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is
subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are
beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit
Facility. At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility (which is six months prior to the maturity of the Notes),
the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if
we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to
fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

‰ sell assets;

61


-----

‰ obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

‰ restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. If
this is the case, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future debt may limit,
our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial
position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose
of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would
be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our
obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in:

‰ our debt holders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;

‰ the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their
commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and

‰ our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your
investment in the Notes.

**_The Revolving Credit Facility and any future variable interest rate debt we incur in the future will bear_**
**_interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, a portion of our debt will bear interest at a variable rate, and we will be
exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. The Revolving Credit Facility will bear a variable rate based
on the EURIBOR, the Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) or (as applicable) the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), in each case plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in
the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for
capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement does not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of this rate,
there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements, that hedges might not be available for the full amount or term of the borrowings, that
break clauses might be required or that hedges will limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from
favorable movements in interest rates. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest
expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of
LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of
representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark rates (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement
indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, in
respect of some currencies and tenors, and after certain later dates for other currencies and tenors. This proposed
elimination of the LIBOR benchmark and possible future announcements in respect of any other benchmark,

62


-----

changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies
could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an
adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, including the need to adopt a
replacement benchmark, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Notes).
Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged
increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest.

In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt
performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had
not developed.

If we determine that EURIBOR or LIBOR have been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or
the agent (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the
manner as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties_**
**_fall into bankruptcy._**

We may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates,
including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also enter currency hedging arrangements
in respect of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility. Under any such agreements, we would be
exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we
have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event
that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make
termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral**

**_Prior to completion of the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does_**
**_not occur within 18 months from the Acquisition Closing Date, prior to the granting of the Guarantee by the_**
**_Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each_**
**_of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Target. After the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and_**
**_subject to the limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future_**
**_indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target. After the Post-_**
**_Completion Merger, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or_**
**_obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo._**

Prior to completion of the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not
occur on or prior to the date falling 18 months from the Acquisition Closing Date, prior to the granting of the
Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Target. After the granting of the Guarantee by the
Target (and subject to the limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or
future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target. After the PostCompletion Merger, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade
creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer or MergerCo, as
applicable, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer or MergerCo, as
applicable, and the Guarantors of the Notes (including, if the Target guarantees the Notes after the Cut-Off Date,
the Guarantee by the Target). Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer or
MergerCo, as applicable, becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up
other than as part of a solvent transaction:

‰ the creditors of the Issuer and MergerCo, as applicable, and any Guarantors (if any), including
the holders of the Notes, will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor
subsidiary; and

‰ creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal
of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer and MergerCo, as applicable, or any
Guarantors (if any), as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive
any distributions from such subsidiary.

63


-----

As such, the Notes and any Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors,
trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay
amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend,
distribution, loan or otherwise. As such, the claims of creditors of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings
of the subsidiary over the claims of the creditors of the Issuer, including claims by the holders of the Notes.

As of June 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Target would have had €105.1 million of
third-party debt outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes until the PostCompletion Merger.

In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit the Issuer, the Target and any future
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the
Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any limitation on the
amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables in the ordinary course of business that may be
incurred by non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

Moreover, any future notes guarantees would be subject to the significant limitations described under
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral and certain insolvency law
_considerations” and, accordingly, the Notes would be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any_
Guarantors to the extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or
secured by such Guarantors.

**_We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all._**

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any
relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with the Target, with
MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing Date. The PostCompletion Merger will be undertaken pursuant to the provisions of Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code. In
order to complete the Post-Completion Merger, there are various steps that we must take, including the
preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the Post-Completion Merger
(relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing
the sustainability of debt at the level of MergerCo. Our estimation of the timing required to complete the PostCompletion Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involves
acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is
required to be appointed by the court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the
Post-Completion Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
independent expert will release its report or that the other steps required for the Post-Completion Merger will be
taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, the Post-Completion Merger can only be
implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of
the resolutions approving the Post-Completion Merger. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the
companies involved in the Post-Completion Merger are entitled to challenge the Post-Completion Merger. See
also “—The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion of the
_Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.” In the event we are unable to_
consummate the Post-Completion Merger, Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer. See also “—Risks
_Related to Our Capital Structure—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of_
_its own and prior to the Post-Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the Target to be able to_
_make payments on the Notes.”_

As a result of the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger, in the event that the Target is the successor
company resulting from the Post-Completion Merger, the obligations of the Issuer of the Notes will be assumed
by MergerCo pursuant to the Indenture, and (ii) certain of the security under the Completion Collateral and the
Post-Completion Collateral will cease to exist. In the event we are unable to consummate the Post-Completion
Merger, the Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer.

Following the Post-Completion Merger, the Target may not be the surviving entity. If the Post-Completion
Merger is ultimately structured such that the Issuer is the surviving entity, or if there is a new resulting entity,
then the Target will be required to transfer licenses and permits relating to the conduct of its business operations
to the new entity resulting from the Post-Completion Merger, which in certain circumstances may result in the
termination of licenses or contracts or the loss of key customers. There is no assurance that in such event, the

64


-----

Target will be able to transfer its business licenses or permits in a timely manner, or at all, or that our business
may not be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such Guarantee within the time
period specified, and in any event such Guarantee would be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and_**
**_the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee and the Collateral._**

The Issuer (and following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo) and the Target are or will be incorporated
and organized under the laws of Italy. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against, and/or any
Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such person will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer
(and following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo) or the relevant Guarantor or the security provider, as the
case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
financial assistance, transactions under value, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, preservation of share
capital, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences, thin capitalization or similar laws as well as regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantee and
Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed or secured by a Guarantor or security provider under applicable law, to the extent that the
granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate
interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security
provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance,
liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/ or would cause the
directors of such Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal
liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in
the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of
the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain
defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the
Guarantee designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. As a
result, a guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the
amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor or creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of
a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee on any of the above
grounds and the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent
that agreed limitations on the Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would to that extent be structurally
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future
notes guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

**_The Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. The
obligations of each Guarantor, the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee and the obligations of the grantor of
security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the security interests will be limited under the
Indenture to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor or provided by the grantor of
security under the applicable laws of Italy, which has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will
not result in violations of laws related to, among others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation,
financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the relevant Guarantor to be deemed insolvent
under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of
such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee. In
particular, enforcement of any Guarantee or security interest against the relevant Guarantor or pledgor would be
subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the
terms of the relevant Guarantee or pledges of security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements

65


-----

applicable to the relevant Guarantors or pledgors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent
conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Guarantee or of a
pledgor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other obligations
and the law applicable to it.

In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, as regards to the
Target, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests (if any) granted by the Target will only guarantee and secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not
exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans
(including the Funding Loan) (or other financial support in any form, not including equity contributions)
advanced from time to time to the Target (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article
2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the
Acquisition Closing Date, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its
guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the
enforcement of any security interests (if any) granted by the Target; provided that the Target shall be fully
entitled to exercise any rights of set-off, recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) or other
similar rights it may have by reason of any payment made by it under its Guarantee in respect of any
obligations owed by the Issuer, against the payment obligations of the Target under any relevant
intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support received by the Target,
provided that the liability of the Target under its Guarantee shall not exceed the aggregate amount of any
such intercompany loans and/or documentary credits and/or any other financial support following the
exercise of any such set-off rights;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Target, also in accordance with article 1938 of the
Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in
“Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment,
prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate
amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the
Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target will be at
any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the
principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of the Target under its
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the
Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set
forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively;
and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest (if any) by the Target does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not)
extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or
payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the Target and,
therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or
2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might
be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds
from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of

66


-----

the share capital of the Target. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests (if any) granted by the Target
be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance,
including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security
interests (if any) could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent
such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358
and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the Target will be deemed to have no liability
thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor
and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional
limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security
documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above
corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to
pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably
concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security
provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari
passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice
versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the Guarantees and
the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/
or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor
Agreement-the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto
shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents
will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/
or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the
relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a
Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must
be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and
expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant notes guarantee and security. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws apply to the Guarantee.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct
that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for
the benefit of that Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court
found that:

‰ the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in
certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Guarantee has the effect of giving a
creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when
the relevant Guarantee was given;

‰ the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became

67


-----

undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it
would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

‰ the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or
not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or

‰ the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or the
bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, may contest the validity
and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned
grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be
limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in
part, or to the extent such limitations on the Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor, including trade payables of such
Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or notes guarantees may be subject to
similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency
trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed
to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery
than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within
a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

**_The principal amount of the Funding Loan may be less than anticipated as a result of prepayments of certain_**
**_indebtedness of the Target prior to the Acquisition Closing Date._**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will enter into the Funding Loan, a portion of the proceeds of which
will be used by the Target (together with certain cash available on the Target’s balance sheet) to repay in full and
cancel the Refinanced Target Indebtedness. The principal amount of the Funding Loan is currently expected to be
€146.1 million, which is significantly less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.
Repayments prior to the Acquisition Closing Date of amounts due in respect of the Refinanced Target
Indebtedness would result in a reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan entered into on the
Acquisition Closing Date. We cannot assure you that these amounts will not be reduced by additional payments
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, which would cause a corresponding reduction in the principal amount of
the Funding Loan. The intercompany receivables arising under the Funding Loan will constitute part of the PostCompletion Collateral. Prior to completion of the Post-Completion Merger, repayments of the Funding Loan
prior to the maturity date of the Notes would result in a reduction in the liability owed by the Target to the Issuer
and any reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan would reduce the value of such receivable and the
Post-Completion Collateral and, if the Target guarantees after the Cut-Off Date, the value of the Guarantee by the
Target. Any reduction in the principal amount of the Funding Loan could also adversely affect the ability of the
Issuer to make payments under the Notes if the Issuer is otherwise unable to cause its subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make loans or other distributions to it. The Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer
or the Target to amend the Funding Loan documentation. See also “—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—
_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post-_
_Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the Target to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_
The security interests in the Funding Loan will cease to exist automatically upon completion of the PostCompletion Merger.

**_The Issuer, HoldCo and any other provider of Collateral will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, HoldCo and any other Collateral providers,
as applicable, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and
dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration
event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, HoldCo and any other Collateral providers, as

68


-----

applicable, may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral,
which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an
enforcement of the liens on the Collateral.

**_Upon issuance on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be secured by the Escrow Charge, and on the Acquisition_**
**_Closing Date, the Notes will only be secured by the Completion Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer, will not be guaranteed and will only be
secured, subject to certain perfection requirements, by the Escrowed Property. On the Acquisition Closing Date,
the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by the Completion Collateral and, within 20
Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the PostCompletion Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” There can be no assurance, however, that we
will be successful in procuring such liens within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in
an “event of default” under the Indenture. Once granted, the security interests over the Collateral will be limited
to the same extent as those under the Revolving Credit Facility and otherwise as set forth under “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the_
_Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant._

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future_**
**_indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a_**
**_“super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority_**
**_to the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over amounts and other
recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions towards discharging certain super senior obligations
(including, among others, those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and
future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts towards
discharging the Notes. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of any Collateral will, after all
obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata to the repayment of all
obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks pari passu with
the Notes and is permitted to be incurred and secured by such Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”
Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have
priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of
the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of Italy. Adverse developments in these laws or
regulations, or any change in position or interpretation by the relevant Italian tax authority regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make
payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the tax authorities in Italy may disagree with the
positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax, including withholding tax, treatment or
characterization of our past, current and future indebtedness, including the Notes, and future intercompany loans
and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or through
reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of our various
financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If the Italian tax
authorities were to successfully challenge the tax, including withholding tax, treatment or characterization of any
of our transactions, it could result in higher taxes to be paid and the application of significant penalties and
interest that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or
on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and
restated, “Article 96”) sets forth limitations to interest deductibility for corporate income tax purposes. Article 96

69


-----

allows for the full deductibility of interest expenses incurred by a company in a given tax year only up to the
amount of the interest income of the same tax year plus interest income carried forward from previous tax years.
Any excess of interest income of a given tax year can be carried forward without limitation. Interest expenses in
excess of interest income (of the relevant tax year and of the previous ones) are deductible for corporate income
tax purposes up to a threshold that is 30% of the EBITDA of an Italian tax resident company (i.e., risultato
_operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica, “ROL”) as recorded in such company’s profit and loss account and_
adjusted according to domestic corporate income tax rules (the “Excess”). The unused ROL is carried forward,
increasing the amount of yearly ROL, for the subsequent five tax years. The Excess can be carried forward to the
subsequent tax years and deducted accordingly, provided, and to the extent, that, in such tax years, the amount of
yearly interest expenses that exceed interest income is lower than 30% of the available ROL (including the ROL
carried forward from previous tax years). In the case of a tax group, interest expenses not deducted by a
participant in the tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax group level, within the limit of the
excess of ROL of the other participants in the tax group. Article 96 provides special rules for certain entities
active in the insurance and finance sector.

Italian Legislative Decree no. 142 of November 29, 2018, enacting the EU anti-tax avoidance package was
published in the Italian official gazette on December 28, 2018. The Italian ATAD Decree transposes EU
Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD 1)—as amended by EU Directive 2017/952 (ATAD 2)—into the Italian legal
system, providing rules against the erosion of taxable bases in the internal market and the shifting of profits out
of the Italian market. Such rules are aimed at tackling “double deduction” or “deduction without inclusion”
(deduction of a negative income component in one country without any taxation in the other country) due to a
different characterization of financial instruments, payments, entities, and permanent establishments in various
countries. The rules apply to mismatches occurring between taxpayers considered to be associated enterprises or
arising in the context of a structured arrangement between two non-associated taxpayers.

The Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions with respect
to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30,
2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E (“Circular Letter”) clarifying, as a common
principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in leveraged buy-out transactions are generally deductible for
IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 and excluding cases of reinvestment (also
partial) by the seller(s). In case an acquisition is—or is considered as—entered into by one or more entities that
are related parties to the seller(s), the deduction of interest expenses is likely to be challenged by the tax
authorities based on anti-abuse provisions, unless non marginal business reasons exist for the debt-financed
acquisition.

Also, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to
challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used,
in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing
transaction appear less favorable than those of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such
circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does
not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as
such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law).

Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to
make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle and/or to make an acquisition under the anti-abuse
provisions, we may be unable to deduct our interest expenses and/or be subject to significant penalties or other
consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on
our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

If the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to carry out the
Refinancing under the “business purpose” principle or the “abuse of law” provisions, we or another entity of the
Group may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses or be subject to significant penalties and interest for late
payment of taxes or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and
results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other
indebtedness.

Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future
limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense
arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, or (iii) the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements
relating to the deductibility of interest expense, or (iv) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax
authorities of Italian tax law, may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an
adverse impact on our financial condition.

**_Payments in respect of the Notes may in certain circumstances be made subject to withholding or deduction of_**
**_tax for which Holders of the Notes may not receive additional amounts._**

We are organized under the laws of Italy and are resident in Italy for tax purposes and therefore payments of
principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain or payment on the Notes, may be
subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by us or on our behalf in respect of the Notes will
be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is
required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions and limitations, we must pay such Additional
Amounts as will result in the holders of the Notes receiving the net amounts as they would have received in
respect of such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required.

We will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes under certain circumstances,
including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 and any
related implementing regulation, except, the case of Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, where the procedures
required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied
with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or their agents. In such circumstances where we would
not be liable to pay Additional Amounts, investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net
proceeds of their investment in the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, imposta sostitutiva will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or
Decree No. 461 where the Notes are listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility upon issuance
date and a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory which allows for a satisfactory
exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities as contained in the White List, and such holder complies
with certain certification requirements, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of
the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including
any change in the White List. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**_There can be no assurance that the procedural requirements provided by Decree No. 239 will be met by the_**
**_relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The regime provided by Decree No. 239 and in particular the exemption from withholding tax in principle
granted to holders of the Notes—who are the beneficial owners of the Notes (or, if the holders are institutional
investors not subject to tax, even if they are not the beneficial owners of the Notes) and are resident in countries
or territories included in the White List—applies if certain procedural requirements are met. No assurance can be
given that all non-Italian resident investors will be eligible for the withholding tax exemption if the relevant
foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities in accordance
with the procedural requirements. Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian withholding tax may
apply on the payments made on the Notes to foreign investors resident in countries or territories included in the
White List. In such event, the Issuer will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to such
withholding tax, unless such procedural requirements have not been complied with due solely to the actions or
omissions of the Issuer or its agents.

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the EU financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the “Participating Member States”). On December 8,
2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal is
still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and Financial
Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of the
Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a reshaped
EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and, if introduced in its
current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain
circumstances. Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons
both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the
Notes provided that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating
Member State and that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating
Member State which is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another
person, or acting in the name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be,
“established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting

71


-----

with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject
to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to
negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the
timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or other
Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were
adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes
may be diminished. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of
the EU FTT associated with purchasing and disposing of the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes are secured on a first ranking basis with security interests over the Collateral that
also secure our obligations with respect to the Super Senior Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the
Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action.

The Security Agent may refrain from taking enforcement action unless instructed by the Instructing Group (as
defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) for the purpose of
enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of the Notes—Security.”_

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under
the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In
addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a
result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the liens over any
other assets of such entities securing the Notes may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer in the
event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for_**
**_the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Escrowed Property (prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date) or the relevant Collateral (following the Acquisition Closing Date), as applicable. See
“Description of the Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer
and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property
and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are
accelerated, the Notes thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally
with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any
property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are
secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims
of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the
rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional notes guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other
indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are
subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the agreed security principles. The agreed security
principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or notes
guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of such agreed security principles may result in, among other
things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a
particular type or class of assets. Pursuant to the agreed security principles, Collateral will be limited to security
over the shares of the Issuer, any future Guarantors and any member of the Group which is incorporated in Italy

72


-----

which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and
subject to certain adjustments) representing more than 5% of the EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) of the Group (“Material Company”), but without prejudice to the granting of the
Completion Collateral. Accordingly, such agreed security principles may affect the value of the security or notes
guarantees provided by the Issuer and any Guarantors.

In particular, even though the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same security
interests and Guarantors’ package, this may not be the case and circumstances may arise in the future in which
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or notes guarantees
which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the
agreed security principles and, ultimately, applicable financial assistance and corporate benefit rules.
Accordingly, in such circumstances, holders of the Notes would have no direct claim for payment against any
such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral.

**_There can be no assurance that the listing of the Notes will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree No. 239._**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that
the listing of the Notes on the Exchange will be granted in a timely manner or at all or that, once granted, will be
maintained. Additionally, the Issuer makes no representation that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement
under Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the exemption from the requirement to
apply withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among other things, the listing requirement
of the aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their issuance to
benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding
tax. Hence, according to a stringent interpretation of this circular, the Notes may not be eligible to benefit from
such provisions if the listing of the Notes is not effective as of the Issue Date. In the event that the Notes are not
listed or that such listing requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest, premium and other income with
respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax (ritenuta a titolo di imposta o acconto), currently at a
rate of 26% and, subject to certain exceptions under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we would
be required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes such that holders receive a net
amount that is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. We
cannot assure you that the Italian tax authorities will not interpret the applicable legislation as requiring that the
listing be effective at closing (upon issuance of the Notes) and we cannot assure you that the listing can be
achieved by the Issue Date. However, we intend to achieve the required listing of the Notes on the Issue Date by
obtaining a listing on the Exchange. The imposition of withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes
and the resulting obligation to pay, subject to certain exemptions, additional amounts to holders of the Notes
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Collateral is limited to certain specific assets, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets
underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the
security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the
extent of the Collateral is limited, including by virtue of the fact that no assets located in, and no shares of any
subsidiary incorporated in, any jurisdiction other than Italy will constitute part of the Collateral, and any
subsidiary incorporated in any jurisdiction other than Italy shall not provide any guarantee or security in favor of
the Notes. In accordance with the agreed security principles, notes guarantees and/or security shall only be
granted by certain entities. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer, the
Target and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the
Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the
amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other
things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale,
the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located
and the availability of buyers.

73


-----

The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide
for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to
other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable
or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the
transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to
hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security
Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in
certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to (or different from)
those that has been required to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition, or might otherwise be challenged. Such
consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may
be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly
decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not
be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our
subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the
obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining
assets in the pledged entity.

As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of
the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim
against the Issuer’s remaining assets.

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on
the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens,
including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or
third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the
proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In particular by operation of the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, security interests in the Collateral may be released if a lien is granted on the Collateral
in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien is a Permitted Lien (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”). Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture,_
holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The Collateral and the Guarantee will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other_**
**_imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the_**
**_Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections_**
**_could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the Guarantee, as well as the ability of the Security_**
**_Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral and the Guarantee. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of_**
**_security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection_**
**_requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The granting of the Guarantee and_**
**_any security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the_**
**_future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the_**
**_laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantee and any security interests to secure the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility
may create hardening, claw back or voidance periods for such Guarantee and security interests in certain
jurisdictions, including Italy. The granting of shared security interests (including security interests in the
Collateral), including in connection with any release and retake of such security interest, to secure existing, new
or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the
transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening or claw back periods in certain
jurisdictions, including Italy. The applicable hardening, claw back or voidance period for these new security
interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or
recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the
end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void,
ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security
interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and
retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security
interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts

74


-----

could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security_
_Interests.”_

The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several
circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity
interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of
Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral
that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be
subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph.

Similar considerations also apply following the Acquisition Closing Date, in connection with the accession of
further subsidiaries as guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The
existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The
Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in
collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest.
The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have
the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore,
because the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be
governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and enforcement may be
further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be complicated,_**
**_involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate and may require prior approval by certain regulatory_**
**_bodies._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations,
any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result
in a taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares
of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In
addition, the Indenture does not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future.
Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the
Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce
the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over
the shares of the Issuer may be limited.

In addition, even if we received the approval by the presidency of the Italian Council of Ministries, Italian
Golden Power Legislation (including the clearances regime) will continue to be applicable to the Target and,
following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo, in case the relevant entity is involved in any transaction, act
or resolution falling within the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation, including, among others, any
transfers of the Target’s and MergerCo’s shares, including upon enforcement of the Target’s share pledge (if
any) and Issuer’s share pledge (and, following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo’s share pledge), the
granting and/or enforcement of security over certain assets of the Target and/or any other transactions triggering
a change of control covered by such legislation.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of
a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

75


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions
of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law, as
applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged
assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that
are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured
and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including Italy). In
certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the
creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and any future Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt
provisions would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the
pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests
for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the
Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel
Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In
respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except
through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of
the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities
and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law,
and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not
validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not
receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security_
_Interests.”_

For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the
holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision
(introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond
issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then
be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or
available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_
of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified
therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes
could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under
the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
**period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the**
Offering. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given
statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even
if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions
of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the
Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the

76


-----

Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens.
Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security
interest, the holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in Collateral or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the
Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps
or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent_**
**_obtaining your further consent._**

Pursuant to the Indenture, under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically, including a sale or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the
asset sale covenant of the Indenture, as applicable, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under
the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries
that are guarantors of the Notes as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted
subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any
Guarantee of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the
Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all_**
**_noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes or_**
**_the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders”, the majority
required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons
holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant
series of Notes, as the case may be. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the
nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be,
including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted
in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may
include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest
in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the
redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements
relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment
provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material
adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half
of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is
untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged,
may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced
from 75% to 50%. Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in
meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.

**_The insolvency laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance_**
**_statutes, may adversely affect validity and enforceability._**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer. Under certain
circumstances, in the event that the Post- Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the
Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and
certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Target guarantees the Notes. On the Issue Date,
our obligations under the Notes, subject to certain agreed security principles, will be secured by security interests

-----

over the Escrowed Property, on a first priority basis. On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be
secured on a first-ranking basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by
the Completion Collateral. Within 20 Business Days from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be
secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, by the Post-Completion
Collateral. The Issuer and the Target are incorporated under the laws of Italy. There is a rebuttable presumption
that the “center of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where
the registered office is situated.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws
of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuer, a Guarantor or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are
untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the
event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in
jurisdictions you may be familiar with).

As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral in an insolvency
situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable
principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such
jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee
against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security
interests or the Guarantee in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest
if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer,
conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles,
which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator
may challenge the Guarantee and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences,
transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such
laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

‰ avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the
security interests provided by such security provider;

‰ direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or
any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund
for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

‰ take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or security interests are found to be a
preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we
cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the
amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.

The amount recoverable from the Guarantor and the security providers under the Security Documents will also
be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security
interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Guarantee and
_the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” and “—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee and the Collateral.”_

-----

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantee were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors
or security provider:

‰ issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or
created such security after its insolvency;

‰ issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity
to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or
security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantee or security provider was
insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made;

‰ received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interest were incurred
for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some
other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the creation
of the Guarantee or security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons,
(ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or
security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it
would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would
become due;

‰ the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the
opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or

‰ the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any security
interest if:

‰ its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

‰ it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

‰ the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that the Issuer and the Target are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantee were issued or the security interests were created
or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that
payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to
secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors
under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year
prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or
undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual
means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby
the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any
claw back action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove
his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action
during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and

79


-----

payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the
insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity
in order to enforce any claw back action. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests” for further information._

Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition,
under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency
declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period
prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU.

If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts
under the related Security Documents.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the security interests, see
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee
_and the Security Interests.”_

**_The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the Post-Completion Merger (if it_**
**_occurs) may be subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors._**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity
subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a
company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other
creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into
account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness
compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and
not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one
year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded
that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be
applicable in respect of the Funding Loan borrowed by the Target. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude
that the Target’s obligations under the Funding Loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other
creditors. Should the Target’s obligations under the Funding Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations
owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, prior to the Post-Completion Merger
the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Funding Loan, which could have a material adverse
effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans
(including the Funding Loan) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the
Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or
security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including, under certain circumstances in the event that the
Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantee to be provided by the Target) may
be impaired or restricted.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes have not been, and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Securities are being offered and sold only (i) to QIBs in reliance
on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States in an offshore transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance
on Regulation S. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of
investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to:

‰ the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

‰ your ability to sell your Notes; or

‰ the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the market for the
Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic
conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as third-party recommendations.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue
such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market
for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption in the trading
market for the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or
remain listed, whether on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or elsewhere. Although no assurance is made as to
the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved
for listing or the delisting of the Notes (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock
exchange), as applicable, from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect
on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_If any Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that any Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due_
to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as that carried by the relevant series of Notes.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale_**
**_offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding_**
**_Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to
purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the
Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer and may need
to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing
on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the

81


-----

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the
acceleration of such indebtedness (even if such change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
may be deemed not to be a change of control for the purposes of the Indenture). Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or
other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset sale
offer, as defined under the Indenture, to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to offer to
purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”

In connection with certain tender offers for either series of Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders of Notes, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such offer. See “Description of
_the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “change of control” and the corresponding to the paragraph under “Description of the Notes—
_Merger and Consolidation” covenant in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or_
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly
established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction
and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes issued under the Indenture
receive an investment grade rating from two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and no default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as the Notes are no longer
rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants and Release of the Notes Security
_Interest on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will_

82


-----

be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated
indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can
be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved
will be maintained.

**_The merger of the Issuer with the Target and the assumption of obligations under the Notes by the resulting_**
**_entity may be treated as a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the conditions for the Post-Completion Merger are met, the Issuer will merge with the Target, with MergerCo
being the surviving entity. MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to
do so) that these transactions will not be treated as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. It is possible, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could take a contrary view, and
seek to treat the Post-Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as
resulting in a taxable exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S.
holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) would
recognize gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange (although any loss could be disallowed) and
would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
addition, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the Post-Completion Merger is less than the principal
amount of such Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as
issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“OID”). Please see “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of the
Notes—IPO Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a taxable exchange of the Notes for “new”
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such_
taxable exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax
basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the
Notes at the time of the IPO Pushdown is less than the principal amount of such Notes (by more than a statutorily
defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with OID. Please see “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”_

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other adverse tax consequences as a result of investing in_**
**_the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the Notes will
entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below
their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to U.S. investors on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Notes
by U.S. investors may have other significant tax consequences. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_federal income tax considerations.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies_**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holders of the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to Elavon Financial
Services DAC, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes
representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a
book-entry interest in the relevant Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if
you are not a participant in Euroclear and Clearstream on the procedures of the participant through which you
own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

83


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if
you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance
that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
matters or timely basis.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The interests of the Sponsor and Cometa may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will indirectly hold through HoldCo 75% of the share
capital of the Target, while Cometa, one of the two existing shareholders of the Target, will hold the remaining
25% (the “Future Shareholders”). Concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Target will be
directly wholly owned by the Issuer. As a result, each of the Sponsor and Cometa has, directly or indirectly, the
power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to
approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. The Future Shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as
holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due.
For example, the Future Shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Moreover, the
Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses
that compete directly or indirectly with us and/or that operate in our markets or adjacent ones. The Sponsor may
also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Future Shareholders may hold
interests in suppliers or customers of the Target. The Future Shareholders will enter into a shareholders’
agreement on the Acquisition Closing Date that provides for the governance rules of, among others, HoldCo, the
Issuer and the Target. All significant actions to be taken by HoldCo, the Issuer and the Target will require
approval of the board of directors of HoldCo, the Issuer and the Target (as the case may be), which will include
members designated by the Sponsor and Cometa. If a matter is not approved by the relevant board of directors
due to a deadlock, the relevant resolution shall not be adopted. As a result, even when your interests are aligned
with the interests of the Sponsor, Cometa may disagree and vice versa and be entitled to vote against a decision
that would be in your interest. Any such deadlock, if not promptly resolved, could adversely affect our business.
The Sponsor and its affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or
more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our
shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could
enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. See
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €375.0 million. The gross proceeds from the
Offering will be used, together with the Shareholder Funding and cash on the Target’s balance sheet, to
(i) finance the purchase price for the Acquisition, (ii) refinance the Refinanced Target Indebtedness, including
accrued interest thereon, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (iv) fund cash to the
Target’s balance sheet for general corporate purposes. See also “Summary—The Transactions.”

The estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table
below assuming the Acquisition Closing Date had occurred on June 30, 2021. Actual amounts will vary from the
amounts shown in this table depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition Closing Date, the
outstanding amount of borrowings and accrued interest under the Refinanced Target Indebtedness on such date,
the amount of cash available on the balance sheet of the Target on such date and differences from our estimates
of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions.

(1) The Shareholder Funding comprises (a) an equity contribution to be provided by HoldCo to the Issuer (in the amount of €182.0 million)
and (b) a deeply subordinated shareholder loan by HoldCo to the Issuer for an amount of €728.1 million (the “Shareholder Loan”).

(2) Represents the amount of cash and cash equivalents on the Target’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 that is expected to be used,
together with a portion of the amounts made available under the Funding Loan, to repay in full and cancel the Refinanced Target
Indebtedness on the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.”

(3) Represents the estimated cash purchase price payable to the Sellers for the shares of the Target to be acquired under the Acquisition
Agreement on the Acquisition Closing Date and to be financed by using the proceeds from the Shareholder Funding and all the proceeds
from virtual tranche A (“Tranche A”) under the Notes, as further described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, which we expect Target to repay in
full and cancel on the Acquisition Closing Date using the proceeds from the Funding Loan, to be made by the Issuer to the Target on or
about the Acquisition Closing Date by using a portion of the proceeds from virtual tranche B (“Tranche B”) under the Notes, as further
described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above. The principal amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness shown in the
table above excludes accrued and unpaid interest of €0.6 million as of June 30, 2021. The principal amount of Refinanced Target
Indebtedness as well as the amount of accrued and unpaid interest outstanding and payable on the Acquisition Closing Date may vary
from the amounts outstanding and due on June 30, 2021. If the amount required to repay the Refinanced Target Indebtedness on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount set forth in the table above, the amount of cash on balance sheet following the
Transactions will be reduced commensurately. See “Capitalization.”

(5) Represents the estimated fees and expenses that will be payable in connection with the Transactions, including legal and other advisor
fees and transaction expenses to be financed with all the proceeds from virtual tranche C (“Tranche C”) under the Notes, as further
described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above. The actual amount of fees and expenses payable on the Acquisition
Closing Date may differ from the estimated amount shown in the table above. If the actual amount of fees and expenses payable on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount set forth in the table above, the amount of cash on balance sheet following the
Transactions will be reduced commensurately.

(5) Represents the estimated amount of cash that will be funded to the Target’s balance sheet in connection with the Transactions, which will
be used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, funding future capital expenditures, the payment of interest or the
repayment of debt, including the Refinanced Target Indebtedness in the event the amount required to repay such indebtedness on the
Acquisition Closing Date exceeds the estimated amount of Refinanced Target Indebtedness set forth in the table above. See
“Capitalization.”

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and the capitalization (i) of the Target on a historical
basis, as of June 30, 2021 and (ii) of the Issuer as adjusted to give effect to the consummation of the
Transactions, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021. Amounts presented in the table below exclude capitalized
debt issuance costs. Unless otherwise noted, the adjustments column does not give effect to movements in cash
and cash equivalents or amounts borrowed or repaid after June 30, 2021. We believe that presenting the cash and
cash equivalents and capitalization of the Issuer in this manner is the most meaningful way to present the
financial position of the Issuer after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021,
given the Issuer is a holding company formed in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating
activities of its own and without any business operations, material assets or liabilities, other than those incurred
in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions.

The following tables should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements” and the Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

the Transactions, including cash overfunding on balance sheet of the Issuer of €26.2 million as described under “Use of Proceeds.” Our
cash and cash equivalents as of the estimated Acquisition Closing Date might differ from our estimates due to a number of factors,
including the timing of the Acquisition Closing Date and the amount of cash generated and not utilized by the Target between June 30,
2021 and the Acquisition Closing Date.

(2) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility of up to €125.0 million and is expected to be undrawn on the
Acquisition Closing Date.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

(4) Represents the principal amount of the Refinanced Target Indebtedness (€119.8 million), which we expect to repay in full in connection
with the Transactions. Amounts shown exclude accrued and unpaid interest of €0.6 million as of June 30, 2021.

(5) Represents the principal amount of Rolled Target Indebtedness (€15.9 million), consisting of certain short-term facilities which we
expect to remain outstanding following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Rolled
_Target Indebtedness.”_

(6) Represents the amount of bank loans and borrowings and other current and non-current financial liabilities of €133.9 million plus €2.7
million arising from amortized cost accounting, less €0.6 million of accrued and unpaid interest and €0.1 million of debts for credit cards.

(7) Represents lease liabilities under IFRS 16 as of June 30, 2021.

(8) As adjusted total equity and Shareholders Funding represents the equity contribution in the amount of €182.0 million plus the deeply
subordinated shareholder funding in the amount of €728.1 million provided to the Issuer by HoldCo in connection with the Transactions.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in the periods set_
_forth below. This discussion should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our_
_Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and the related notes thereto. The following discussion_
_should also be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Information,” and “Summary Historical_
_Consolidated and Other Financial Information.” The discussion in this section may contain forward-looking_
_statements reflecting our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results_
_could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or_
_contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, particularly under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Overview**

We are the largest provider of broadband (“BB”) and ultra-broadband (“UBB”) fixed-wireless access (“FWA”)
services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the second largest based on
number of subscribers with a market share of 34.7% for year ended March 31, 2021. Our mission is to close the
digital and speed divide by offering high-speed broadband connectivity services in underserved rural (i.e., White
areas) and suburban areas (i.e., Grey II areas) in Italy where alternative connection technologies are either
unavailable or significantly delayed (i.e., FTTH) or have lower speed and quality performance (i.e., ADSL or
FTTC). As a result, we mainly focus on identified rural and suburban areas comprising approximately
11.5 million households in Italy where the penetration of broadband connection services is lower than in the rest
of Italy and where we offer the highest available speed (our “Target Addressable Market” or “TAM”). Our
unique FWA infrastructure platform enables us to offer in our Target Addressable Market, in a cost-effective
manner, speeds of up to 100 Mbps (download speed) and we are working to increase connection speeds to 300
Mbps in the near future to further distinguish our service offer. With selected business customers, we already
offer speeds of up 1 Gbps (download speed) through point-to-point (“PTP”) wireless link connections. In recent
years, we have aggressively expanded our FWA network coverage to reach more than 80% of households in our
Target Addressable Market and more than 6,700 municipalities across Italy’s 20 regions. This resulted in a strong
growth of our subscriber base from approximately 379,600 as of March 31, 2019 to 567,900 as of June 30, 2021,
with a CAGR of 19.6%. Our market share in our Target Addressable Market was 51.5% of FWA connections as
of March 31, 2021.

We own, lease and operate a unique proprietary end-to-end infrastructure network that enables us to offer a highquality service to our customers. Our FWA infrastructure covers the complete end-to-end core, distribution and
access networks of the fixed data transmission chain.

**EOLO’S END TO END INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK**

Š _Core Network. Our core network leverages on four core national points of presence (“POP”), five core_
regional POP and two data centers connected through our backbone. Our backbone is secured by longterm indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”) of third parties’ dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800
kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018);

Š _Distribution Network. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. As of_
March 31, 2021, our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we

signed an agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 fiber-to-the-antenna links to base transceiver
stations (“BTS”) (i.e., fiber-to-the-antenna). As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600 radio
links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately +41% compared to March 31, 2018); and

Š _Access Network. As of August 31, 2021, our access network is based on approximately 3,400 BTS (an_
increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018), which deliver signal to the customer
premises equipment (the “CPE”), installed on customers’ premises, primarily using (i) the unlicensed
5GHz spectrum (for our 30 Mbps EOLO Wave offering) and (ii) the licensed 28 GHz spectrum (for our
advanced, higher speed 100 Mbps EOLO Wave G offering).

Our external network of approximately 1,500 technicians (known as “installers”) across Italy provides us with
in-depth local knowledge and a capillary presence in our Target Addressable Market, which in turn is
instrumental to our ability to offer high service levels.

As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network
that is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We offer our excess capacity on a wholesale basis to other
operators who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to acquire new customers or migrate customers currently served
through non-performing technologies in Italian rural and suburban areas. Building on this strategy, in 2020 we
signed an agreement with Wind 3 and in 2021 announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM; these
strategic partnership projects are focused on our Target Addressable Market, where TIM and Wind 3 will be able
to provide internet access services to their existing and new customers using our proprietary infrastructure
network.

We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth,
particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of coaxial cable infrastructure, delays in fiber
roll-out and difficult geographic terrain, only approximately 67% of Italian households as of December 31, 2019
had a fixed broadband connection as compared to a European average penetration rate of approximately 87% as
of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services, principally through FWA technology in rural and
suburban areas, are expected to continue to expand and close this penetration gap on the back of growing data
consumption driven by changing consumer habits (such as remote working) and the growing use of online
streaming, which trend has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We believe that there is an untapped growth opportunity in our Target Addressable Market, where broadband
penetration and high-speed connections are significantly lower than the national average level (penetration levels
between 56% and 60%). Given the physical geography and low population density of many Italian rural and
suburban communities, FWA can be the best technological alternative to deliver high broadband speeds at
competitive prices given its limited roll-out costs and fast network deployment times in these areas. Legacy
technologies (i.e., ADSL and FTTC) are proving less effective to meet the growing demand for bandwidth, while
FTTH is either not going to be deployed or will be deployed only with delays in these areas, in part due to the
significant investments required. As the largest provider of broadband and ultra-broadband services in our Target
Addressable Market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to exploit this growth opportunity.

The expansion of our FWA network and service offering in recent years has driven the growth of our total
revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. From the year ended March 31, 2019 our total revenues and
other income and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million, respectively, to
€198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a CAGR of 23.0%), respectively, for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021. For the same period, our loss for the year/period increased from €0.5 million to
€14.9 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 94% of our total revenues and other income was
generated from subscription-based revenues from monthly recurring debits by customers and approximately 6%
was generated from one-off payments, including activation fees and penalties for churned customers.

We divide our offering into the following three segments:

Š **Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 490,700 B2C**
subscribers (“B2C Subscribers”). Our offering to B2C Subscribers includes modular commercial
offerings designed to address different users’ needs with dedicated add-on packages: “Entertainment”
(streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and remote working applications) and “Security”
(antivirus and parental control).

Š **Business-to-Business (“B2B”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 75,900 B2B subscribers**
(“B2B Subscribers”). Our offering to B2B Subscribers includes connectivity services for small and

90


-----

home offices (“SoHo”) and small and medium enterprises (“Business”) to which we offer shared
solutions, and for large companies (“TOP”) to which we offer services through high-end connectivity
and dedicated infrastructure.

Š **FTTH. Although it does not represent our core business, we provide a FTTH service mainly in certain**
urban areas covered by Open Fiber’s FTTH infrastructure to complement our FWA services in order to
meet customer demand. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,400 fiber subscribers (“Fiber
**Subscribers”).**

As of June 30, 2021, our B2C and B2B Subscribers included approximately 48,500 wholesale end-customers
(“Wholesale Subscribers”). We sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through internet service providers (“ISP”),
system integrators and to national internet providers and international telecommunications providers to whom we
offer our excess capacity. We plan to strengthen our wholesale offering in the future relying more on major
national and international providers such as TIM and Wind 3 and further expand our wholesale offering to retail
customers.

The below charts set forth the percentage of our total revenues and other income and number of subscribers
represented by each of our three offering segments for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Set forth below are certain key factors that historically have affected our results of operations, and which may
impact our results of operations in the future.

**_Demand for connectivity, digitalization, the connected home and the Internet of Things_**

Our services are situated at the conflux of a number of megatrends that are redefining work, socialization, leisure
and learning, namely the demand for connectivity, digitalization, the connected home and the Internet of Things.

Š **Demand for connectivity: Individuals increasingly consider broadband Internet an essential**
utility to support their working, learning, socializing and entertainment. The Italian fixed
broadband (FBB) market comprised 18.37 million active lines as of March 2021 and is
characterized by continued growth and increasing demand for high-speed broadband internet
services. Fixed broadband connections grew at a 4% CAGR (2015 to March 2021) with the
natural demand evolution towards high-speed internet services resulting in strong penetration of
ultrabroadband (UBB) connections (30 Mbps or higher speed) reaching approximately 67% of
total lines as of March 2020 (as compared to 8% of total lines as of March 2015).

Š **Digitalization: Demand for streamed entertainment, including on-demand music and video from**
platforms such as Netflix, Disney Plus, AppleTV+, YouTube, Spotify and Deezer have increased
significantly. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of streamed
entertainment further increased significantly as well as the need for reliable and fast connectivity
related to online working and learning. Moreover, in 2021, DAZN, a global sports streaming
platform, acquired the rights to broadcast seven out of 10 exclusive matches per match week in
Italy from 2021 to 2024 for Serie A football. This represents the first time that Italian football
matches will be shown via streaming as the primary broadcaster of the competition, and the

91


-----

majority of Serie A football matches will no longer be available via satellite channels. Such a shift
embodies the trend of the digitalization of broadcast television and the switch to streaming content
requiring broadband connections.

Š **The connected home: The use of connected audio and video entertainment devices in particular**
has become relatively widespread: in 2020, for example, 51% of individuals in the EU reported to
EUROSTAT that they used the internet on a smart TV, games console, home audio system, or
smart speaker. Moreover, 11% of EU citizens surveyed in 2020 used a voice assistant. As homes
become more connected to multiple devices, broadband, in particular wireless connectivity, is
becoming more central.

Š **The Internet of Things: Smart wearable devices are also becoming a feature of EU citizens’**
lives. In 2020, 19% of individuals in the EU used a smart watch, fitness band, connected goggles
or headset, safety tracker or smart clothing, accessories, or shoes. The highly connected nature of
this proliferation of Internet of Things devices means that broadband Internet demand is
accelerating.

On the back of these trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to continue growing for the period 2021-2024,
driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage.

The graphic below shows the monthly data traffic in Italy for the period 2017-2020 and the forecast for the
period 2021-2024.

The total number of subscribers we serve affects our results of operations. We typically have high revenue
visibility due to stickiness of our subscriber contracts and an industry-leading low churn rate as discussed below
under “—Customer churn rate.” The addition of new subscribers has the following impact on our results of
operations:

Š marketing and sales and selling commissions increase in anticipation of and during periods of
intense net subscriber increases; and

Š to retain subscribers, we incur costs to invest to maintain quality of service, invest in customer
care functions, replace obsolescent equipment and maintain our network.

We focus on the B2C segment. Our subscription models start at €24.90 per month with various add-ons designed
to address different users’ needs, such as for work, study and entertainment, including software, connection speed
and security options. In general, the greater the optionality, the higher the price of the subscription package, up to
€36.90.

Our ability to grow our subscriber base depends in part on our customer service providers and our community of
installers, in particular for the growth of our B2C segment. Customer assistance services help us build and
maintain good relationships with our customers, which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business.
We outsource our CPE installation and replacement to around 600 contractors and 1,500 technicians that are
trained by us, which are distributed across the country. We support the growth of our community of installers by
providing continuous training, assistance, equipment and engagement activities. Our installers have direct access
to our clients (i.e., entering into their homes) and their role is key for our success. In addition, the majority of our
installers also promote our services, which allows us to realize synergies and strengthen our national sale
network.

**_Development of our infrastructure network_**

Italy’s topography, population density and lack of cable infrastructure have created ideal conditions for FWA to
establish itself and we believe there is a significant untapped market opportunity in rural and suburban areas
(approximately 11.5 million households according to our estimates based on AGCOM, EUROSTAT, and ISTAT
data). Broadband penetration in Italy (67%) is materially lower than the European Union average (87%). Our
results of operations are affected by the continued development in our infrastructure network, namely: (i) the
expansion of coverage, particularly from the North of Italy, where EOLO has historically been present, to the
South of Italy and (ii) upgrading infrastructure network from 5 GHz to 28 GHz bandwidth.

We typically monitor and plan the development of infrastructure network through the number of municipalities
we cover within Italy.

Expansion of our infrastructure network affects our results of operations in the following ways:

Š drives revenue growth as the more subscribers and communities we can reach, the greater our
addressable subscriber base;

Š increases our operating expenses, in particular related to purchases of materials and services and
labor costs, though each tend to remain fairly stable as a percentage of revenues as further
described under “—Our cost structure”;

Š increases our growth capital expenditures, which in presents the following dynamic:

Š **infrastructure network expansion: installation of additional BTS permits us to offer FWA**
services in new communities, thereby encouraging a growth in our subscriber base; FWA
technology offers the competitive advantage that capital expenditures are majority successbased as construction, installation and rent payments for BTS represent less than the majority
of the Total Capital Expenditures (capital expenditures at risk),

Š **success-based customer connections: the majority of growth capital expenditures necessary**
to connect a subscriber corresponds to CPE and activation expenses which are incurred in
connection with the activation of a new subscription plan once future revenue is secured
(success based capital expenditures); and

93


-----

Š increases our capital expenditures; as CPE withdrawal capital expenditures are incurred for
churned customers and replacement and repairing capital expenditures increase with a larger
customer base.

We have invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2019 to the year ended March 31,
2021. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Total Capital Expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures.”

The graphics below show our FWA network coverage by region as percentage of households and number of
active BTS covered as of June 30, 2021.

The following graphics set forth our 5 GHz and 28 GHz network coverage by region, in each case based on

migrate more subscribers from 5 GHz to 28 GHz plans which can increase quality of service.

**_Macroeconomic conditions_**

We operate solely in Italy and therefore our results of operations can be affected by general economic conditions
and consumer discretionary spending in Italy. According to the OECD, communications services are increasingly
perceived as non-discretionary spending items and therefore households seeking to economize will typically do
so in other areas; therefore, our revenues typically exhibit less volatility during times of economic stress.
Connectivity services are increasingly seen as of an essential nature (e.g. work-from-home, home-schooling) as
evidenced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, when economic growth is robust, consumers tend
to have more disposable income and may increase add-ons or upgrade to a higher category of service, which can
increase our operating margins given the fixed costs of our business. Conversely, however, when economic
growth is stagnant or negative, consumers may downsize to a less expensive plan. The lockdowns during
COVID-19 increased demand for connectivity as many worked-from-home, studied remotely and consumed
streaming content as many diversions and entertainment options were curtailed during the lockdown.

**_Our cost structure_**

Our costs primarily consist of personnel costs, marketing costs and network costs. Personnel costs are primarily
related to our Sales and Marketing, Network and Technology and Customer and Operations teams. Over the last
three years, we reorganized the Customer and Operations team, implementing an externalization of the workforce
which has led to increased efficiency. As part of the reorganization, we formed a Customer and Operations team
and restructured the HD, Customer Service, Credit and Delivery Operations teams into a single organizational
structure with common performance measurement metrics. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 40% of the total
costs of our customer service is attributable to our external provider in Albania (approximately 60% of the
workforce in terms of FTEs is externalized). We have also undertaken actions to streamline our fixed cost
structure through a new customer relationship management system (“CRM”) designed to track our subscriber
interactions from service requests to billing and collections and focus on BTS rental costs. Our marketing costs
are composed by sales commissions as well as marketing expenses, which are mainly variable as they relate to
new subscribers acquisition and therefore they increase in absolute value alongside the growth of the customer
base. As part of our strategy to continue the expansion of our wholesale footprint, we offer our excess capacity to
other operators, which will reduce our subscriber acquisition costs. Our network costs primarily relate to the
rental of BTS sites, expenditure on fiber links rental and recurring expenses relating to the operation of the
network (radio link licenses, electricity costs and maintenance). In recent years, we have significantly expanded
our network to improve backhaul and backbone capacity and cover additional regions of Italy.

**_Customer churn rate_**

The fixed broadband market generally exhibits churn as a result of high levels of competition. In addition to
competitive alternatives, churn levels may be affected by changes in our prices or our competitors’ prices, our
level of subscriber satisfaction, subscriber mortality and the relocation of subscribers, as well as from the
termination of agreements. An increase in churn may lead to increased costs and reduced revenues as we incur
additional capital expenditures in the form of withdrawal of CPEs and we typically incur additional marketing
and advertising costs to acquire new subscribers. Our relatively low churn rates provide us with recurring cash
flows and visibility with respect to future revenues. We have historically experienced low churn rates, and the
churn we have experienced has primarily been driven by customers moving outside of our current geographic
area of services as well as termination of services due to customer’s inability to pay, with only a limited amount
of churn due to a lack of customer satisfaction. We believe that maintaining good level of service, investing in
our network infrastructure and offering transparent pricing plans will allow us to maintain low churn rates
compared to the industry average. Additionally, we believe that the Internet represents a fundamental tool of
social inclusion and being the first provider to arrive with broadband in a given community in our Core TAM has
provided us with an advantage in maintaining our customer base.

The historical churn rate is higher 5 GHz products as compared to 28 GHz products as 28 GHz products have
higher performance and low market competition in the areas we serve. As a result, one of the tools that we have
to proactively prevent churn is to offer upgrades to customers who may be served by BTS that are over-utilized
in the 5 GHz bandwidth; even using 5 GHz product, a customer who transitions to the 28 GHz bandwidth will
experience a faster connection which can in turn lead to upselling as customers switch to a higher speed plan.

Churn rates in the year ended March 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was higher than in
prior periods due to the one-off effect of the lockdown driven by unexpected network overload which resulted in
more frequent technical issues and a lower quality of service delivered to customers; however, management
expects that churn will return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the year ending March 31, 2022 as network capacity
bottlenecks were addressed during the year ended March 31, 2021.

95


-----

We define “Blended Churn Rate” as the churn rate determined by dividing the subscribers lost in a period of
time (the number of customers that either on a voluntary or involuntary basis no longer subscribe for our
services) by the average number of subscribers for such period.


**For the year ended March 31,**


**For the**

The above levels compare with average churn rates for the Italian broadband market of 26.3%, 22.7% and 24.2%
for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

**_Regulation_**

We hold licenses for the 26 GHz spectrum at national level, the 28 GHz spectrum at national level, the 3.5 GHz
spectrum for the Valle d’Aosta region and the 6-11-13-18-80 GHz frequencies which are licensed on a
link-by-link basis by the MED. In addition, we also use 5 GHz spectrum on a non-licensed basis.

Our licenses for the 26 spectrum and 28 GHz spectrum were awarded during certain tender procedures issued by
the MED in 2014, 2016 and 2018 for a total consideration of €12.5 million. These licenses will expire on
December 31, 2022. We have submitted the application for the extension of such licenses to the MED. We expect
that the procedure will be finalized by the end of 2021 for the 28 GHz spectrum and by the first quarter of 2022
for 26 GHz spectrum. We expect that the amounts to secure renewals of our 28 GHz and 26 GHz licenses, will be
higher than those paid during the 2014, 2016 and 2018 tender procedures.

Our license for the 3.5 GHz spectrum was awarded by the MED in 2013. This license provides us with the right
to use the band 3.4-3.6 GHz in the Valle d’Aosta region and will expire on May 21, 2023. Our license for the
6-11-13-18-80 GHz spectrum have an automatic annual renewal and will expire together with the general
authorization for the supply of electronic communications network and services in 2034. See “Regulation.”

**Key Performance Indicators**

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The
key measures for determining how our business is performing are (i) the number of subscribers as reported by
AGCOM (divided into the Italian broadband market generally and the Italian FWA market specifically), (ii) the
number of subscribers by product (as discussed above under “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Growth in subscriber base and mix of subscriber pricing plans”), (iii) Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA,_
(iv) Blended ARPU, (v) Blended Churn Rate (as discussed above under “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Customer churn rate”) and (vi) the breakdown of capital expenditures by asset (as discussed below_
under “—Total Capital Expenditures and Adjusted Capital Expenditures”). Such indicators are operational in
nature and may include financial information not derived from our accounting system and are not recognized
measurements of financial performance under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Non-IFRS Financial Information.”_

**_Number of subscribers_**

An important indicator regarding the attractiveness of our technology (FWA) that management actively tracks is
the number of subscribers in the Italian broadband market generally and the Italian FWA market specifically. An
increase in the number of FWA subscribers as a percentage of the total Italian broadband market indicates that
the FWA technology that we offer is attractive and that additional households or business customers are using
FWA service.

The following sets forth the number of subscribers in the Italian broadband market and Italian FWA market for
the periods indicated as well as the percentage of FWA subscribers as a percentage of total subscriber base.

(b) _Impairment losses on non-current assets: refers to the reduction in the value of our certain assets within property, plant and equipment_
due to obsolescence. As a non-cash effect, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Reported EBITDA to better
illustrate the performance associated with our business.

(c) _LTIP: represents the accrual of the award to senior management of one-off payments under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in_
place prior to the Transactions. The LTIP had an original timeframe up to 2025 and contemplated a one off payment to senior
management linked to specific, pre-agreed liquidity events such the sale of EOLO. Every fiscal year a liability is recorded as a charge to
the statement of profit and loss based on the estimated payout and trigger date. For the year ended March 31, 2021 and the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, as the sale process started in January 2021 and a sale had become probable prior to the original LTIP duration
(2025), the valuation we performed in connection with the Acquisition triggered a significant accrual. The LTIP is expected to be
replaced by a new Management Co-Investment Plan. It is expected that members of senior management will re-invest part of the
proceeds received under the LTIP into the new Management Co-Investment Plan and/or in connection with the reinvestment related to
the Acquisition. As the LTIP accrual was one-off, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Reported
EBITDA. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan” and “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Acquisition.”_

(d) _2020 institutional advertising campaign: represent the costs associated with an institutional and exceptional advertising campaign_
realized in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awareness towards authorities of the role that EOLO plays in the Italian
internet connectivity landscape. As management considers this campaign as a one-off and connected to the fact that it was necessary to
highlight the need for connectivity in Italy outside of large urban areas and their immediate environs which became more apparent during
the COVID-19 pandemic, management performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA.

(e) _Monitoring fees: represent the fees paid to our current shareholders for their consulting, monitoring and advisory services. Management_
performed this adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to illustrate the performance of the underlying business
without giving effect to the shareholding structure which will change with the Acquisition. See “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Acquisition.”_

(f) _Transactions costs: represent costs, including external M&A advisors and financial, commercial and legal due diligence fees and_
expenses, in respect of the Acquisition in 2021 and a new capital expenditure line signed in 2019. As these are one-off costs that were
incurred in connection with extraordinary transactions, management performed this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted
EBITDA.

(g) _Commission and activation fees: represent the net EBITDA contribution of new clients’ acquisition, including revenues for activation_
fees and sales commissions paid to our salesforce. Revenues for activation fees are deferred over the contract term agreed with the

-----

customer (mainly 24 months). Sales commissions are capitalized as “contract costs” since they are considered incremental costs of
obtaining a contract. They are recognized as operating expense over a period of 24 months consistent with the pattern of transfer of
service to which they relate and the judgment that management applied in the revenue recognition policy. Most of our
telecommunications competitors recognize such items in profit or loss over a longer period, based on their estimate of customers’
propensity to discontinue their subscriptions. For illustrative purposes, this adjustment applies such a convention assuming a period of
time of seven years. Management considers that this adjustment can assist investors in evaluating our results of operations compared to
our competitors.

(h) _CPE installation related costs: our business requires CPEs, which are devices that enable consumers to access communication services_
and permit us to distribute our services. Our operating model involves re-using CPEs from churned customers in order to efficiently use
our property, plant and equipment base. The following briefly explains the main components of this adjustment: (i) installation costs for
re-using CPEs at new customers’ premises, (ii) installation costs for CPE repairing/substituting and upselling of CPEs associated with
subscriber migration from 5 GHz to 28 GHz or proactive churn prevention to relieve network bottlenecks, (iii) installation costs for CPE
withdrawal from the premises of churned customers (CPEs are then reconditioned and reused), and (iv) installation costs for activation
“KO” which relate to payments to technicians for CPE installation at potential new customers’ premises, where the subscription was
aborted due to lack of feasibility of our FWA technology at the site (i.e., no line-of-sight access between the location and the BTS). They
represent relocation costs and therefore do not qualify for recognition as part of property, plant and equipment under IFRS. EOLO’s
management considers such costs as part of the costs incurred for creation, improvement and maintenance of its infrastructure network
and therefore added it back for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the above, EOLO’s management considers that this
adjustment can assist investors in evaluating the operating results obtained through our infrastructure network. Moreover, the same
adjustment is utilized in calculating Adjusted Capital Expenditure as described under footnote (3) to show the overall investment in our
infrastructure network, with no impact on cash flows.

(i) _Legacy ADSL business: this adjustment adds back the net negative EBITDA contribution associated with the ADSL business. ADSL_
represents a form of delivering broadband connectivity using telephone lines and is considered an obsolete technology that generally
provides slower navigation and is more expensive to deliver than FWA technology, our core business. As of June 30, 2021, we had
approximately 500 residual subscribers of ADSL services. We are actively encouraging ADSL subscribers to migrate to other
technologies. Due to the fact that EOLO’s management will not further invest in ADSL technology, management performed this
adjustment for purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA as it can assist investors in understanding EOLO’s core business.

(j) _Other: mainly includes grants from Infratel on items that have been recognized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over_
time. In order to adjust for one-off and non-operating income items, EOLO’s management performed this adjustment for purposes of
preparing Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, for the year ended March 31, 2019, this line item includes the reversal of a payroll item that
by its nature EOLO’s management believes is similar to the payroll expenses that were capitalized in the year ended March 31, 2019.

(k) _Run-Rate impact: is calculated as the EBITDA that EOLO would have generated during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021_
period if subscribers as of June 30, 2021 had been subscribers for the entire period, applying the Blended ARPU for the twelve months
period to such subscriber base. Management considers that this adjustment shows, on an illustrative basis, the cash generation effect of
new customer acquisitions driven by recent structural trends that have increased demand for high-speed connectivity. This further
adjustment to Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what EBITDA would have
been had these new subscribers been acquired on July 1, 2020 nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The
assumptions underlying this adjustment are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
cause actual results or performance to be materially different from future results or performance expressed or implied by such
adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering
_Memorandum is based on estimates and assumptions in respect of certain adjustments which are subject to significant uncertainties.”_

**_Blended ARPU_**

Blended ARPU is calculated by diving the total revenue generated from monthly subscription payments during a
period of time by the average number of subscribers during such period. We believe that Blended ARPU
provides useful information concerning the appeal and usage patterns of service offerings and our performance in
attracting and retaining high value Subscribers. Our Blended ARPU has been stable over the period under
discussion.

The decrease of our Blended ARPU between the year ended March 31, 2019 to the twelve months ended June 30,
2021 was primarily attributable to the growth of our customer base and the change in mix of our product
offerings for B2B customers.

**_Three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020_**

**_Total revenue and other income. Total revenue and other income increased by €6.5 million, or 14.4%, to_**
€51.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from €45.0 million for the three months ended June 30,
2020. This increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues for growth of our customer base. We recorded
a total net subscriber increase of approximately 74,000, or 15%, from approximately 494,000 as of June 30, 2020
to 568,000 as of June 30, 2021 based on our ability to attract new customers, though our Blended Churn Rate
increased from 2.8% to 3.5%, largely due to network saturation due to the high level of traffic caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the growth in the subscriber base, we also recorded an increase in the
percentage of customers that pay for EOLO Wave G (which is based on the licensed 28 GHz spectrum) as
compared to EOLO Wave (which is based on the unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum) which represented 23% and 76%
of subscribers as of June 30, 2021, respectively as compared to 14% and 85% as of June 30, 2020, respectively.
In particular, wireless services revenue increased by 15.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared
to the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by principal service line for the periods indicated.

Other income decreased by €0.2 million, or 22.2%, to €0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021
from €0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

**_Internal work capitalized. Internal work capitalized increased by €0.1 million, or 14.3%, to €0.8 million for the_**
three months ended June 30, 2021 from €0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. For the three
months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded €0.5 million related to network design and €0.3 million related to the
development of software, whereas for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded €0.3 million related to
network design and €0.4 million related to the development of software.

**_Purchases of materials and services. Purchases of materials and services increased by €3.9 million, or 21.5%, to_**
€22.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from €18.1 million for the three months ended June 30,
2020. This increase was in line with the increase in our subscriber base and revenue. Within purchases of
materials and services, the largest single components related to marketing and sales (6.1% increase in the three

months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the 2020 period primarily due to new advertising campaigns during
the quarter) and installation and maintenance (44.8% increase in 2021 as compared to 2020), due to higher cost
for maintenance of the infrastructure (BTS, core network and software) and for installation and collection of used
CPEs. As a percentage of total revenue and other income, purchases of materials and services increased to 42.0%
for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from 40.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of our purchases of materials and services for the three months

months ended June 30, 2021 from €6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase in
personnel costs for the three months ended June 30, 2021 is due to an overall increase in wages and payroll,
employee benefits and social charges due to an increase in headcount and the LTIP accrual based on the fair
value assessment carried out in 2021 (and this amount was not paid at period end). As a percentage of total
revenue and other income, personnel costs increased to 15.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from
13.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of our personnel expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020

ended June 30, 2021 from €0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. These operating costs primarily
include contingent liabilities of €0.7 million, primarily relating to costs incurred in previous years, membership
of trade associations of €0.1 million and VAT on self-invoices for giveaways of €0.1 million. As a percentage of
total revenue and other income, other operating costs increased to 1.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2021
from 0.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

€23.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from €19.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2020, primarily due to the increased investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets made
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended June 30,
2021 primarily consists of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets (related to hosting leases and leases
of property) and intangible assets (related to software and licenses). As a percentage of total revenue and other
income, depreciation and amortization increased to 45.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from 43.1%
for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

**_Impairment losses on non-current assets. Impairment losses on non-current assets increased by €0.8 million, to_**
€1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 from €0.2 million for the three months ended June 30,

**_Impairment losses on trade receivables and other financial assets. Impairment losses on trade receivables and_**
other financial assets increased by €0.1 million, or 33.3%, to €0.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021 as compared to €0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an impairment
provision of € 5.2 million related to trade receivables as of June 30, 2021 (as compared to €4.8 million as of
March 31, 2021) based on our management’s quantitative and qualitative analysis of the recoverability of trade
receivables. As a percentage of total revenue and other income, impairment losses on trade receivables and other
financial assets were stable at 0.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 0.7% for the three months
ended June 30, 2020.

**_Net financial expenses. Net financial expenses decreased by €0.2 million, or 12.5%, to €1.4 million for the three_**
months ended June 30, 2021 from €1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This change was
primarily attributable to an increase in exchange rate gains and a reduction in interest expenses on leases. As a
percentage of total revenue and other income, Net financial expenses decreased to 2.7% for the three months
ended June 30, 2021 from 3.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

**_Profit/(loss) for the period. Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was €4.4 million as compared to a_**
profit of €0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to a combination of the LTIP accrual based
on the fair value assessment carried out in 2021 (and this amount was not paid at period end) and the other
factors described above.

**_Year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020_**

**_Total revenue and other income. Total revenue and other income increased by €31.3 million, or 19.5%, to_**
€191.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 from €160.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue for the growth of our customer base. We recorded a total net
subscriber increase of 93 thousand, or 19.8%, from 469 thousand as of March 31, 2020 to 562 thousand as of
March 31, 2021 based on our ability to attract new customers, though our Blended Churn Rate increased from
10.8% to 12.5%, largely due to the pandemic which led to belt tightening by consumers and businesses, though it
remained lower than the Italian broadband market churn average of 24.2%. In addition to the growth in the
subscriber base, we also recorded an increase in the percentage of customers that pay for EOLO Wave G (which
is based on the licensed 28 GHz spectrum) as compared to EOLO Wave (which is based on the unlicensed 5 GHz
spectrum) which represented 21% and 78% of subscribers as of March 31, 2021, respectively as compared to
12% and 87% as of March 31, 2020, respectively. In particular, Wireless services revenue increased by 20.3% in
the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020.

to €76.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 from €59.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This
increase was in line with the increase in subscriber base and revenue stated above. Within purchases of materials
and services, the largest single components related to marketing and sales (+30.1% increase in 2021 as compared
to 2020) and installation and maintenance (+55.7% increase in 2021 as compared to 2020), largely explained by a
new marketing and media campaign in 2021 as well as increased maintenance activity due to higher usage of

broadband during a work-from-home and lockdown environment. As a percentage of total revenue and other
income, purchases of materials and services increased to 40.0% for the year ended March 31, 2021 from 37.3%
for the year ended March 31, 2020.

**_Personnel expenses. Personnel expenses increased by €16.2 million, or 71.2%, to €38.9 million for the year_**
ended March 31, 2021 from €22.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 despite a relatively stable
headcount of 473 as of March 31, 2021 from 455 as of March 31, 2020. This increase in personnel costs for the
year ended March 31, 2021 is due to changes in the fair value of our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which
was established on September 1, 2018 for directors, managers and employees occupying senior roles in the
business. This change in fair value is a non-cash effect. The LTIP provides for the payment of a bonus to the
beneficiaries on the basis of which the actual compensation to be paid to each beneficiary is linked to a multiplier
that is in turn correlated to the equity value of EOLO. For the March 31, 2021 fair value assessment, the EOLO’s
management took into consideration bonus payments that could be payable to LTIP beneficiaries as a result of
the change of control of EOLO, and therefore the fair value of the liability recorded under IFRS increased by
€14.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue and other income, personnel costs increased to 20.3% for the year
ended March 31, 2021 from 14.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020.

primarily due to the increased asset base as non-current assets increased from €286.2 million as of March 31,
2020 to €343.9 million as of March 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended March 31, 2021
primarily consists of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets (related to hosting leases and leases of
property) and intangible assets (related to software and licenses). As a percentage of total revenue and other

unchanged at €1.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, compared to €1.4 million for the year ended
March 31, 2020, largely due to the technological obsolescence of certain property, plant and equipment.

**_Impairment losses on trade receivables and other financial assets. Impairment losses on trade receivables and_**
other financial assets increased by €0.4 million, or 30.8%, to €1.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 as
compared to €1.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to an impairment provision amounted
to €4.8 million related to trade receivables as of March 31, 2021 (as compared to €3.2 million as of March 31,
2020) based on our management’s quantitative and qualitative analysis of the recoverability of trade receivables.

ended March 31, 2021 from €4.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This change was primarily
attributable to borrowings under our capex line, which we incurred to support infrastructure development and the
increase in exchange losses. As a percentage of total revenue and other income, Net financial expenses were
stable at 3.2% for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 3.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020.

**_Income tax gain. Income tax gain increased by €4.4 million to €4.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2021_**
from €0.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This change was largely attributable to recognition of
deferred tax timing differences. Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2021 was 14.6%, unchanged
from the previous year.

**_Profit/(loss) for the period. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2021 was €10.2 million as compared to a profit_**
of €3.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 due to a combination of the €14.3 million increase in the
accrual in respect of the potential award to senior management of one-off payments under the LTIP associated

€160.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 from €129.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This
increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue for the growth of our customer base. We recorded a total net
subscriber increase of 89 thousand, or 19.0%, from 380 thousand as of March 31, 2019 to 469 thousand as of
March 31, 2020 based on our ability to attract new customers and improve customer retention with a Blended
Churn Rate of 10.8% for the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to 11.8% for the year ended March 31,
2019. Growth of the subscriber base was recorded in all categories. In addition to the growth in the subscriber
base, we also recorded an increase in the percentage of customers that pay for EOLO Wave G (which is based on
the 28 GHz spectrum) as compared to EOLO Wave (which is based on the unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum), which
increased to 12% and 87% as of March 31, 2020 as compared to 5% and 92% of March 31, 2019. In particular,
Wireless services revenue increased by 26.4% in the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2019 while Wired services decreased by 47.1% reflecting a preference for Wireless connectivity

Following the Transactions, we expect to have €375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding, that the €125.0 million Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn and to have €40.9 million in cash
and cash equivalents. We will pay interest on the Notes quarterly in cash at an annual interest rate and on the
dates as set forth on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. Interest will accrue from the Issue Date.

Following the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are expected to consist of the
following:

Š cash generated from operating activities;

Š injections from shareholders on the Acquisition Closing Date in connection with the Transactions;

Š borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time; and

Š bilateral working capital lines.

The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will contain incurrence covenants that, among other things, limit
our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on or
make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; enter into
agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including
capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; create or incur liens; and merge,
consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. These covenants will be subject to important exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_

For more information regarding our indebtedness and cash service requirements on our indebtedness following
the Refinancing, see “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_Cash Flows_**

The table below summarizes our cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the three
months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.


**For the year ended March 31,**

_Net cash flows generated by operating activities_

Net cash flows generated by operating activities was €18.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as
compared to net cash flow of €17.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was
principally related to an improvement in our cash generation.

Net cash flows generated by operating activities was €91.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 as
compared to net cash flow of €83.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase was principally
attributable to an improvement in our cash generation.

Net cash flows generated by operating activities was €83.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 as
compared to net cash flow of €56.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This increase was principally
related to an improvement in our cash generation.

_Net cash flows used in investing activities_

Net cash flows used in investing activities was €25.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as
compared to €16.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase in cash outflow was
principally attributable to an increase in acquisition of property, plant and equipment to support the expansion of
the subscriber base related to acquisitions of customer premises equipment (CPE), installation and replacement
and base transceiver station (BTS) backhauling infrastructure.

Net cash flows used in investing activities was €92.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to
€83.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase in cash outflow was principally an increase in
acquisition of property, plant and equipment and acquisition of intangible assets.

Net cash flows used in investing activities was €83.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to
€69.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This increase in cash outflow was principally attributable to an
increase in acquisition of property, plant and equipment and acquisition of intangible assets (i.e., costs for
software and licenses and frequencies).

_Net cash flows from (used in) financing activities_

Net cash flows from (used in) financing activities was a cash inflow of €5.8 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2021 as compared to the Net cash flows from (used in) financing activities which was a cash outflow of
€4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This net cash inflow in three months ended June 30, 2021
was primarily attributable to new facilities granted to support our capital expenditures.

107


-----

Net cash flows from (used in) financing activities was a cash outflow of €21.6 million for the year ended
March 31, 2021 as compared to a cash inflow of €25.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This net cash
outflow in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in the repaid financing.

Net cash flows from (used in) financing activities was a cash inflow of €25.6 million for the year ended
March 31, 2020 as compared to a cash outflow of €17.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This was
primarily attributable to bank borrowings to support our capital expenditures.

**_Working Capital_**

We actively manage our working capital requirements to optimize and improve our capital efficiency.

Working Capital is defined as trade receivables, contract costs and other current liabilities less trade payables,
contract liabilities and other current liabilities. Our Working Capital is structurally negative as retail customers
are billed in advance on a bi-monthly basis while wholesalers are invoiced with a one month delay.

The table below sets forth our total Working Capital for the periods indicated.

**As of March 31,** **As of June 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2021** **2020** **2021**

During the periods under review, the following drove our total Working Capital:

Š **_Trade receivables. The variations in trade receivables are primarily attributable to the growth of_**
the subscriber base (and relate to wholesalers, business customers and retail customers) and, to a
certain degree, overdue receivables.

Š **_Trade payables. Trade payables are generated in connection with our capital expenditure program._**
Typically we pay suppliers between 60 to 90 days. We typically hold a stock of CPEs in our
warehouse pending their deployment, approximately three to six months’ supply in order to fulfill
new subscriber installation requests.

Š **_Contract costs and liabilities. Contract costs are mainly composed of sales commissions and_**
installation of re-used CPE from churned customers, which according to IFRS, are deferred over a
two-year period. Contract liabilities mainly include activation fees charged to customers and
reversed in the statement of profit and loss and comprehensive income over a two-year period and
connectivity services charged in advance to customers. Contract liabilities increased less than
proportionally than revenues over the periods under review as the portion of customers paying one
year in advance is progressively falling (currently, and in line with the trend of the sector,
customers are largely paying two months in advance).

Š **_Other current assets and other current liabilities. Other assets include prepaid expenses,_**
personnel-related liabilities, tax balances and have remained relatively stable over the periods
under review, excluding the reduction of grants to be collected from Infratel (a division of the
Ministry of Economic Development) as a contribution for the development of a FWA network in
certain Italian regions and the corresponding reduction of the deferred income for such grants that
is reversed in the statement of profit and loss and comprehensive income over the depreciation
period of the related investments.

During the periods under review, the following drove our capital expenditures:

Š **_Acquisitions of intangible assets. The variations in acquisitions of intangible assets largely corresponds to_**
acquisitions and development of software and licenses for the management of products and processes within
our business.

Š **_Acquisition of property, plant and equipment. The variations in acquisitions of property, plant and_**
equipment can be divided into three principal components: (i) network plant and machinery related to the
purchases of radios, antennae, servers and other networking equipment we use to build our network
infrastructure as well as personnel expenses related to employees who carry out the design of network
infrastructure, (ii) network assets on loan for use corresponding to CPEs provided to connect customer
premises to our network and (iii) tangible fixed assets in progress and down payments corresponding to
CPEs that we have purchased to support the development of our infrastructure network and which will be
installed at customer premises.

In addition, management tracks and reports Adjusted Capital Expenditures which consist of capital expenditures
recorded under IFRS as above, plus certain operating expenditure related to CPEs which cannot, due to IFRS
rules, be capitalized as they do not relate to the acquisition and installation of new CPEs but rather installation
and refurbishment-related expenditure related to CPEs from churned customers that are redeployed for new
customers. This presentation of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures, which differ from the one above presented
under IFRS, are designed to provide investors with additional granularity regarding expenditures by asset class
and purpose, meaning the main cost items relevant to our business, (i) fiber, (ii) BTS, (iii) CPEs, (iv) installation
and (v) other, corresponding to sundry expenditure and by purpose (i) growth and (ii) CCB. See “Summary
_Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—Other Financial Information and As Adjusted Data.”_

The table below sets forth our Adjusted Capital Expenditures by Asset Class for the periods indicated.

The table below sets forth our Adjusted Capital Expenditures by Purpose for the periods indicated.


**For the year ended March 31,**


**For the three months**
**ended June 30,**


**2019** **2020** **2021** **2020** **2021**

**(millions of €)**

**Adjusted Capital Expenditures by Purpose . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **88.7** **91.8** **122.8** **28.9** **36.2**

(1) Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures are aimed at expanding our customer base and network coverage and increasing our data
capacity. They relate to:

a) CPEs which are installed only after the execution of a new contract with the client. If the client decides to terminate the contract, we
charge a penalty to retrieve CPEs from a customer’s premises. The amount only includes capital expenditures invested for
successful installations;

b) BTS which are spent only after a network planning process has been established; and

c) Increase data capacity.

(2) Current Customer Base (“CCB”) Adjusted Capital Expenditures relate to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base
(e.g. maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling toward 28GHz spectrum) and replacing churned customers with new
activations.

As a result of the factors discussed above under “—Results of Operations—Three months ended June 30, 2021
_compared to the three months June 30, 2020,” our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) decreased from_
€14.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to €2.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021.
The decrease of our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) was mainly driven by:

Š _Post COVID-19 effect: in the three months ended June 30, 2020, we experienced significant_
subscriber growth driven by lockdown measures and increased demand of connectivity for smart
working, distance learning and TV streaming, with relatively low advertising and marketing spend
during such period. However, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded lower
customer additions on the back of a temporarily stagnant market as a result of the gradual
loosening of lockdown restrictions in Italy. This resulted in slower relative growth in total
revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. The entire Italian BB market recorded lower
subscriber growth during this period in 2021. By way of example, during the three months ended
December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, subscriber net adds (i.e., the
number of new subscribers minus churned customers) for the Italian BB market (only including
TIM, Fastweb, Vodafone and EOLO) were 201,000 and 173,000 respectively, compared to 53,000
in the three months ended June 30, 2021.

Š _Adjusted Capital Expenditures: during the three months ended June 30, 2021, we incurred a_
higher amount of Adjusted Capital Expenditures compared to the same period in the prior year
(€36.2 million compared to €28.9 million). This increase was driven by (a) investments aimed at
improving our network infrastructure, mainly as a result of the agreement signed in 2021 with
Open Fiber to secure an additional 1,000 FTTA links; and (b) investments in BTS and CPE to
increase our capacity and warehouse inventory in anticipation of the school re-opening in the fall
as we typically do each year, other than in respect of the three months ended June 30, 2020, when
the supply chain delays caused by COVID-19 led us to delay these investments. Our CCB
Adjusted Capital Expenditures increased from €12.9 million for the three months ended June 30,
2020 to €22.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 due primarily to the allocation to
CCB of the majority of the previously mentioned acceleration in network improvement and
warehouse build up and because we had a larger customer base compared to the same period in
the prior year. Our Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures on the other hand decreased for the
three months ended June 30, 2021 from €16.0 million to €14.2 million due to the lower net adds
(7,300 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 25,500), which partially offset by
the aforementioned investments in capacity expansion.

We expect that these effects on our cashflow generation and composition of CCB Adjusted Capital Expenditures
versus Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures will normalize during the rest of the year ended March 31, 2022
following an expected increase in new subscriptions as we typically experience during the school re-opening
season and the gradual utilization of the additional capacity built during the three months ended June 30, 2021.
See “Forward-looking Statements.”

110


-----

More generally, we expect our Adjusted Capital Expenditures for the year ending March 31, 2022 to be
consistent with the year ended March 31, 2021. See “Forward-looking Statements.”

**_Contractual Obligations_**

As of June 30, 2021, EOLO had bank loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities in the amount of
€133.9 million, of which €101.2 million related to non-current loans and borrowing and €32.7 million related to
current loans, borrowings and other financial liabilities. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization” for more
information on the Refinancing.

As of June 30, 2021, on as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our main contractual obligations
will be repayment of the Notes in 2028 and the Revolving Credit Facility which will mature six months prior to
the maturity of the Notes offered hereby. We will also have to make regular lease payments and make scheduled
payments on bilateral lines.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Commitments_**

Other than off-balance sheet bank guarantees amounting to €6.3 million as of March 31, 2021, the majority of
which relates to a guarantee in favor of Intracom S.A. (a key supplier) for the acquisition of radio antennae, we
have no significant off-balance sheet commitments.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks**

The following presents a brief discussion of market risks inherent in our business.

**_Credit Risk_**

We are subject to exposure to potential losses resulting from a default by subscribers, especially with respect to
our retail customers who comprise the majority of our subscribers. Credit risk is not concentrated given the
diffuse subscriber base and our presence in various regions of Italy. Trade receivable balances are monitored on a
continuous basis and our exposure to bad debt has not been significant for the periods under review and
appropriate allowances are made for doubtful accounts.

The following table sets forth the accounting value of our trade receivables as of the dates indicated.

**As of March 31,**

**2019** **2020** **2021**

**(millions of €)**

Our agreements with customers permit us to cut service in the event of two months of non-payment, which
reduces our credit risk. Most of our unpaid trade receivables are related to deactivation costs, namely penalties
that customers are obliged to pay if they break their subscription contracts before the two-year commitment
during which they benefitted from a discount (with the deactivation fee being equal to the difference between the
regular price and the discount received). As our customer base increases, even with a relatively stable churn,
unpaid trade receivables tend to increase in absolute terms, though unpaid trade receivables have not materially
increased as a percentage of total trade receivables during the periods under review. We pursue collections of
unpaid trade receivables through our internal credit recovery department and undue trade receivables are written
off following five years of non-payment in accordance with the prescription requirements of the Italian Civil
Code.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Our financial liabilities mainly include borrowings and trade and other debts. These liabilities may expose us to
liquidity risk in the event of early repayment or short maturity. Following the Transactions, in order to manage
our liquidity risk, we intend to rely on cash generated from operating activities, bilateral working capital lines
and the Revolving Credit Facility for an appropriate amount and maturity to ensure that we have adequate
available funds to execute our business plan.

111


-----

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations as any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest
rates at floating rates that could increase, increasing our debt service obligations thereunder. Borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest indexed to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”),
adjusted periodically, plus a margin. EURIBOR may increase significantly in the future, resulting in additional
interest expense for us to the extent we draw down on the Revolving Credit Facility, reducing the free cash flow
for investments and limiting our ability to service our indebtedness. Although we are not required to nor do we
currently intend to enter into hedging derivatives with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, we may elect to
do so in the future.

**_Exchange Rate Risk_**

All of our operations are in Italy and therefore we have limited exchange rate risks as our revenue is exclusively
generated in euro and most of our costs are incurred in euro. From time to time, we may purchase certain
specialized equipment and procure services from non-Italian suppliers with contracts denominated in currencies
other than the euro (primarily the U.S. dollar), but such purchases are not a significant component of our cost
structure.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition, and results of operations are based upon our audited
financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and
related interpretations (SIC/IFRIC), endorsed by the European Union and in force at the reporting date, and the
measures issued to implement article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/2005. The preparation of this financial
information requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below
have the greatest potential impact on our financial information, therefore we consider these to be our critical
accounting policies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the
estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies described below.

The areas that require significant estimates and judgements in the preparation of the financial statements are:

      - identification of performance obligations and the term of contracts with customers, note Revenue
_from contracts with customers;_

      - the period of time over which the incremental costs to obtain a contract and to fulfil a contract are
expensed, note Revenue from contracts with customers;

      - the useful life of property, plant and equipment, note Property, plant and equipment;

      - impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, note Property, plant and equipment;

      - right-of-use assets, note Leases;

      - the lease term depending on whether the company is reasonably certain it will exercise the
extension option, note Leases ;

      - the fair value of share-based payments, note Share-based payments;

      - provisions and contingent liabilities, note Provisions.

Management checks the estimates and judgements regularly. They are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations about future events that could have an impact on EOLO’s financial position and are
considered reasonable in the circumstances.

**_Revenue from contracts with customers_**

EOLO applies IFRS 15 to recognize revenue from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is
recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of
control - at a point in time or over time - requires judgement.

112


-----

IFRS 15 requires that revenue be recognized using a five-step model:

Š identify the contract(s) with a customer;

Š identify the performance obligations in the contract;

Š determine the transaction price;

Š allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

Š recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

_Performance obligations and revenue recognition criteria_

The process underlying EOLO’s recognition of revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 is summarized below:

Š the contract is identified when the parties approve the contract and identify their rights and obligations,
_i.e., when the contract becomes legally binding;_

Š the duration of the contract with customer has been defined on the basis of the contract term agreed
with the customer (mainly 24 months);

Š EOLO has identified a single performance obligation for its connectivity services; it does not account
for the performance obligations related to the other services provided with its connectivity services
separately, as their separate accounting would not alter how it recognizes revenue;

Š the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the customer, including any
promotions, covering the entire contract term.

Š EOLO allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling price. Revenue from nonrefundable up-front activation fees, which do not constitute a
separate performance obligation and do not convey a material right to customers, is deferred over the
contract term;

Š EOLO recognizes revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. It usually invoices
revenues and collects payment on a two-month basis in advance.

Contracts with non-business customers generally provide for advance payment, which is not considered a
significant financing component given that advance payment is normal business practice and average payments
are usually made over less than 12 months.

_Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil a contract_

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract, comprising commissions paid to agents and brokers, are
recognized in profit or loss over the contract term (24 months).

The costs to fulfil a contract, including the cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio
transceiver at a new customer, are recognized over the contract term (24 months). The costs of initial installation
are recognized in “Property, plant and equipment”.

Should the contract be terminated, the incremental costs of obtaining the contract and the costs to fulfil it are
expensed.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

_Initial recognition_

Property, plant and equipment are recognized and measured at cost as established by IAS 16. Therefore, they are
recognized at their purchase or production cost, including directly attributable costs and subsequently adjusted
for accumulated depreciation, any accumulated impairment losses and/or reversals of impairment losses. If
significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

113


-----

Land is not depreciated, even when it is acquired together with a building. The gain or loss on the sale of
property, plant, machinery, equipment or other assets is determined as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized in profit or loss in the period of the
derecognition.

_Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure and the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment are added
to the item’s carrying amount and capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
with the related item increase. All other costs are expensed when incurred.

When the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment is capitalized, the carrying
amount of the parts that are replaced is expensed.

The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is
capitalized and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed
when incurred.

_Depreciation_

Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of
the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is
derecognized. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the
item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and
reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based
on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its
estimated realizable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant
part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates:

Š Buildings 3%
Š Network systems and equipment 10% - 20%
Š Assets under free loan 20% - 50%

Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use EOLO’s connectivity services
and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the related
contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet depreciated is
expensed

These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are
installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated.

Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment.

When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when
there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant
obsolescence, EOLO compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the present
value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary. If the conditions for the recognition of the
impairment loss are no longer valid in subsequent years, the loss is reversed up to the carrying amount the asset
would have had (net of depreciation) had the impairment loss never been recognized.

_Impairment losses on non-financial assets_

When a non-financial asset shows indication of impairment at the reporting date, EOLO estimates its recoverable
amount, defined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, applying the following
definitions:

Š Value in use: this is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or
cash-generating unit (CGU). Specifically, the asset will generate cash flows, which will be discounted
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the asset. The cash flows are determined using internal business plans based on detailed

114


-----

budgets and calculations prepared separately for each asset/cash-generating unit. The budgets do not
include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a
horizon of a maximum of five years.

Š Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. EOLO uses valuation models based
on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators.

**_Leases_**

IAS 36 does not require a formal estimate of the recoverable amount if there are no indicators of impairment. The
exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business
combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment.

When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, EOLO recognizes a loss equal to the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, EOLO checks
whether the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if not, estimates the
asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of goodwill, if, and only if,
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last
impairment loss was recognized. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in prior
years. The reversal is recognized through profit or loss.

At the lease commencement date, EOLO recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use
asset is initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. EOLO measures the
lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted
using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, EOLO uses its incremental
borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect interest,
reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments resulting
from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the amounts expected to be
payable under a residual value guarantee or when EOLO changes its assessment of an option to purchase the
underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of
the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been
reduced to zero.

EOLO’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to:

Š physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals;

Š multi-year rights to use fiber optic sections (dark fiber IRU);

Š office buildings;

Š company cars;

Š data center equipment and other assets (canteen equipment).

EOLO elected not to recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying asset is of
low value. Therefore, it recognizes the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.

EOLO assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under the new definition of IFRS 16, which establishes
that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration.

It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components
from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease
components as a single lease component.

115


-----

EOLO recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in the statement of financial
position. EOLO recognizes right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in the
specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease liabilities” in the statement of
financial position.

EOLO has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the reasonable
certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the carrying amount
of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. It measures the right-of-use asset considering the amount of the
lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the date of initial recognition.

EOLO depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the
lease term, unless the lease transfers title to the underlying asset at the end of the lease term or, given the cost of
the right-of-use asset, EOLO expects to exercise the purchase option. In this case, EOLO depreciates the
right-of-use asset over its useful life determined using the same criteria as per property, plant and equipment.

Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognized in accordance with IAS 36—
Impairment of assets.

**_Share-based payments_**

Cash-settled share-based payment plans are part of the remuneration package of the beneficiaries. Therefore, the
cost is the fair value of the instruments recognized under “Personnel expenses” over the period from the award
date to the settlement date, with an increase in the related liability.

EOLO remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with any
changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

The cost of the liability is recognized using the same criteria for the liability set out above.

**_Provisions_**

EOLO recognizes a provision when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event
that can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation.

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

The discount rates do not reflect the risks for which future cash flows have been adjusted.

EOLO regularly reviews the provisions to reflect changes in the estimate of the costs, the payment/settlement
timing and the discount rate. Changes in the estimates are recognized in the same caption of the statement of
profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the provision or, when the liability relates to an item of
property, plant and equipment, as a balancing entry to the related asset.

Provisions include accruals for future costs of ongoing disputes and the present value of the costs to be incurred
to restore land used under lease.

**Italy—Key Economic Indicators**

**_GDP trends_**

Italy is the fourth largest economy in Europe, with a gross domestic product (“GDP”) equal to € 1,478 billion in
2020, ranking behind Germany (€2,847 billion), France (€ 2,074 billion) and the United Kingdom (€ 1,724
billion).

During the period between 2015 and 2019, Italy’s GDP grew at a 2.0% CAGR, with the most important sectors
in terms of growth over this period being (i) Trade, Transport & Accommodation, (ii) Manufacturing and
(iii) ICT (i.e., Information and Communications Technologies). In 2020, all of these sectors were heavily
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a GDP decrease of 8.9% compared to 2019, except for the ICT sector,
which grew by 1.9%, affirming this sector’s key role in driving the country’s growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the Italian economy in 2020 generally was in line with the European
average. During the first six months of 2021, Italian GDP resumed growing to 7.7 % against the average for
major Western European economies of 6.5% (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom),
demonstrating its resilience. It is expected that the Italian economy will recover fully from the COVID-19
pandemic’s impact by 2023 in terms of GDP.

**_Population and Households_**

In 2020 Italy had approximately 59.6 million inhabitants and, despite a slight decrease in population since 2014,
the number of households has increased as the number of members per family is declining due to ongoing social
changes (e.g., trends to live alone longer and marry later) and decline in birth rates.

Despite the increase in number of households, the urbanization trend in Italy has not accelerated and the portion
of the population living in cities has remained stable at 35% between 2016 and 2019. While there has been a
decrease in the number of people living in rural areas, this has been compensated for by an increase in the
number of citizens established in towns and suburbs (from 41% of the total population in 2016 to 47% in 2019).
Between 2016 and 2019, the level of the average disposable income increased in rural and suburban areas: at a
3% CAGR in rural areas (from €16,700 to €18,200), 2% CAGR in towns and suburbs (from €18,100 to €19,200)
and 1% CAGR in cities (from €19,700 to €20,600), confirming that the urbanization trend remained stable over
the period from 2016-2019. Given the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social and work styles, it
can be expected that some workers will seek to spend more time outside cities with the growing trend towards
remote working.

**_Italian Recovery and Resilience Plan (“RRP”)_**

On July 13, 2021, the EU Council approved Italy’s €191.5 billion Recovery and Resilience Plan (the “RRP”),
which consists of €68.9 billion in grants and €122.6 billion in loans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility.
The Italian government estimates that the RRP may boost GDP by 3.6% between 2021 and 2026.

Under the RRP, the Italian government allocated €40.32 billion to Mission 1 (Digitalization, Innovation,
Competitiveness, Culture and Tourism), of which €23.89 billion was allocated to the sub-mission focused on
Digitalization, Innovation and Competitiveness of the Productive System; within this sub-mission, €6.71 billion
was allocated to investments in ultra-fast network (UBB and 5G). In particular, a large portion of these
€6.71 billion was allocated to an initiative (“Italy 1 Gbps”) with the objective to bring 1 Gbps connectivity to
8.5 million households and enterprises located in Grey and Black areas with the principle of technological
neutrality by 2026. However, only Grey areas will be concretely involved, as Open Fiber and FiberCop have
declared to cover Black areas. In Italy, FTTH and FWA are the only technologies eligible to accomplish the
technological and performance requirement. As the FTTH roll out by Open Fiber has experienced significant
delays, FWA could benefit from the expected plan to implement the “Italy 1 Gbps” initiative by 2026, thus
making EOLO an eligible beneficiary. EOLO, the main FWA operator in the Grey and White areas, with its
infrastructure network, leading technology and knowledge of these areas, could be successful in tenders for
public funding under such initiative.

**Italian Telecommunication and Broadband Markets**

The Italian telecommunications services market is Europe’s fourth largest, with annual service revenues
(excluding pay-TV and OTT Video) of €20.5 billion in 2020, according to Ovum. Fixed-line service revenues
accounted for €7.95 billion and comprise growing broadband revenues and declining voice revenues.

Broadband spending by Italian Households has been lower than in other European countries in absolute terms,
with the average monthly broadband spending per HH of €22.5 in Italy in 2019, compared to a European average
of €27.8. However, the Italian broadband spending level is in line with other European countries in terms of share
of disposable income. Internet usage and cloud adoption levels in Italy are also lower than in other European
countries with a significant gap between urban areas and suburban and rural areas. Supported by the RRP backed
resources, Italy has announced plans to invest in ICT and digitalization to close the gap in internet usage.

**Internet Usage by Degree of Urbanization 2019 - % of Area Population**

_Eurostat_

Internet usage in Italy is expected to continue to grow, in part due to the trend of increasing data consumption.
Secular trends, such as the increasing use of online shopping, online banking applications, video-on-demand as well
as gaming and video activities, are expected to drive the growth in data traffic demand. The social distancing
measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the ensuing changes in work and life habits
(such as remote working and use of virtual social interaction methods) have boosted the adoption and use of these
online applications and shown the importance of the internet as the primary communication medium of choice.

(1) broadband access at fixed location, for one household. Technologies included are both wireline and wireless (FWA).

Data consumption occurs via either mobile or fixed connections, with the fixed connections accounting for the
vast majority of data consumption. In 2020, for example, out of 24 EB (Exabyte) (or 25,769,803,776 GB) of total
data traffic in Italy, 82% was accessed via fixed connections. Fixed data traffic per household is expected to
continue growing at a CAGR of 25.7% over the period 2021 to 2024.

**EU and Italian National UBB Plans**

In 2010, the EU Commission issued the communication, the “Digital Agenda for Europe” (the “DAE
**Communication”), which set forth long-term EU strategies for broadband. The DAE set non-binding targets on**
broadband coverage and take-up to be achieved by 2020:

‰ 100% of EU citizens should have access to broadband coverage of 30 Mbps and above; and

50% of EU households should have access to broadband speeds to 100 Mbps and above

In September 2016, the EU Commission issued the Communication, “Connectivity for a Competitive Digital
Single Market—Towards a European Gigabit Society Gigabit Society” (the “2016 Gigabit Society
**Communication”), in which the following non-binding targets for the 2025 were set:**

‰ connectivity of 1 Gbps (upload and download) for all socio-economic entities (i.e., schools,
businesses, public administration);

‰ connectivity of 100 Mbps download for all European households and businesses; and

‰ uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and major terrestrial transport routes (as an
interim target, 5G should be commercially available in at least one major city in each EU
Member State by 2020).

Italy has developed a National UBB Plan in line with the targets set forth in the 2016 Gigabit Society
Communication with the aim of providing fast connectivity to all of its citizens. MED implements the measures
set forth in the National UBB Plan through Infratel Italia (Infrastrutture e Telecomunicazioni per l’Italia S.p.A.).
Infratel Italia is an “in-house” company of the MED and part of the Invitalia Group.

The main objectives of National UBB Plan include to guarantee coverage of at least 30 Mbps to all citizens and a
minimum of 100 Mbps to 85% of the Italian population by 2020. In order to achieve the National UBB plan
targets, Infratel deployed directly the UBB network in several Italian municipalities and launched three public
tenders relating to the development of a network for UBB services in approximately 7,500 municipalities in 19
regions:

‰ in the first tender, Open Fiber was granted in 2017 all 5 lots in the 6 regions involved
(Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Tuscany, Abruzzo and Molise), consisting of around
3,000 municipalities;

‰ in the second tender, Open Fiber was granted in 2019 all 6 lots in the 10 regions involved
(Piedmont, Valle d’Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Marche, Umbria, Lazio, Campania,
Basilicata and Sicily) and the Autonomous Province of Trento, approximately 3,700
municipalities; and,

‰ in the third tender, Open Fiber was granted in 2019 all 3 lots in the 3 regions involved (Puglia,
Calabria and Sardinia), approximately 880 municipalities.

121


-----

On March 9, 2021, the EU Commission published its “Digital Compass” strategy. The Digital Compass
highlights the EU’s focus on four areas:

‰ Digital Skills—By 2030, the EU aims for at least 80% of citizens to have basic digital skills,
and for Europe to have 20 million ICT specialists;

‰ Secure and reliable digital infrastructure—The EU intends that gigabit connectivity and 5G
should be widely available across Europe; Europe also aims to produce 20% of the world’s
semi-conductors;

‰ Digitalization of business—By 2030, the EU expects that three out of four EU companies
should use cloud computing services, big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI); most SMEs
should achieve a basic level of digitalization; and

‰ Digitalization of public services—By 2030, the EU aims to have all key public services
available online; all citizens should have access to their e-medical records; and 80% of citizens
should use an e-ID.

**Italian Fixed Broadband Infrastructure**

In the Italian market, fixed broadband services rely primarily on copper, fiber and wireless networks. In Italy,
coaxial cable network infrastructure has not been developed.

_Copper_

Copper (xDSL) has the largest coverage in the Italian market, with 99.6% of Italian households covered, in line
with the EU-5 average coverage of 99.0% (2019). The Italian telecommunications incumbent, Telecom Italia
SpA (“TIM”), owns the majority of the nationwide copper (xDSL) network and offers broadband access to
16.6 million households, while having a direct retail market share of around 42.2%, or 7.8 million customers.
TIM also offers another approximately 7.8 million wholesale accesses.

_Fiber_

The fiber network in Italy is still at an early stage with a coverage of only 30.4% of Italian households as
compared to a European average of 41%. It is expected that Italy will reach a fiber coverage level similar to other
European countries by 2030 or so. In Italy, the main operators of the fiber network include Open Fiber, FiberCop
and Fastweb. Open Fiber was formed in December 2015 by Enel S.p.A. and CDP (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, an
Italian government investment fund) and secured financing of €7 billion with a target to connect 19 million
Italian households with FTTH accesses by the end of 2020. As of the end of September 2020, Open Fiber passed
11.6 million homes with FTTH. Open Fiber is a pure wholesaler to telecommunications services providers such
as Vodafone, Wind 3 and Tiscali. Open Fiber has been awarded the three tenders granted by Infratel for the
creation of a UBB infrastructure for an overall White area coverage plan of approximately 8.4 million of property
units (the coverage in the original plan was 9.5 million), of which 6.2 million of property units (the coverage in
the original plan was 7.9 million) will be covered by FTTH and 2.2 million will be covered by FWA (the
coverage in the original plan was 1.6 million). Since the awards of the three Infratel tenders, Open Fiber
increased the FWA proportion to 26%. In addition, it is reported that Open Fiber has completed coverage of only
22.6% of the targeted FTTH municipalities and only 3.6% for FWA due to higher costs and longer deployment
times than initially expected; the original announced plan was to achieve 100% coverage by December 2020.

FiberCop was formed by TIM in early 2021 and is owned by TIM (58%), KKR (37.5%) and Fastweb (4.5%).
FiberCop operates TIM’s secondary network (from the street cabinet to customers’ homes) and the fiber network
developed by FlashFiber, the joint venture between TIM (80%) and Fastweb (20%). FiberCop’s announced aim
is to become the largest infrastructure wholesaler in Italy, connecting 56% or 14 million of all technical units
(residential or business sites which have had a fixed line connection in the last 10 years, corresponding to
approximately 5 million occupied premises based on ISTAT) as of the end of 2025. See—“Technologies used in
_the Italian FBB market—FTTC (Fiber-to-the-Cabinet).” and “Technologies used in the Italian FBB market—_
_FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home).”_

_Fixed Wireless Access (FWA)_

Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) technology uses a hybrid system composed of wired fiber-to-the-antenna and
wireless access networks to offer fixed broadband and ultra-broadband services. FWA had a coverage of Italian
Households of 72% in 2019 and the main operators of FWA networks in Italy are EOLO and Linkem.

122


-----

EOLO owns, leases and operates a proprietary end-to-end FWA infrastructure network and also operates as a
wholesaler, offering its excess capacity to other operators. It has recently signed a partnership agreement with
Wind 3 and announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM to grow its wholesale offering. Other
operators that offer their FWA network on a wholesale basis include OpenFiber and Linkem. However, EOLO is
the main wholesale provider in its Target Addressable Market. See—“Technologies used in the Italian FBB
_market—FWA (Fixed Wireless Access).”_

**The Italian Fixed Broadband Market**

**_Overview_**

The Italian fixed broadband (“FBB”) market comprised 18.37 million active lines as of March 2021 and is
characterized by continued growth and increasing demand for high-speed broadband internet services. Fixed
broadband connections grew at a 4% CAGR (between 2015 and March 2021) with the natural demand evolution
towards high-speed internet services resulting in strong penetration of ultra-broadband (“UBB”) connections
(30Mbps or higher speed) reaching approximately 67% of total lines as of March 2020 (as compared to 8% of
total lines as of March 2015).

_Source: AGCOM_

The penetration of Italian FBB services as a percentage of total households has grown from 57% in 2015 to 69%
in 2020, but the Italian FBB market remains underpenetrated as compared to a European average penetration of
87% in 2019. The penetration of FBB services varies across Italy, with suburban and rural areas showing lower
penetration (between 56% and 60%) as compared to Black and Grey I Areas (between 66% and 81%),
particularly for high-speed connections (100 Mbps or higher), which represent a smaller proportion of total
subscriptions (less than 8%) as compared to a national average of 51.3% as of December 2020. The lower highspeed internet penetration in rural and suburban areas is partly due to the fact that these areas are serviced (in
addition to FWA connections) through legacy ADSL and FTTC connections which have proven to be ineffective
in delivering high-speed connections in areas with challenging topography and low population density. Italian
current broadband penetration gap versus other European countries is expected to be offset in the next ten years,
with FWA playing a crucial role where no FTTH coverage is expected.

123


-----

The Italian territory has been divided into different areas, based upon the existing or expected future UBB
technology competition in such areas, into Black, Grey (I and II) and White (I and II) areas.

_ADSL_

DSL uses basic telephone infrastructure to access the internet. DSL technology leverages the fact that copper
wires used in telephone networks have a much higher bandwidth (7 MHz) than that required for normal voice
conversation (3.4 KHz). See—“Italian Fixed Broadband Infrastructure—Copper.” DSL utilizes the extra
bandwidth to provide broadband internet connections. The most commonly used variant of DSL is ADSL, which
was designed on the basis that internet users normally receive or download significantly more information than
they send or upload. ADSL connections normally have three to four times more bandwidth for downloading,
providing download speeds of up to 30 Mbps with a latency of 10ms on average. However, as copper is a
distance-sensitive medium, access speeds for DSL technology decrease substantially as the distance from DSL
hubs increases.

Historically, ADSL was the predominant FBB distribution platform in Italy and accounted for 85.9% of FBB
connections in 2015. However, the market share of ADSL has been consistently eroded by upgraded FTTC
connections and, more recently, by better performing technologies, such as FTTH and FWA. This has resulted in
a decline in ADSL market share to 27.3% as of March 2021.

_FTTC (Fiber-to-the-Cabinet)_

FTTC is a hybrid technology as it links the street cabinets with regional and national POPs as well as with data
centers with fiber optic connections, while the so called “last mile” between the cabinet and the households/
premises is linked through telephone network copper wires. FTTC allows internet speeds up to 100 Mbps.

125


-----

However, the performance of FTTC is highly dependent on the length of the copper wire (i.e., the distance
between the house and the local hub/cabinet), with speeds decreasing to approximately 30Mbps for households
located more than one kilometer from the nearest cabinet. The average latency (the time it takes to send data and
receive a response) for FTTC is 5 milliseconds (ms) (as compared to 0 – 1 ms for FTTH and 1 ms for FWA).

TIM controls the majority of ADSL and FTTC coverage in Italy, with a small portion of such coverage held by
Vodafone and Fastweb. Over the last few years, TIM focused its fixed network capital expenditures mainly on
upgrading households from ADSL to FTTC, which led to a significant growth of FTTC’s market share from
7.4% in 2015 to 52.4% as of March 2021 of Italian FBB connections. However, FTTC is expected to be
gradually replaced by better performing new technologies such as FTTH and FWA.

The ADSL and FTTC legacy technologies are the dominant technologies in EOLO’s Target Addressable Market,
with market shares in 2020 of 39.3% and 50.0%, respectively, in Grey II areas, and 62.5% and 25.0%,
respectively, in White II areas. In White I areas, FTTC is not deployed and ADSL had a 78.3% market share in
2020.

_FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home)_

In Italy, FTTH is currently viewed as the leading broadband technology in terms of speed, latency and reliability.
A FTTH connected house has a fiber optic cable between the cabinet and the regional and national POPs and data
centers, and a fiber optic connection between the cabinet and the household/premise. FTTH connections provide
speeds of up to 1Gbps (and faster), while the performance is not affected by the distance between the households
and the cabinet. FTTH’s latency is approximately 0-1ms on average. Due to its high deployment costs, rolling
out FTTH technology is generally economically viable only in densely populated areas where it is possible to
achieve economies of scale and is suboptimal in rural or even suburban areas. However, given political support
(at both the EU and Italian government levels) for the FTTH rollout in Italy and the availability of public
subsidies, FTTH is announced to be rolled out even in rural areas. However, it may be the case that the FTTH
rollout in rural areas will be limited due to the Italian government’s limited financial resources (despite the RRP)
and Open Fiber’s focus on more economically viable areas. As a result, FTTH, is not expected to be rolled out in
Grey II and White II areas and is expected to be rolled out in White I areas from 2021. See—“Italian Fixed
_Broadband Infrastructure—Fiber.”_

FTTH connections currently play a very limited role in the Italian FBB market. Supported by the gradual roll out
of fiber infrastructure, FTTH connections have grown at a 45% CAGR between 2015 and March 2021 reaching a
total of 2.11 million connections (11.5%) in March 2021. In EOLO’s Target Addressable Market, as of March
2021, FTTH accounts for only 2% of total FBB connections. Given its high connectivity performance, FTTH is
expected to gradually replace ADSL and FTTC connections and gain a leading market share in Italy, except in
rural and suburban areas (including EOLO’s Core Target Addressable Market (Grey II and White II areas)).

_FWA (Fixed Wireless Access)_

FWA uses a hybrid system of wired fiber and wireless networks to offer fixed broadband and ultra-broadband
services. FWA networks offer internet access through a network of antennas and receivers. Each antenna is
linked through optical fiber to regional and national POPs as well as with data centers. Connection to households
and single premises is carried out through radiofrequencies, offering speeds in the 30-100 Mbps range (up to
1 Gbps for business clients with PTP access). FWA’s latency is 1 ms on average.

FWA providers aim to offer broadband services with higher download and upload speeds at similar or lower
prices than their competing ADSL/FTTC network providers. FWA represents the best solution to deliver highspeed connections in rural and suburban areas, as it benefits from lower installation costs and superior
marketability due to lower installation times. We estimate that in rural areas the deployment capital expenditure
required per active customer amounts to €1,300 for FTTH, compared to €608 for FWA. This lower capital
expenditure results in a significantly shorter payback period for FWA as compared to FTTH, FTTH’s costs are
also increased by its higher KO rates as compared to FWA connections in rural areas.

FWA also benefits from a superior marketability (as compared to FTTH) due to shorter installation times in rural
areas. In those White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is generally a significant time gap
between the completion of the FTTH network and availability for use by broadband operators due to the lack of
last meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates
a time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to

connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be
exploited by FWA operators. See—“Italian Fixed Broadband Infrastructure—Fixed Wireless Access (FWA).”

(1) total deployment capital expenditures (excluding grants).

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router).


Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans in White I areas are behind schedule, thereby creating an opportunity for FWA
operators to install their networks first. Based on current regulations, Open Fiber will not be required to deploy
its FWA network in those areas already covered with FWA UBB technologies by at least one other operator.

Based on these considerations, FWA can be seen as the most viable UBB alternative in EOLO’s Target
Addressable Market. FWA connections have doubled in the last five years, from 0.7 million in 2015 to
1.6 million (8.7% of total FBB active lines) in March 2021, reaching a share of our Target Addressable Market of
7.1% in Grey II areas, 21.7% in White I areas and 12.5% in White II areas in 2020. Italy is by far the European
country with the highest number of FWA connections and the highest proportion of FWA lines to FBB lines.
Given the Italian topography, population density and lack of cable infrastructure, Italy is an ideal candidate for
FWA to consolidate its position as a leading NGA technology.

_Other Technologies_


There is a variety of service providers in Italy that use alternative technologies to FBB for broadband internet
access, such as mobile broadband networks and satellite broadband technologies.

Mobile broadband services are offered by mobile network operators such as TIM, Vodafone and Wind 3 and do
not directly compete with fixed broadband technologies, including FWA, as they have different characteristics.
In general, mobile broadband technologies, including 5G, have a different network design tailored to offer
connections to mobile users with a constantly changing location and therefore offer a low data allowance, while

127


-----

FWA is designed to cope with high traffic volume per user and provide a connection between a household and a
BTS. For the time being (using 4G technology), mobile broadband data transmission speeds in rural and
suburban areas are relatively low compared to average FWA speeds and depend heavily on the proximity to the
next available mobile tower. To offer comparable FWA speeds in rural and suburban areas (using 5G
technology), a higher network densification (higher antenna density) and high investments by mobile network
operators (MNOs) would be required. Moreover, we believe that offering our excess capacity to other operators
will discourage competitors from deploying their own FWA network.

Some MNOs (such as TIM) have introduced “FWA-like” offers which are based on mobile infrastructure. While
these “FWA-like” services will be used in selected situations, they are considered sub-optimal in comparison to
FWA since they are unable to match the uncapped data allowance offered by FWA and present technical
difficulties in their implementation. For example, MNOs use the same mobile BTS for fixed and mobile
customers but mobile BTS point down to street level where the mobile user is located, while the FWA BTS point
up in order to deliver the signal with direct line of sight above the interference noise (“above the clutter”) to the
rooftop-mounted CPEs. As a consequence, since mobile BTS are not in clear line-of-sight above the interference
noise, which is much stronger at street level, mobile BTS generally end up having a relatively poorer quality of
service. Furthermore, as of today, MNOs do not use rooftop-based CPEs but rather indoor CPEs or window/
balcony mounted CPEs, which generally leads to higher signal losses (up to 50% of signal for FMBB as
compared to 30% for FWA). If MNOs aim at delivering speeds on par with FWA operators using these
“FWA-like” offers, MNOs will need to offer rooftop-based CPEs, which will require significant upfront capital
expenditure.

A number of Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellite projects have been launched recently, which offer improved
quality of service as compared to broadband technology offerings utilizing Geostationary (“GEO”) and Medium
Earth Orbit Satellites (“MEO”). However, these enhanced LEO satellite broadband technologies offer lower
quality services than FWA in terms of average speed, latency and price. Indeed, the top average speed of satellite
connections are of up to 80 Mbps with latency of 40 ms on average, much lower than the 300 Mbps speed with
1 ms latency offered by FWA. In addition, LEO satellites have significantly higher capital expenditure
requirements than FWA, with a satellite unit cost of €500,000, and the quality of signal is more adversely
affected by weather conditions as compared to FWA technology. Furthermore, rooftop CPEs must be able to
track satellites as they move, switching seamlessly from one to the next as they disappear below the horizon,
which is not always possible. As a result, satellite broadband is mainly offered in very remote areas where
alternative data transmission technologies are not available. Satellite broadband does not represent a meaningful
competitive challenge to FWA.

**_Outlook_**

_Overall FBB market_

Driven by growing data traffic and internet usage, the Italian FBB market is expected to continue to grow with
the total number of FBB subscribers expected to increase from the current 18.37 million to 24 million in 2036,
which means that FBB penetration in Italy should reach the current average of other Western European countries
(87%) by 2030 or so. This growth is expected to be driven by FTTH coverage completion (expected by
2025/2030 or so), migration of clients from legacy to better performing technologies (FTTH/FWA) and copper
decommissioning.

_FWA market_

The Italian FWA market is expected to increase from 1.6 million connections in 2021 to 4.0 million in 2036, with
penetration expected to consistently increase from 6% to 15% of the overall FBB market. The growth of FWA is
expected to be particularly strong in EOLO’s Target Addressable Market, where it is expected to grow from
1.1 million (9% of total households) to 3.7 million (33% of total households) in 2036.

**_ARPU and Churn Rates_**

The average ARPU for Italian FBB connections is €25.7 (residential) and €34.9 (business), which are the lowest
among West European countries in both the consumer segment (€35.5) and business segment (€58.3). This lower
average ARPU is largely the result of the unique conditions in the Italian FBB market where no premium price
differentiation is applied based on download speed performances.

Broadband FWA

In Italy, only EOLO and Linkem have a focus on the FWA technology. While Linkem is focused on Black and
Grey I areas, EOLO is mainly focused on rural and suburban (Grey II and White) areas. Based on public figures,
Linkem’s customer growth has shown a declining trend since 2017. Linkem also has a larger proportion of
pre-paid customers (34% in 2020) as compared to EOLO (2%). TIM’s and Vodafone’s offers are focused on
their “FWA-like” solutions based on their mobile networks. TIM’s and Vodafone’s geographic presence is
generally concentrated in Black and Grey areas.

The competitive environment is expected to become more dynamic in the future. Open Fiber continues to rollout
and activate FTTH in White I areas and to rollout FWA in White II areas. However, in White II areas Open Fiber
is required to rollout FWA in areas where this technology is not already deployed by other FWA providers. In
Grey II areas, EOLO and Linkem’s FWA services are expected to gain market share at the expense of TIM’s
FTTC. Moreover, in Grey I areas FiberCop announced to start the fiber buildout from 2023 onwards. Last, but
not least, Linkem and Fastweb have signed an agreement to jointly deploy a FWA “proprietary network” to
approximately 10 million households in Grey and White areas by 2023. However, we believe that EOLO is better
positioned to compete in these areas in its Target Addressable Market where EOLO has an advantage in its
infrastructure and technological knowledge.

**BUSINESS**

_This business section includes certain technical terms that are commonly used in our industry. We have estimated_
_certain information in this Offering Memorandum regarding market share and our position relative to our_
_competitors based on our internal data and certain extrapolations. See “Industry.”_

**Overview**

We are the largest provider of broadband (“BB”) and ultra-broadband (“UBB”) fixed-wireless access (“FWA”)
services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the second largest based on
number of subscribers with a market share of 34.7% for year ended March 31, 2021. Our mission is to close the
digital and speed divide by offering high-speed broadband connectivity services in underserved rural (i.e., White
areas) and suburban areas (i.e., Grey II areas) in Italy where alternative connection technologies are either
unavailable or significantly delayed (i.e., FTTH) or have lower speed and quality performance (i.e., ADSL or
FTTC). As a result, we mainly focus on identified rural and suburban areas comprising approximately
11.5 million households in Italy where the penetration of broadband connection services is lower than in the rest
of Italy and where we offer the highest available speed (our “Target Addressable Market” or “TAM”). Our
unique FWA infrastructure platform enables us to offer in our Target Addressable Market, in a cost-effective
manner, speeds of up to 100 Mbps (download speed) and we are working to increase connection speeds to 300
Mbps in the near future to further distinguish our service offer. With selected business customers, we already
offer speeds of up 1 Gbps (download speed) through point-to-point (“PTP”) wireless link connections. In recent
years, we have aggressively expanded our FWA network coverage to reach more than 80% of households in our
Target Addressable Market and more than 6,700 municipalities across Italy’s 20 regions. This resulted in a strong
growth of our subscriber base from approximately 379,600 as of March 31, 2019 to 567,900 as of June 30, 2021,
with a CAGR of 19.6%. Our market share in our Target Addressable Market was 51.5% of FWA connections as
of March 31, 2021.

We own, lease and operate a unique proprietary end-to-end infrastructure network that enables us to offer a highquality service to our customers. Our FWA infrastructure covers the complete end-to-end core, distribution and
access networks of the fixed data transmission chain.

**EOLO’S END TO END INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK**

‰ _Core Network. Our core network leverages on four core national points of presence (“POP”),_
five core regional POP and two data centers connected through our backbone. Our backbone is
secured by long-term indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”) of third parties’ dark fiber
infrastructure of approximately 14,800 kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more
than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018);

‰ _Distribution Network. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links._
As of March 31, 2021, our fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition,
in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 fiber-to-the-antenna links to
base transceiver stations (“BTS”) (i.e., fiber-to-the-antenna). As of March 31, 2021, we have
approximately 3,600 radio links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately +41%
compared to March 31, 2018); and

‰ _Access Network. As of August 31, 2021, our access network is based on approximately 3,400_
BTS (an increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018), which deliver signal

to the customer premises equipment (the “CPE”), installed on customers’ premises, primarily
using (i) the unlicensed 5GHz spectrum (for our 30 Mbps EOLO Wave offering) and (ii) the
licensed 28 GHz spectrum (for our advanced, higher speed 100 Mbps EOLO Wave G offering).

Our external network of approximately 1,500 technicians (known as “installers”) across Italy provides us with
in-depth local knowledge and a capillary presence in our Target Addressable Market, which in turn is
instrumental to our ability to offer high service levels.

As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network
that is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We offer our excess capacity on a wholesale basis to other
operators who can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to acquire new customers or migrate customers currently served
through non-performing technologies in Italian rural and suburban areas. Building on this strategy, in 2020 we
signed an agreement with Wind 3 and in 2021 announced a memorandum of understanding with TIM; these
strategic partnership projects are focused on our Target Addressable Market, where TIM and Wind 3 will be able
to provide internet access services to their existing and new customers using our proprietary infrastructure
network.

We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth,
particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of coaxial cable infrastructure, delays in fiber
roll-out and difficult geographic terrain, only approximately 67% of Italian households as of December 31, 2019
had a fixed broadband connection as compared to a European average penetration rate of approximately 87% as
of December 31, 2019. Broadband connection services, principally through FWA technology in rural and
suburban areas, are expected to continue to expand and close this penetration gap on the back of growing data
consumption driven by changing consumer habits (such as remote working) and the growing use of online
streaming, which trend has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We believe that there is an untapped growth opportunity in our Target Addressable Market, where broadband
penetration and high-speed connections are significantly lower than the national average level (penetration levels
between 56% and 60%). Given the physical geography and low population density of many Italian rural and
suburban communities, FWA can be the best technological alternative to deliver high broadband speeds at
competitive prices given its limited roll-out costs and fast network deployment times in these areas. Legacy
technologies (i.e., ADSL and FTTC) are proving less effective to meet the growing demand for bandwidth, while
FTTH is either not going to be deployed or will be deployed only with delays in these areas, in part due to the
significant investments required. As the largest provider of broadband and ultra-broadband services in our Target
Addressable Market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to exploit this growth opportunity.

The expansion of our FWA network and service offering in recent years has driven the growth of our total
revenues and other income and Adjusted EBITDA. From the year ended March 31, 2019 our total revenues and
other income and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million, respectively, to
€198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a CAGR of 23.0%), respectively, for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021. For the same period, our loss for the year/period increased from €0.5 million to
€14.9 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 94% of our total revenues and other income was
generated from subscription-based revenues from monthly recurring debits by customers and approximately 6%
was generated from one-off payments, including activation fees and penalties for churned customers.

We divide our offering into the following three segments:

‰ **Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 490,700 B2C**
subscribers (“B2C Subscribers”). Our offering to B2C Subscribers includes modular
commercial offerings designed to address different users’ needs with dedicated add-on
packages: “Entertainment” (streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and remote
working applications) and “Security” (antivirus and parental control).

‰ **Business-to-Business (“B2B”). As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 75,900 B2B**
subscribers (“B2B Subscribers”). Our offering to B2B Subscribers includes connectivity
services for small and home offices (“SoHo”) and small and medium enterprises (“Business”)
to which we offer shared solutions, and for large companies (“TOP”) to which we offer
services through high-end connectivity and dedicated infrastructure.

‰ **FTTH. Although it does not represent our core business, we provide a FTTH service mainly in**
certain urban areas covered by Open Fiber’s FTTH infrastructure to complement our FWA
services in order to meet customer demand. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,400
fiber subscribers (“Fiber Subscribers”).

133


-----

As of June 30, 2021, our B2C and B2B Subscribers included approximately 48,500 wholesale end-customers
(“Wholesale Subscribers”). We sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through internet service providers (“ISP”),
system integrators and to national internet providers and international telecommunications providers to whom we
offer our excess capacity. We plan to strengthen our wholesale offering in the future relying more on major
national and international providers such as TIM and Wind 3 and further expand our wholesale offering to retail
customers.

The below charts set forth the percentage of our total revenues and other income and number of subscribers
represented by each of our three offering segments for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

**Number of Subscribers** **Revenues**

Other income: includes, inter alia, grants from Infratel, out of period income, tax credit and hardware resale.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that a number of key factors gives us a competitive advantage, including:

**_We are the largest provider of FWA services by revenue in Italy with growing market share and innovative_**
**_FWA technology._**

We are the largest provider of BB and UBB FWA services in Italy based on revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In terms of number of subscribers, we have a market share of 34.7% in Italy and we are the
undisputed leader with a market share of 51.5% in our Target Addressable Market. Our market share in the
broadband and FWA markets have grown faster in terms of new subscribers additions than the FWA market and
broadband market generally: our new subscriber additions grew at a CAGR of 24.9% from March 31, 2018 to
March 31, 2021, while the FWA market grew at a CAGR of 13.5% and the broadband market generally grew at a
CAGR of 3.0% during the same period.

The below charts set forth our market shares in Italy and in our Target Addressable Market for the years ended
March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2021 in the broadband and in the FWA markets.

We are the only player in Italy with a focus on FWA services in our Target Addressable Market. The other
principal player in Italy with a focus on FWA technology is Linkem. While Linkem has a larger number of
subscribers than EOLO, it is focused on prepaid solutions for urban and suburban areas and uses the 3.5 GHz
spectrum, which allows for less bandwidth (and therefore lower quality of service). Linkem’s growth in
subscribers was lower than EOLO’s (approximately 11% CAGR (December 2017-2020) compared to EOLO’s
24% (March 2018-2021). Other players in the FWA market include operators such as TIM and Vodafone, which

134


-----

have “FWA-like” service offers based on their mobile infrastructure. While these “FWA-like” services will be
used in selected situations, these services are considered sub-optimal in comparison with FWA since they are
unable to match the data allowance offered by FWA and their implementation can present technical difficulties.

In the wholesale sector, we are the main player offering access to an FWA network in our Target Addressable
Market, which we believe will enable us to capture additional subscribers and therefore continue to grow our
subscriber base and market share in the medium term. As part of its plans to guarantee broadband deployment in
low population density areas with high investment costs, in accordance with the provisions of the EU broadband
State Aid guidelines implemented by the Italian government, Open Fiber is required to provide FWA active
services in White II Areas to third-party operators if no comparable access product is already offered in the same
geographic area by another operator. As EOLO already provides active services in such areas, Open Fiber will
not be required to offer active services in such areas. Even though Open Fiber might still decide to establish an
FWA infrastructure in our Target Addressable Market, we believe that our 80% coverage in our Target
Addressable Market will act as an economic disincentive for Open Fiber. This provides us with a pre-emptive
opportunity in White II areas, thus underpinning the uniqueness of our FWA infrastructure and the leadership
position in our Target Addressable Market.

Our leading market position in our Target Addressable Market is underpinned by the superior performance of our
FWA service offering in such areas as compared to other available fixed BB and UBB technologies. In our
Target Addressable Market, FTTH technology is either largely unavailable or expected to be deployed with
delays while other available technologies, such as ADSL and FTTC, do not offer the same speed and overall
performance levels. Our unique FWA network enables us to currently offer the highest available speed in our
Target Addressable Market with download/upload speeds of up to 100/20 Mbps and up to 1Gbps for selected
business clients and we have an established roadmap to roll out services with a download speed of up to 300
Mbps in the near future. In addition, our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class intervention
services, low time to market and effective maintenance and repair services.

Our leading market position is further supported by our technological knowhow, which has enabled us to develop
unique, proprietary and data-driven technologies to support our functions. These custom solutions include:

‰ EOLIA is our self-designed software for network design, operations, management and
monitoring, which plays a critical role for our network planning and installation approach and
which has contributed to our successful network expansion and customer satisfaction. We use
EOLIA to identify the overall network topology, health status for wireless access and wireless
backhaul network, wireless backhauling link occupation and historical data and trends;

‰ G-EOLO is our location intelligence system which uses internal information and external
sources to identify potentially attractive market areas for our network expansion;

‰ Blue system is our patented traffic re-balancing platform. As part of our Blue system, we have
also developed Otelma, our in-house built software, which continuously applies traffic steering
policy avoiding backhauling congestion; and

‰ Datawave is our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and
warehouse management. The main functions covered by Datawave relate to the automated
processes of the operational activities carried out by our installers. For example, Datawave help
us assign the work orders to our installers and exchanges information with EOLIA about the
field activities aimed at the installation of new BTSs.

Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’
architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result
of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. On-field feedback is key
to improve our performances. For example, we have managers focusing on specific areas of the Italian territory
(i.e., North West, North East, Center and South of Italy). Our area managers, inter alia, update our internal
database in case of poor coverage in certain areas and/or competitors’ presence. We also work with two primary
radio access equipment manufacturers in the design and development of point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) and PTP
connections: Cambium Networks Ltd. and Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions. Over the last few years, we have
leveraged our strong relationships with our suppliers to develop multiple access technologies to achieve optimal
coverage and network performance.

We believe that our superior service offering and technological leadership provide us with a clear competitive
advantage resulting in high customer satisfaction rates (more than 85% for the month ended April 31, 2021,

135


-----

based on the number of customers declaring themselves “very satisfied” after interactions with our technicians)
and in our leading and growing market share. We also believe our leading market position places us well to meet
the growing demand for high-speed connectivity services in our Target Addressable Market.

**_Fast-growing Italian broadband market with a large untapped opportunity for FWA service providers in our_**
**_Target Addressable Market._**

We operate in the underpenetrated Italian fixed broadband market where we see considerable room for growth,
particularly in our Target Addressable Market. Due to the lack of cable infrastructure, delays in fiber roll-out and
difficult morphology, only approximately 67% of Italian households have a broadband connection versus a
European average penetration of approximately 87% as of December 31, 2019.

Broadband connection services are expected to grow and close this gap on the back of growing data consumption
as evidenced by the 25.6% average annual growth rate of fixed line data consumption from the year ended
December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2020 and the 35.7% average annual growth in mobile data
traffic from 2017 to 2020 due to changes in consumer behavior and the availability of increased speeds. The main
drivers of data traffic growth include trends such as the growing use of streaming platforms, online shopping,
online banking applications, video-on-demand as well as gaming and video activities. The growing adoption of
these new applications was boosted by social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns
and the ensuing changes in work and life habits (e.g., remote working, home schooling, and greater adoption of
virtual social interactions). On the back of these long-term trends, data consumption in Italy is expected to
continue growing for the period from 2021 to 2024, driven primarily by fixed connectivity usage.

The graphic below shows the monthly data traffic in Italy for the period 2017-2020 and the forecast for the
period 2021-2024.

(1) broadband access at fixed location, for one household. Technologies include fixed line and wireless (FWA).

In our Target Addressable Market, we see a large untapped opportunity for our services. The penetration of
broadband services in these areas is lower than at national level with penetration levels between 56% and 60% as
compared to a national average of 67% as of December 31, 2019. The low internet penetration is primarily due to
the fact that these areas are serviced mainly through legacy ADSL and FTTC connections which have proven to
be ineffective in delivering high-speed connections in areas with challenging geography and low population
density. For example, ADSL connections offer maximum speeds of up to 30 Mbps. FTTC connections, on the
other hand, offer speeds of up to 100 Mbps, but only if the customer premise is close to the fiber cabinet. FTTC
connection speeds reduce to 30 Mbps for distances from the cabinet of up to 1 kilometer. This distance tends to
increase as the service area becomes more rural (i.e., less home density). There is also a wide variation in the
distribution of the secondary copper length in suburban and rural areas, which leads to inconsistent performance.

We also believe that the plans by fiber providers such as Open Fiber and FiberCop to increase fiber coverage
throughout Italy will have only a limited impact on our competitive position in our Target Addressable Market.
While FTTH technology can deliver connection speeds of up to 1 Gbps, it is a suboptimal technology for rural
and suburban areas for several reasons. First, FTTH has high installation and deployment costs, making it a
viable technology primarily in densely populated areas. For instance, the average FTTH development capital
expenditures per household connected in rural areas is estimated to be more than double the capital expenditures
required for FWA, resulting in significantly longer payback periods.

(1) total deployment capital expenditures (excluding grants).

(2) refers to CPE capital expenditures (excluding cost of router).

In addition, FTTH has experienced long installation periods in rural areas, making it a less appealing technology
as compared to FWA. In the few White I areas already covered with FTTH by Open Fiber, there is a significant
time gap between completion of the network and availability for use by broadband operators due to lack of last
meter-connection to customers’ premises. This factor increases the costs for broadband operators and creates a
time delay in the marketability of areas already covered by a fiber network. This in turn results in inability to
connect consumers’ premises that will present an opportunity in the short-term to medium-term that can be
exploited by FWA operators. Finally, Open Fiber’s FTTH roll-out plans have experienced several delays as
compared to their original schedule, with only 22.6% of targeted municipalities in White I Areas tested as of
August 2021.

As a result, FTTH is not expected to be deployed to the Grey II and White II areas of our Target Addressable
Market, which represent 6.9 million households (or 29% of total Italian households) or will be deployed on a
delayed basis compared to Open Fiber’s original plans for White I areas, representing an additional 4.0 million
households (15% of total). Accordingly, FWA can be seen as the best technological alternative to FTTH in our
Target Addressable Market on account of FWA’s generally competitive broadband speeds, lower roll-out cost
and more rapid speed of network deployment as compared to FTTH.

In addition, we believe that 5G mobile technology does not represent a viable alternative to FWA service in our
Target Addressable Market. First, 5G mobile technology is designed to offer connectivity in a mobile context,
rather than to be a fixed broadband service. In addition, the substantial upfront investment needed to deploy 5G
infrastructure in low-density rural and suburban areas in Italy (such as our Target Addressable Market), including
the cost of towers and other assets, are unlikely to generate an attractive return on investment for 5G operators.
Mobile operators offering “FWA-like” solutions are also not expected to present a meaningful competitive threat
to EOLO, as their solutions are based on mobile technology which may face congestion issues (as the same
spectrum is used for mobile and fixed users, which typically leads to data caps). In contrast, EOLO utilizes a
different network architecture with fixed line-of-sight from the antennas to the houses, ensuring a fixed
bandwidth for each household.

These considerations explain why the number of FWA connections in Italy has doubled over the last five years
from 0.74 million in 2015 to 1.37 million in September 2020 to 1.54 million in December 2020, resulting in an
increase in FWA’s penetration of the Italian broadband market from 5% to 9% of all broadband technologies.
Due to its geographical characteristics and large number of small municipalities (i.e., municipalities with less

137

|(>5|0%)|
|---|---|

than 5,000 inhabitants), Italy is by far the European country with the highest number of FWA connections and
the highest FWA proportion of fixed BB lines.

The graphic below shows the amount (measured in thousands of households) of FWA connections (‘000
households) in Europe between 2016 and 2019.

We believe there is a large, untapped opportunity for our services in our Target Addressable Market due to
FWA’s ability to effectively meet the growing data consumption demand in our Total Addressable Market and
the expectation that fiber coverage will not reach areas in our Target Addressable Market representing 29% of
Italian households or will reach areas representing 15% of Italian households only with delay. We believe that
FWA will continue to gain market share in our Total Addressable Market and in what we view as our core target
addressable market of approximately 7.5 million households in Grey II and White II areas (our “Core Target
**Addressable Market”) and triple the number of connections between 2021 and 2036.**

**_Unique proprietary infrastructure network that provides high barriers to entry._**

We own, lease and operate a unique proprietary end-to-end infrastructure network that enables us to offer a highquality service to our customers. We are the only end-to-end FWA infrastructure network covering more than 80%
of households in our Target Addressable Market and we expect that our coverage will increase following the
anticipated completion of the FWA network in the near future. Our FWA infrastructure covers the complete
end-to-end core, distribution and access networks of the fixed data transmission chain. Our core network leverages

138


-----

four core national POP, five core regional POP and two data centers (main center and disaster recovery center).
Three of our core national POP are deployed in the Milan area, and the fourth in the Rome area, and they are
connected with over-the-top (“OTT”) providers and internet. We have regional POP collecting local traffic in
high-penetration areas in Bologna, Verona, Turin and Pisa (and the POP in Naples will be deployed in early
2022).Our POP and data centers are connected through our backbone, which is secured by long-term IRU on third
parties dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800 kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more than
approximately +416% since March 31, 2018). Our long-term IRU have average residual durations of 15-18 years
as of May 2021. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and radio links. As of March 31, 2021, our
fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open
Fiber to secure 1,000 FTTA links. As of March 31, 2021, we have approximately 3,600 radio links connecting
BTS (an increase of approximately +41% compared to March 31, 2018). Our access network connects our
customers to the network through a system of owned BTS (approximately 3,400) which are installed on thirdparty transmission towers, and CPEs, which are installed on customers’ premises but owned by us.

Our BTS and CPEs communicate using the following spectrum: the licensed 28 GHz spectrum (through our
EOLO Wave G technology, which is able to offer internet speed up to 100 Mbps with PMP wireless connection
and up to 1 Gbps for selected business customers with a PTP wireless connection), the unlicensed 5 GHz
spectrum (though our EOLO Wave technology, which is able to offer internet speed up to 30 Mbps) and, only in
the region of Val d’Aosta, the licensed 3.5 GHz spectrum (using our EOLO Wave technology). As of June 30,
2021, we have in Italy (i) the largest spectrum ownership of 28 GHz spectrum alongside TIM and (ii) the second
largest spectrum ownership across millimeter wavers and second only to TIM, leveraging the 26 GHz spectrum
and the 28 GHz spectrum.

Our infrastructure mainly leverages third party towers through rental agreements. We rent more than 3,000
towers (where our BTS are installed) approximately 50% of which are from independent owners and local
entities, which we believe enables us to obtain generally favorable leasing terms. The vast majority of our towerrental agreements are long-term with a residual life of 14 years and provide for a tacit renewal. The remaining
towers are either secured under IRU contracts or owned and built on land where we own surface rights.

Our infrastructure network comprises modern and state-of-the art equipment. Over the last three years to
March 31, 2021, we invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. During this period, our network coverage has expanded from
5,900 municipalities in 2018 to 6,300 municipalities in 2021, from 66% to approximately 80% of households in
our Target Addressable Market and from 0.5% in 2018 to 34.6% in 2021 of our Target Addressable Market in the
South of Italy and Italian islands. The number of BTS reached approximately 3,400 on August 31, 2021 (an
increase of approximately +45% compared to March 31, 2018). Between 2019 and 2021, we increased the
internet access capacity of our network from 720 Gbps to 2,250 Gbps, with the large part of this increase
achieved during 2020 in order to cope with the increase in data traffic and internet usage during the COVID 19
pandemic. As a result, our network today has sufficient capacity to support our expectations of an exponential
growth in data consumption.

The graphics below show our FWA network coverage by region as percentage of households and number of
active BTS covered as of June 30, 2021.

We believe our largely proprietary infrastructure network is unique and provides us with a number of competitive
advantages. It is the only FWA infrastructure network in Italy already deployed and that guarantees an 80%
coverage of our Target Addressable Market, which provides us with a clear “first mover advantage”. Our
network is an end-to-end network built on largely proprietary infrastructure or operated under long-term
contracts. Our backbone and distribution networks are secured through long-term quasi ownership contracts with
leading providers. The network is resilient, has ample spare capacity and ensures best in class performance even
at traffic peaks. We have a diverse high-frequency spectrum ownership, representing the second largest spectrum
ownership of the26 GHz spectrum and the 28 GHz spectrum in Italy. Finally, our network enables us to offer
market leading speeds of 100 Mbps and, for selected business customers, up to 1 Gbps.

Our infrastructure network represents a significant barrier to entry in our Target Addressable Market given the
large investments required to build the network and the economic disadvantages that would result from an
overbuild in the same areas, such as such as the risk of lower penetration and inability to reach the optimal
saturation levels for each installed BTS. By offering our excess capacity in our Target Addressable Market to
other telecommunications operators under wholesale arrangements, we retain our infrastructure leadership while
discouraging competitors from deploying their own FWA network; instead the operators rely on our
state-of-the-art infrastructure. In addition, the provision of a 28 GHz offering requires significant technical
capabilities and capital investments as well as spectrum licenses that are not easily obtainable for operators
lacking familiarity with the spectrum license tender process. We believe our business is protected also by our
capillary local presence, technological know-how and proprietary network planning software and capabilities.

**_Superior utility-like offering resulting in high customer satisfaction, low churn rates and high proportion of_**
**_subscription-based revenues._**

We have a superior utility-like service offering that is underpinned by a high proportion of subscription-based
revenues from recurring monthly debits by customers, market leading low churn rates and high customer
satisfaction levels.

Our revenues generated by monthly subscription contracts represented 94%, 94% and 93% of our total revenues
and other income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the year ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended
March 31 2020, respectively.

Our B2C offering includes a monthly subscription-based solution (i.e., EOLO più) and a prepaid solution (i.e.,
_EOLO Quando Vuoi). Our monthly subscription-based solution, currently at €24.90 per month, includes_
unlimited voice, and can be bundled with three additional packages that enable better connections or quality of
service based on customer needs (“Entertainment” (streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and
remote working applications) and “Security” (antivirus and parental control)), which increases the monthly price
to up to €36.90. Approximately 76% of our B2C Subscribers using our monthly subscription solution chooses at
least one additional service as of March 31, 2021. Our revenues generated through sales to B2C Subscribers are
mostly entirely derived from subscription based solutions (99%, 99% and 100% in the years ended March 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Only 1% of our revenues generated by sales to B2C Subscribers derive from
sales to pre-paid customers that typically use our services on a seasonal basis (such as during vacation periods),
which further illustrates the stable nature of our customer base and revenues.

Our high-quality service is reflected by market leading low churn rates and stable Blended ARPU over time. For
the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our Blended Churn Rate was 11.8%, 10.8% and 12.5%,
respectively. These levels compare with average churn rates for the Italian broadband market over such periods
of 26.3%, 22.7% and 24.2% respectively. Our average Blended Churn Rate 2019-2021 of 11.7% is in line with
the churn rate for FTTH (10% average for the years 2016 to 2019) and considerably lower than churn rates for
other fixed broadband technologies, such as FTTC (22% average for the years 2016 to 2019) and ADSL (40%
average for the years 2016 to 2019). In the year ended March 31, 2021, we experienced a slight increase in churn
rates due to the COVID-19 lock downs, which led to higher network saturation and increases of technical issues.
In general, however, the low levels of our Blended Churn Rates reflect the loyalty of our customer base and its
high satisfaction levels.

Our Blended ARPU has been stable over the past three years, amounting to €29.9, €29.8, €29.5 and €29.4 per
month in the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021,
respectively.

In addition, our customer service is supported by our capillary-like presence in our Target Addressable Market
through our FWA network itself, which due to our network of professionals and system integrators located in the
different regions, has resulted in a strong territorial presence that has allowed us take advantage of the deep
territorial knowledge gained through the years, in morphological (i.e., geographic features, building and
population density) and technical terms. This is supported by a wide network of 1,500 installers who have a
broad and deep knowledge of their local market characteristics, customer base and competitor behavior. This
capillary-like presence has been developed over the years through our experience and research and development
investments. We use our proprietary software, including G-EOLO (our location intelligence system) and
Datawave (our management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and warehouse
management) to support our local presence. Our capillary local presence enables us to offer best-in-class
intervention services and low time to market reflected by our average time to market of 10-14 days (from order
to activation). In addition, our trained installer base offers an effective maintenance and repair service and
enables us to effectively capture cross-selling opportunities. We believe that this bespoke approach distinguishes
our offer from that of the large FTTH/FTTC groups and other Italian FWA operators that do not have this deep
presence in, or our demonstrated commitment to, our Target Addressable Market.

Our high Net Promoter Score at national level (“NPS”) (as of November 2020) reflects our high customer
satisfaction, ranking EOLO as the second best-in-class after the national FTTH leader Fastweb.

**_Strong financial performance with high profit margins and large proportion of success-based capital_**
**_expenditures resulting in attractive cash flow dynamics._**

We have a demonstrated a strong financial performance with a high growth in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
In addition, our high profit margins, high proportion of success-based growth capital expenditures and
structurally negative working capital provide us with attractive cash flow dynamics and a high degree of control
over our cash flow generation.

As compared to the year ended March 31, 2019, our total revenues and other income, and Adjusted EBITDA
increased from €129.8 million, and €67.7 million to €198.3 million (a CAGR of 20.7%) and €107.9 million (a
CAGR of 23.0%) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Over the same period, our loss for the year/period
increased from €0.5 million to €14.9 million. The increase in total revenues and other income and Adjusted
EBITDA was driven by a significant growth in our subscriber base at a CAGR of 19.6% from March 31, 2019 to
June 30, 2021 and a stable Blended ARPU. Over this period, our Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from
52.2% to 54.4% driven by our strong revenue growth and economies of scale deriving from our network
scalability. We expect our Adjusted EBITDA margin to improve as we continue to grow our network coverage
and customer base. We should also benefit from decreasing subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”) (as a proportion
of revenues) as our growth rates normalize. Additionally, we expect that by selling excess capacity to other
operators and growing our Wholesale business, we can increase the utilization of our asset base and benefit from
operating synergies.

We achieved strong financial performance during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the growth of our B2C and
B2B customer base resulting in an overall 19.6% growth in our subscribers between March 31, 2020 and
March 31, 2021, and benefited from the increased, accelerated investments that we made at the start of the
pandemic in order to adapt our network capacity to a growing demand for broadband capacity and services,
particularly in fiber backhauling and the rollout of our 28 GHz service.

We have invested approximately €300 million in Adjusted Capital Expenditures and €239.0 million in
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment during the three year period. Our Adjusted Capital Expenditures
have grown at a CAGR of 17.9% from 2019 to 2021 to sustain an increased geographic coverage, a larger
customer base and an increase of our network capacity to support the growing data traffic during the pandemic.
We have made significant investments to support growth, mainly for CPE, including the higher cost 28 GHz
CPEs, and BTS/backhauling infrastructure. Investments in CPEs (including installation) and BTS represent the
large majority of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures, equal to 83.7%, 83.0% and 79.7% of the total for the years
ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
approximately 63.0%, 64.3% and 62.4%, respectively of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures are growth-related
with the balance related to investments aimed at preserving our current customer base (e.g., maintenance,
network upgrading and subscriber base upselling toward 28GHz spectrum). Of our Growth Adjusted Capital
Expenditures, the majority relates to CPE and are therefore success-based. CPEs is installed only after the
execution of a new contract with the client and if the client decides to terminate the contract, we charge a penalty
to retrieve CPEs from a customer’s premises. The remaining Growth Adjusted Capital Expenditures relate to
increases in data capacity and BTS investments, which are determined by our data driven technologically
advanced network development applications, which have proven successful so far in identifying new areas of
profitable growth. For these reasons, we believe that a large proportion of our Growth Adjusted Capital
Expenditures are low risk, success based and closely related to the growth in our customer base.

We also believe we can exert a good degree of control over our cashflow generation capability. Expenditures
related to the purchase of CPEs and BTS represent the largest portion of our Adjusted Capital Expenditures. We
enter into arrangements with suppliers that include purchase commitments of up to one year; however, our
arrangement with Cambium, our current major supplier of CPEs, includes purchase commitments of up to three
months. As a result, we have low proportion of committed capital expenditures. In addition, a significant
component of our costs are marketing and sales costs, which are mainly variable as they relate to new subscriber
acquisition and therefore they increase in absolute value alongside customer base. The short commitment period
of our largest capital expenditure items and the significant proportion of operating costs directly linked to new
customer acquisitions provide us with additional cashflow flexibility in periods of low market growth or periods
of reduced investments in network growth. Our cashflow generation is also supported by a structurally negative
working capital as retail customers are billed in advance on a bi-monthly basis.

Our business has a demonstrated ability to generate robust cashflows pre-growth capital expenditure. Over the
last three years, our Cash Available for Debt Service (pre-growth) amounted to €28.6 million in 2019,
€43.8 million in 2020 and €57.5 million in 2021, resulting in robust Cash Conversion of 42.2% in 2019, 50.0% in

142


-----

2020 and 53.4% in 2021. We have historically reinvested these cashflows in our business to sustain our increased
geographic coverage and network expansion. For the same periods, our net cash flows generated by operating
activities was €56.8 million, €83.3 million and €91.6 million, respectively.

We plan to continue to invest in growth capital expenditures to expand our network coverage and subscriber base
and exploit the substantial growth opportunity presented by our Target Addressable Market, which we expect
will continue to generate a profitable revenue growth deriving from our operating leverage and scalable business
model. We intend to continue to use our internal cashflow generation to finance our growth together with the
additional liquidity raised through the Transactions and to pursue a prudent financial policy carefully monitoring
our financial leverage and maintaining sufficient liquidity sources. We expect that our high profit margins, low
maintenance capital expenditures, high proportion of success-based growth capital expenditures, low committed
capital expenditures and structurally negative working capital will continue to provide us with attractive cashflow
dynamics and a high degree of control over our cashflow generation.

**_Highly committed Sponsor investing in unique infrastructure network and strongly experienced management_**
**_team with clear industry vision._**

We are supported by our highly committed sponsor, Partners Group, and our founder and Chief Executive
Officer and senior executive team. As part of the Acquisition, funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group
and our founder are contributing €910.1 million of new equity (consisting of equity and subordinated shareholder
loan) funds and rollover equity funding (consisting of equity and subordinated shareholder loan) to the Group,
representing approximately 70% of our capitalization as adjusted for the Acquisition. We believe this investment
reflects our shareholders’ commitment to the business.

Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Luca Spada, founded the business in 1999, and has guided us through
our development and growth over the last twenty years with his clear industry vision and emphasis on developing
proprietary solutions to the challenges faced in offering state-of-the-art FWA services to the underserved
suburban and rural areas of Italy, thus closing the digital and speed divide for these areas. Luca Spada will
indirectly re-invest in EOLO through his vehicle Cometa, retaining a 25% ownership and will continue to act as
CEO and a member of our board of directors.

The eight members of our senior executive team have over 170 years of combined telecommunications and
technology experience gained at leading participants in the sector, including Vodafone, Open Fiber, TIM, BT,
Sky, Fastweb, Metroweb and Iliad. Our management has a strong track record of delivering strong organic
growth and successfully completing large capital expenditures investment plans.

Moreover, following the Acquisition, we expect to benefit from the market expertise, business relationships,
knowledge and experience of Partners Group, which is a global private markets investment management firm.
The acquisition of EOLO is financed with dedicated infrastructure capital. In private infrastructure, Partners
Group manages assets of USD 16 billion and has on behalf of its clients directly invested in more than 140
businesses and assets since inception. The investment focus in private infrastructure is on companies and assets
that combine recurring cash flows with value creation opportunities. We expect therefore to benefit from Partners
Group track record and expertise in the infrastructure sector, including in particular the telecommunications
sector.

**Our Strategies**

We intend to grow our business and maintain our market leadership by implementing the following strategies:

**_Continue the technological upgrade of our FWA network to offer higher connection speeds and improved_**
**_quality of service._**

Our technological know-how represents an important driver of our success and a distinct competitive advantage.
Our proprietary data-driven network planning and cost-conscious approach to new installations have historically
yielded successful network expansion, generated high customer satisfaction levels and supported our profitable
growth. We intend to continue the technological upgrade of our infrastructure network to offer high connection
speeds and improved service quality, to upsell our service offering to our existing customer base and to manage
our churn rate. Our network upgrade is based on three key pillars:

‰ _Migration from EOLO Wave to EOLO Wave G. EOLO Wave is the FWA broadband service_
which leverages the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum (or 3.5 GHz in Valle d’Aosta) and offers a
maximum download speed of 30 Mbps. EOLO Wave G is the ultra-broadband FWA service

143


-----

using the 28 GHz licensed spectrum and offers a maximum speed of 100 Mbps and up to 1
Gbps for selected B2B customers (i.e., customers who have a PTP connection). As of June 30,
2021, approximately 76% and 23% of our customers relied on EOLO Wave and EOLO Wave
G, respectively, for their connectivity. In recent years, we have started to increase our 28 GHz
presence and migrate subscribers from 5 GHz to 28 GHz plans. The historical churn rate is
higher on 5 GHz products as compared to 28 GHz products as 28 GHz products have higher
performance. As a result, one of the tools that we have to proactively prevent churn is to offer
upgrades to customers who may be served by BTS that are over-utilized in the 5 GHz
bandwidth. As we increase our 28 GHz presence, we intend to follow our roadmap to attain
download speeds of up to 300 Mbps in the near future and provide this solution to all of our
customers relying on EOLO Wave G for their connectivity.

‰ _Expansion of our fiber backhauling. Our distribution network is based on fiber backhauling and_
radio links. Our fiber backhauling provides direct fiber connections which bring higher
capacity and availability as compared to our radio links. Our fiber backhauling is secured by
leased capacity circuits. As part of our strategy to expand our fiber backhauling and therefore
improve our network reliability and efficiency, in 2021 we signed an agreement with Open
Fiber which secured us access to an additional 1,000 FTTA links.

‰ _Continuous development of our proprietary software and applications. We continue to make_
investments to drive the development of our own digital infrastructure in order to improve
reliability, coverage and speed. Our research and development efforts in recent years have
included, and will continue to include, two main projects: 5G NR (New Radio) and traffic
optimization. 5G NR is a new radio access technology developed for 5G mobile networks. It is
designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks. In recent years, we have
been working with our suppliers to develop a 5G NR standard compatible solution able to
support FWA technology services. In our second main project, since 2014 we have developed
our own BTS router with the goal of optimizing network traffic. We have also developed
Otelma, our in-house designed software, which continuously applies traffic steering policies to
avoid backhauling congestion. Our goal is to leverage our research and development outputs
and roll them out across our network to support the reliability, redundancy and efficiency of the
services we provide.

**_Accelerate network expansion to cover underserved White and Grey Areas in our Target Addressable Market_**
**_to acquire new customers._**

We intend to accelerate the nationwide expansion of our FWA infrastructure network, particularly in the South of
Italy where we have less of a presence. Our FWA network presently covers approximately 80% of households in
our Target Addressable Market and we expect this coverage to increase significantly following expansion of our
fiber backhauling, the deployment of new 28 GHz BTS and the upgrade of existing BTS. We plan to continue to
manage carefully our FWA network expansion and maximize our network efficiency leveraging the following:

‰ _Our network planning tools. We will continue to use our proprietary, data-driven network_
planning and installation tools and applications, such as EOLIA and G-EOLO. Using these
tools, we carry out in-depth analyses using multiple criteria to assess potential new
development areas, including: the coverage request coming from a certain area, the market
potential, socio-demographic characteristics and the competitor presence. This process allows
us to assess a suitability score to each area and to highlight the most profitable areas for our
coverage expansion. After the area has been identified, we conduct the on-site survey to choose
the optimum tower sites and finalize the technical configuration. The process ends with the
devices being activated and configured by EOLIA. By using this process and our proprietary
software application EOLIA, we have been able to optimize our selection process for new
installations and achieve attractive payback periods for our investments in network expansion.

‰ _Deep territorial knowledge. Our installers represent a unique asset and are critical to our_
success. We have been supporting the creation of our community of installers providing
continuous training, assistance, supporting tools and applications and engagement activities.
Installers are selected based on their connections with the territory and their experience and we
believe this will help us acquire customers in underserved areas and build our new customers’
loyalty, as installers represent a trusted point of reference for customers.

144


-----

The large majority of the investments that we have made over the past three years to expand our FWA network
included investments in CPE (including installation) and BTS (equal to 83.7%, 83.0% and 79.7% of our Adjusted
Capital Expenditures for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively). For the years ended
March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, approximately 63.0%, 64.3% and 62.4%, respectively, of our Adjusted Capital
Expenditure are growth-related with the balance related to investments aimed at preserving our current customer
base (e.g., maintenance, network upgrading and subscriber base upselling to 28 GHz spectrum solutions). Of our
Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures, the majority relates to CPE and is therefore success-based. Our
remaining Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures relate to increases in data capacity and BTS investments,
which are driven by our data driven technologically-advanced network development applications, which have
proven successful so far in identifying new areas of profitable growth. For these reasons, we believe that a large
proportion of our Adjusted Growth Capital Expenditures are low risk, success based and closely related to the
growth of our customer base. We intend to continue to be disciplined in our selection process of new areas of
profitable growth.

We believe that we are well-positioned to expand our subscriber base in Grey II and White areas for the reasons
outlined in the table below.

**BB Areas** **EOLO’s strategy**

Grey II - Target an underpenetrated market of 4.6 million households with better technology (FWA)
than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where FTTH coverage is not expected.

          - The Government is concentrated on bridging the digital divide and therefore we expect
that future government tenders will be focused on areas where EOLO is not already
present.

          - The Government may offer public subsidies to private operators in underserved areas
where none are currently present or plan to expand into; this may offer upside potential
related to areas currently not included in EOLO’s network coverage plan that has been
shared with the Government.

White I - Target an underpenetrated market of 4.0 million households currently served with
low-speed broadband and where FWA is the best technological alternative to FTTH.

          - FWA and FTTH can co-exist in White I areas for the long term and jointly address the
digital divide. FTTH is not expected to be rolled out in 100% of White I households due to
high technical KO rates and expensive last mile connection.

          - Open Fiber’s delay in network roll-out opens a window of opportunity for EOLO to
capture subscribers first and then prevent these subscribers from changing to other
operators when EOLO is rolled out by offering speeds that would be sufficient for most
consumers. EOLO will also be able to re-sell Open Fiber’s open-access FTTH to its
customers as a churn mitigation tactic.

White II - Target underpenetrated market of 2.9 million households with better technology (FWA)
than currently available (FTTC and ADSL), and where no FTTH coverage is currently
foreseen.

          - Pre-empt Open Fiber’s FWA network roll-out by rolling out its own network first.
Considering the delay in Open Fiber’s roll-out plan (only 3.6% of FWA network has been
completed as of August 2021), and EOLO’s territorial and technological knowledge, we
believe EOLO has a strong competitive edge. As of February 2021, Open Fiber received
321 FWA orders (81% KO rate compared to 25% KO EOLO’s rate).

**_Continue expansion of our wholesale footprint._**

As the first mover in our Target Addressable Market, we have established a high-quality infrastructure network
which is difficult to replicate in a cost-efficient way. We currently offer and expect to continue to offer our
excess capacity to other national operators that can exploit EOLO’s infrastructure to either sell solutions to new
customers who are located in areas where such operators do not have a network infrastructure or migrate
customers currently served through underperforming technologies in our Target Addressable Market. In addition,
we plan to expand our wholesale channel by selling our solutions to independent and local ISP who are not able
to sustain the network investments required to update their wireless networks with the latest technologies or to
adapt their capacity to the increased traffic.

We intend to aggressively expand our wholesale offering as we see a number of benefits that we can achieve
from doing so. Offering our excess capacity to other operators will reduce our subscriber acquisition costs,
thereby helping to de-risk the commercial strategy of our core B2C and B2B businesses and discourage

competitors from deploying their own FWA network, and instead having competitors rely on our state-of-the-art
infrastructure. The resulting growth in the subscriber base should enable us to improve our network efficiency by
utilizing available capacity with no impact on the connection quality for our customers. In addition, we believe
that expanding our wholesale offering in areas where we are the sole provider of FWA services will help manage
our churn rate as customers switching among operators hosted on our network will nevertheless continue to use
our infrastructure. Additionally, we expect that by selling excess capacity to other operators and growing our
wholesale business, we maximize the utilization of our asset base further benefitting from operating synergies.

Prior to 2021, our wholesale distribution was limited only to B2B customers through the agreement signed with
Wind 3 and other operators. Following the recently announced memorandum of understanding with TIM, we
intend to expand our wholesale distribution to B2C customers. We intend to sell to our Wholesale Subscribers
through other ISPs, system integrators and national (e.g., Retelit, Fastweb and Vianova) and international (e.g.,
Sparkle, NTT, Telefònica, Verizon, BT and AT&T) internet providers. We expect that our wholesale strategy
will be a key driver of our future growth in subscribers and market share.

**_Capitalize on attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities._**

We will continue to evaluate additional organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the FWA market in Italy
and outside Italy over the medium term to long term.

In particular, we may consider options with respect to launching our own mobile offering in order to further
enhance our existing customer proposition by cross-selling mobile services, thus encouraging our customers to
subscribe to both fixed-line and mobile services, which we expect will result in a reduction of customer churn
rate. We intend to apply a strategic cost-benefit analysis to evaluate potential targets and growth opportunities
and only pursue such growth opportunities that are accretive to cash flow generation.

In addition, we may selectively consider opportunities for consolidation in the fragmented FWA market in Italy,
which includes a number small local FWA operators.

In the longer term, we will explore the potential exporting of our FWA business model to other appropriate
European markets that have market characteristics and competitive dynamics that are similar to those of the
Italian market.

**Our History**

In 1999, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Luca Spada founded NGI S.p.A. (“NGI”) a videogame players’
community, which became the principal forum for Italian gamers.

As it continued its development, NGI was acquired by I.NET in 2000, which became part of BT Italia in 2007. In
2007, “EOLO”, a solution providing internet services through a then innovative fixed wireless radio technology
that used television tower bandwidth to cover areas which would otherwise not have broadband internet
connectivity, such as mountain valleys and sparsely populated areas, was first offered to customers. In 2012, BT
Italia sold NGI to our current main shareholder Cometa, a company controlled by our CEO Luca Spada and
minority shareholders. In 2014, we were awarded €20 million in contributions by the MED to extend our network
in five Italian regions (i.e., Liguria, Marche, Emilia Romagna and Abruzzo). In 2016, NGI changed its name to
EOLO and developed EOLO Wave G, our technology using the 28 GHz spectrum. In 2017, Searchlight Capital
Partners L.P. (via SCP EPC UK Limited) acquired 49% of EOLO. In 2018, we launched the first 100 Mbps ultrabroad band FWA network in Italy. In 2019, we obtained financing of approximately €145 million from a pool of
financial institutions to expand our network in the south of Italy.

-----

**Our Offering**

We offer a wide range of fixed-line voice and Internet broadband and ultra-broadband services to both consumer
and business customers, mainly using our proprietary FWA network, which allows fixed wireless internet access
to homes or businesses without laying fiber and cables to provide last mile connectivity. This enables us to
provide ultra-high-speed broadband to sub-urban and rural areas where the topography and population density
result in the cost of laying fiber or maintaining fiber lines being prohibitively expensive. See “Industry.”

In addition, in 2020, we launched a fiber resale service through a supply agreement with Open Fiber which
allowed us to utilize Open Fiber’s infrastructure in all municipalities where Open Fiber is present. We divide our
offering into the following three segments:

**_B2C_**

As of June 30, 2021, we have approximately 490,700 B2C Subscribers. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, revenues generated through sales to B2C Subscribers accounted for approximately 68.50% of our
revenues. From the year ended March 31, 2019 to the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenues
generated through sales to B2C Subscribers increased from €78.8 million to €135.9 million.

Our B2C offering includes modular commercial offerings designed to address different users’ needs with
dedicated add-on packages. Our main B2C solution is EOLO più, a monthly subscription-based solution that can
be bundled with three additional packages that enable better connections or quality of service based on customer
needs: “Entertainment” (streaming and gaming), “Study & Work” (studying and remote working applications)
and “Security” (antivirus and parental control). For a fixed monthly fee (minimum price is €24.90 per month)
EOLO più provides customers with a router, unlimited fixed-line voice services and unlimited internet
connectivity with download speed between 30 and 100 Mbps (using the FWA technology) or up to 1000 Mbps
(using the FTTH technology where available).

We also offer our Customer Subscribers EOLO Quando Vuoi, a prepaid (i.e., the customer pays in advance for a
specified volume of use over a specified period) solution designed for seasonal customers, providing unlimited
internet connectivity with download speed up to 30 Mbps.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 99% of our B2C revenues are generated from
non-seasonal customers acquiring EOLO più and approximately 1% from seasonal customers acquiring EOLO
Quando vuoi.

**_B2B_**

As of June 30, 2021, we have approximately 75,900 B2B Subscribers For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, revenues generated through sales to B2B Subscribers accounted for approximately 25.01% of our total
revenues. From the year ended March 31, 2019 to the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenues
generated through sales to B2B Subscribers increased from €38.4 million to €49.6 million.

147


-----

Our B2B offering includes bespoke solutions to meet the needs of the various B2B Subscribers including,
connectivity services for SoHo and Business customers to whom we offer shared solutions and services for TOP
customers to whom we offer services through high-end connectivity and dedicated infrastructure.

Our main B2B solutions are:

‰ EOLO Impresa: a monthly subscription-based solution designed for Business and TOP
customers requiring up to 20 workstations. For a fixed monthly fee (minimum price is €50.00
per month), EOLO Impresa provides Business or TOP customers with certain services,
including unlimited internet connectivity with download speed between 30 or 100 Mbps.

‰ EOLO TOP: a monthly or annual subscription-based solution designed for Business and TOP
customers, requiring more than 20 workstations. EOLO TOP includes a number of services,
such as unlimited internet connectivity with download speed between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps.

‰ EOLO Professional: a monthly subscription-based solution designed for SoHo customers, who,
for a monthly fee (minimum price is €24.90 per month), receive a router, and unlimited voice
services, dedicated assistance, unlimited internet connectivity with download speed between 30
and 100 Mbps.

In addition, we offer our B2B Subscribers our pre-paid solution EOLO Quando Vuoi (EOLO When You Want
It). See “—B2C.”

_Wholesale Channel_

As of June 30, 2021, our B2C and B2B Subscribers include approximately 48,500 Wholesale Subscribers.

We sell to our Wholesale Subscribers through internet service providers (“ISP”), system integrators and national
(e.g., Wind, Retelit, Fastweb, Vianova) and international (e.g., Sparkle, NTT, Telefònica, Verizon, BT, AT&T)
internet providers.

Historically our wholesale distribution was only to B2B. However, we plan to strengthen our wholesale offering
in the future relying more on big national and international providers and therefore expand our wholesale
offering to retail customers. We intend to carry out a B2C acquisition strategy focused on (i) expanding
wholesale partnerships with large operators to migrate customers currently served through non-performing
technologies, and (ii) small ISPs not able to sustain investments required to keep their own wireless networks
updated with latest technologies or to adapt their capacity to increased traffic. In furtherance of the strategy to
partner with large operators, in 2020 we have signed an agreement with Wind 3 and announced a memorandum
of understanding with TIM, to launch strategic partnerships project in Italy’s “white areas’ (i.e., rural areas) in
which TIM and Wind 3 will be able to provide internet access services to their customers using our proprietary
infrastructure network.

**_FTTH_**

As of June 30, 2021, we have approximately 1,400 Fiber Subscribers. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, revenues generated through sales to Fiber Subscribers accounted for less than 0.18% of our revenues.

We provide a fiber service as alternative solution to complement our FWA offering, ensuring fulfilment of our
customers’ requests where a specific FWA connection cannot be delivered and where a FTTH connection is
available. In 2020, our FTTH offering was released in the Black Areas (e.g., medium-sized cities) and we plan to
release it in these areas of our Target Market and where a FTTH connection is available in the near future. We
offer to Fiber Subscribers our EOLO Più solution based on the FTTH technology. Our FTTH offering is
supported by contractual arrangements we have entered into with Open Fiber to utilize their FTTH infrastructure.

**Research and Development (“R&D”)**

Our R&D activities are carried out at our headquarter in Busto Arsizio by a dedicated team of engineers,
researchers and technicians. Among the technologies assessed and approved by our R&D team are certain
extremely important technologies to support our functions, including our proprietary software EOLIA, G-Wave,
Blue and Data Wave.

148


-----

We have incurred and continue to incur significant investments to drive the development of Italy’s digital
infrastructure, increasing reliability, coverage and speed. Our R&D activities focus on two areas:

‰ Preliminary analysis, study, design and development of new technical solutions, including our
geo-intelligence system, automation of marketing and customer journey processes and
enhancement of big data system integrations; and

‰ Research of innovative solutions in the network area: core network evolution to support
growing network traffic, design and functional development activities for the realization of a
network infrastructure based on 26/28 GHz frequency and enhancement of the network design
by using “small cell” technology and new coverage maps.

Our R&D efforts in recent years have included two projects:

‰ _5G NR (New Radio). 5G NR is a new radio access technology developed for the 5G (fifth_
generation) mobile network. It is designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G
networks. In recent years, we have been working with our suppliers to develop a 5G NR
standard compatible solution able to support FWA services. The diffusion and evolution of 5G
based solutions has also the potential to produce—according to the amount of usable spectrum
portions—an easy and effective performance improvement in our FWA services.

‰ _Traffic optimization. Since 2014, we have engaged in research and development efforts_
regarding our own BTS router with the goal of optimizing network traffic. We have also
developed Otelma, our in-house built software, which continuously applies traffic steering
policy avoiding backhauling congestion.

Our R&D initiatives had a key role in supporting the development of our network planning tools. See
“—Network and Infrastructure—Network Planning.”

**_Offices_**

Our corporate headquarters are located in Busto Arsizio (VA), which we lease from third parties. In addition, we
have service agreements with third parties, which grant us the right to use offices in Rome and in Padua.

**_Network_**

We have secured our approximately 14,800 kilometers of dark fiber under long term contracts (duration between
15 and 18 years) with main wholesale operators and public infrastructure providers (e.g., Fastweb and TIM)
providing us with an indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”). In addition, for our radio backhauling we use leased
capacity fiber circuits. We lease capacity from other providers, including TIM and Fastweb. In 2021 we signed
an IRU contract with Open Fiber providing us with additional 1,000 FTTA links to BTS.

Our infrastructure mainly leverages third party towers through rental agreements. We rent space on 3,000 towers
(where our BTS are installed) mainly from independent owners, such as Inwit or EI Towers, with whom we have
rental agreements through 2035, and local entities. The vast majority of our tower-rental agreements are long
term and provide for a tacit renewal. The remaining towers are owned and built on land where we own surface
rights.

**Network and Infrastructure**

Our unique network reaches more than 6,700 municipalities as of June 30, 2021, and covers more than 80% of
the households in all Italian regions. We provide our services through our core, distribution and access networks,
which are fully integrated between themselves to deliver an end-to-end experience to our customers.

**_Core Network_**

A core network provides nationwide IP routing functionalities within certain physical locations called points of
presence (“POPs”). We have four core national POPs (three in Milan and one in Rome) and four core regional
POPs across Bologna, Verona, Turin and Pisa. One additional core regional POPs is in the deployment stage.
Finally, we make use of two data centers, a main center in Siziano (Pavia) and a disaster recovery center in
Brunello (Varese) connected through our backbone. Our backbone is secured by long term IRU contracts on third
parties’ dark fiber infrastructure of approximately 14,800 kilometers as of June 30, 2021 (an increase of more
than approximately +416% since March 31, 2018).

Our national POPs, regional POPs and data centers are connected via dark fiber links. Dark fiber also connects
the regional POPs to the main towers. See “—Distribution Network.”

**_Distribution Network_**

Our distribution network consists of circuits of towers, where our BTS are installed. The BTS act as a radio link
between the distribution network and the customer premise. BTS are generally shared between multiple users but
occasionally can be fully dedicated to a single client in case of specific capacity requirements (e.g., large
business customers). Transmission towers are connected via radio or fiber backhauls:

‰ _Radio Backhauling. Our radio backhauling provides point-to-point (“PTP”) radio links. It_
represents a fast and cost-effective solution, requiring the sole installation of microwave
equipment (i.e., transceiver and parabolic antenna) on the two BTS to be interconnected (under
the condition that the parabolic antennas are in line of sight). As of March 31, 2021, we have
approximately 3,600 radio links connecting BTS (an increase of approximately 41% compared
to 2018).

‰ _Fiber Backhauling. Our fiber backhauling provides direct fiber connections which brings_
higher capacity and availability compared to our radio links. Direct fiber connections are
typically realized on BTS representing a central hub or a root within the network topology, or
to close a network ring (eliminating single point of failure in the backhauling network). Our
fiber backhauling is secured by leased capacity circuits. In addition, in 2021 we signed an
agreement with Open Fiber to secure 1,000 FTTA links to BTS. See “—Our Facilities.”

We use the 26 GHz (24.5-26.5 GHz) and 6-11-18-80 GHz frequencies for our distribution network.

**_Access Network_**

Our access network or “last mile” is the part of a telecommunications network which connects the BTS to the
subscribers, using the CPE. The CPEs are installed on customers’ premises and act as radio terminal antenna,
communicating with the BTS to provide internet service.

Our radio access is mainly based on technologies tailored to specific requirements to best fit our vendors’
architecture to our service models. Such customizations are co-engineered by us and our local partners as a result
of years of continuous refinements based on field experience and territorial knowledge. Our main providers of
radio access equipment are the American company, Cambium Networks Ltd (“Cambium”) and the Greek
company, Intracom S.A. Telecom Solutions (“Intracom”). This equipment can provide either PTP (generally for

150


-----

TOP Subscribers) or point-to-multipoint (“PMP”) connections. Our main access technologies which connect the
BTS to the rooftop CPEs are:

‰ _EOLO Wave. EOLO Wave is the FWA broadband service which leverages the 5GHz_
unlicensed spectrum (or 3.5 GHz in Valle d’Aosta). We have leveraged outdoor multi-user,
multiple input, multiple output technology on our 5GHz network since 2015, allowing capacity
increase under the same amount of spectrum and a better beam directionality, which renders
the radio link more efficient. EOLO Wave provides a maximum speed of 30Mbps and a
coverage range of approximately €20 kilometers from the BTS. We have built a sophisticated
management system around this technology, allowing the network to achieve a high level of
scalability and therefore to support the service quality overall. CPEs using the 5GHz spectrum
have a cost of €172. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 76% of our customers relied on our
EOLO Wave solution.

_EOLO Wave G. EOLO Wave G is the ultra-broadband FWA service using millimetric waves_
based on the 28 GHz licensed spectrum. We launched EOLO Wave G in 2017 to offer the first
100 Mbps FWA product, basically a worldwide prima. Due to the electromagnetic
characteristics of the millimetric waves, the 28 GHz network design requires for tighter
tolerances compared to networks based on lower frequencies. This has led us to adopt a control
and validation process of 28 GHz implementation by working with dedicated measuring tools
that ascertains the correct tilt and azimuth of the panel. This innovation has led to a higher
quality level of the installations, not only for 28 GHz networks, but also for the rest of our
network based on the 5 GHz frequency. Compared to EOLO Wave which uses the 5 GHz
spectrum (an unlicensed band), EOLO Wave G uses the licensed 28 GHz spectrum,
minimizing the external interferences and allowing us to improve the signal to noise ratio (the
ratio of signal power to the noise power). EOLO Wave G provides a maximum speed of
100Mbps (up to 1 Gbps for selected customers) and a coverage range of approximately €5
kilometers from the BTS. CPEs using the 28GHz spectrum have a cost of €366. As of June 30,
2021, 23% of our customers relied on our EOLO Wave G solution.

The graphics below show our FWA network coverage by region as percentage of household and number of
active BTS covered as of June 30, 2021.

**FWA NETWORK COVERAGE BY REGION AS** **FWA NETWORK COVERAGE BY REGION**
**PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS** **AS NUMBER OF ACTIVE BTS**

**_Network Planning_**

We carry out in-depth analyses using multiple criteria to assess potential new development areas. We start by
analyzing the coverage request coming from a certain area. Then we assess the market potential, sociodemographic characteristics and competitor presence. This process allows us to assess a suitability score to each
area and to highlight the most profitable one for our coverage expansion. After the area has been identified on the
map, we start the on-site survey to choose the best tower and finalize the technical configuration. Permits and
contract information are managed and stored in our software EOLIA and are always synchronized with SAP, our

151


-----

enterprise resource planning software, to allow financial management. The process ends with the devices being
activated and automatically configured by EOLIA which discovers and provisions them.

**Customer operations**

**_Customer Care_**

In order to serve our customer base, we aligned our customer service operation to the best practices of the
telecommunications businesses. Over the last three years, we reorganized the Customer Care team pushing for a
diversification and externalization of the workforce which has led to increased efficiency. As part of the
reorganization, we formed a Customer and Operations team and restructured the HD, Customer Service, Credit
and Delivery Operations teams into a singled organizational structure with common performance measurement
metrics. As of June 30, 2021, we have approximately 40% of the total costs of our customer service attributable
to our external provider in Albania (which means approximately 60% of the workforce is internalized). We are
not planning to eliminate our internal resources, but we are aiming—in the near term—to achieve and maintain a
70-30% split between internal and external workforce. We are focused on improving our customer service to
further increase customer satisfaction and decrease churn by offering our customers, inter alia, internet speed
upgrades or CPEs replacements. We recognize our callers through artificial intelligence, algorithms and routing
calls and have a linear and simple call interactive voice response menu, with customers immediately transferred
to operators. Our Customer and Operations team includes approximately 101 agents, team leaders, operation
managers and outsourced resources as of June 30, 2021. This personnel manage our provisioning, customer
service, technical help desk, customer retention and credit recovery; some of these activities are outsourced. Our
high NPS (as of June 30, 2021) further reflect our high customer satisfaction, ranking EOLO as the second
best-in-class after the national FTTH leader Fastweb. In order to monitor our customer care services, we carry
out customer satisfaction analysis (surveys, tickets, etc.) and service quality analysis. In addition, we check the
numbers of malfunctions and churns through analysis by source (e.g., absence of signal) and type (e.g.,
customers navigating slowly).

**_Delivery Operations and Installers_**

We are involved in each step of the installation delivery. We have dedicated IT tools managing the order
assignment, and provide both technical remote support and “in-field” assistance. We rely on a consolidated and
trusted team of approximately 600 local contractor companies and 1,500 external technicians as of March 31,
2021. Our installers represent a unique asset and are critical to our success. We have been supporting the creation
of our community of installers providing continuous training, assistance, supporting tools and applications and
engagement activities. In addition, we have approximately 30 internal technicians as of June 30, 2021, who
manage all activities taking place at the customer’s premises, both during the installation phase and in the case of
a technical error and guarantee on-demand and real-time technical support to each installer. Our installers also
assist with extra-installation interventions/consultations (access devices connection, Wi-Fi management inside
the building etc.) which provide us with further upselling possibilities. Our installers contribute to increase our
customers’ loyalty, representing a trusted point of reference and opportunity to collect useful data when entering
our customers’ premises. In addition, the majority of our installers (in return of a commission) also promote our
services, which allows us to realize synergies and strengthen our national sale network. As of June 2021,
approximately 88% of activations were achieved within 21 days from the order with a 10-14 days average time to
market (from order to activation).

**Suppliers**

We purchase BTS and CPE customized solutions mainly from two wireless infrastructure providers, the
American company Cambium and the Greek company, Intracom (the “Vendors”):

‰ _Cambium. Cambium is the reference vendor for 5GHz. Under our non-exclusive supply_
agreement with Cambium, Cambium undertakes to make available for purchase and sell to us
the PMP 450i and 450m access points, which are used for our EOLO Wave solution and to
provide potential developments of such products. We signed our first agreement with Cambium
in 2013 and have renewed it since then.

‰ _Intracom. Intracom is the reference vendor for 28Ghz equipment. Under our non-exclusive_
supply agreement with Intracom, Intracom undertakes to make available for purchase and sell
to us the WiBAS G5 macro-BS and WiBAS G5 micro-BS access points, which are used for our
EOLO Wave G solution and to provide certain customization, support and maintenance
services of such products. We signed our first agreement with Cambium in 2017 and have
renewed it since then.

152


-----

Our Vendors have been and will continue to be key for our business and any future development of our network
as our FWA technology is mainly based on customizations of Vendor’s proprietary architecture. We purchase
our routers from third party suppliers, such as AVM GmbH and Digital Broadcast S.A.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We depend on third party telecommunications
_providers and other third parties over which we have no direct control for the provision of certain of our_
_telecommunications services.”_

**Employees**

Our employees are located throughout our facilities in Busto Arsizio, Rome and Padua. As of June 30, 2021, we
have 523 employees. There are seven departments, all reporting to our CEO, Luca Spada: Sales and Marketing
(115 employees), Network and Technology (184 employees), Customer and Operations (144 employees), Staff
(80 employees). We do not have a works’ council and, as a consequence, we have not entered into local
collective bargaining agreements.

We outsource our CPE installation and replacement to around 600 contractors and 1,500 technicians, that are
trained by us, distributed across the country. See “Customer Operations—Delivery Operations and Installers.”

**Environmental, Social and Governance**

Over the last few years, we have been actively pursuing an improvement of our environmental, social and
governance (ESG) performance as well as seeking to align our business objectives with Sustainable Development
Goals of the United Nations (the “SDGs”) in particular, SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive
and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), SDG 10 (reduce inequality within and among countries).

We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations. See “Regulation.” These laws and
regulations impose increasingly stringent environmental obligations regarding, among other things, radiation
emissions, zoning, the protection of employee health and safety, noise, and historical and artistic preservation.
We could therefore be exposed to costs and liabilities, including liabilities associated with past activities. Our
operations are subject to obligations to obtain environmental permits, licenses and/or authorizations, or to
provide prior notification to the appropriate authorities.

Our objective is to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and health control laws and all
related permit requirements. We believe that the principal environmental risks arising from our current
operations relate to the potential for electromagnetic pollution and for damage to cultural and environmental
assets. In extreme cases, the penalty for repeat violations of the applicable environmental laws in Italy could
result in administrative sanction, suspension and even revocation of our license.

Our environmental management system is equipped with established standards and processes and is built around
the principles of ISO 45001. We have obtained the necessary certification to operate our network, including
certificates addressing design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of fixed-line
telecommunications networks, occupational health and safety and social accountability.

On April 1, 2021 we changed our bylaws and became a “Benefit Company”, pursuant to the Italian law no. 208
of December 28, 2015. Under Italian law, a Benefit Company is an entity that aims at the distribution of profits,
but, at the same time, pursues one or more common benefit goals in favor of other stakeholders in the business,
including people, communities, territories and the environment, cultural heritage, social activities, entities and
associations, by working in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner.

As a Benefit Company, we pursue some specific goals of common benefit and positive impact on society and the
environment, including:

‰ The promotion of wide access to online and digital services as a fundamental tool of social
inclusion, the promotion of the right to universal internet connection and the education to a
correct and constructive use of such services by any citizen;

‰ The support of economic system prosperity and social welfare in various territories, with
particular attention to geographically disadvantaged areas, more difficult to reach and at risk of
depopulation, through connectivity and access to online services and digital services;

‰ The research and continuous development of synergies with institutions and other territorial
entities of various levels to bridge the digital divide in Italy, contributing with skills and
solutions, with particular attention to emergency situations.

153


-----

The commitment to sustainability is an integral part to our corporate culture and lies at the core of our
relationship with our employees, customers, suppliers and the broader society in which we operate. We strive to
ensure a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees offering them certain benefits (e.g.,
company restaurant, electric car charging stations, indoor and outdoor parking, supplementary health policies,
company cars etc.) and wellbeing initiatives (free internet connection, tax advisory, water and fresh fruit,
company shuttle from/to station, changing rooms with showers for sports activities) in addition to our working
from home policy (two days per week of remote working). Overall, we place great importance on our corporate
social responsibility and our public image and endeavor to apply the highest ethical and legal standards when
shaping our strategic goals and in our daily business activities. We strive to incorporate ethical and social
responsibility principles in our internal guidelines and procedures. In addition, we give our employees extensive
opportunities to develop their skills and talents (e.g., we use competency evaluation programs and potential
assessment system which allow to identify the expectations, potential, strengths and areas for improvement of
our employees) and offer various training courses (e.g., traditional classroom training, e-learning sessions,
experiential training and team building).

**Intellectual Property and Know-How**

We have registered our most important trademarks such as “EOLO” or “EOLO wave” in Italy or in the EU. We
do not own any registered patents or copyrights. We have developed and own proprietary software to design,
roll-out and maintain our FWA network, including:

‰ G-EOLO: location intelligence system which uses internal information and external sources to
identify market areas;

‰ EOLIA: centralized software for design, operations, management and monitoring.
See “—Network Planning;

‰ Blue: patented traffic re-balancing platform; and

‰ Datawave: management tool for development and assurance processes, inventory and
warehouse management.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business, including coverage
for professional liability and transit policy. We have directors’ and officers’ civil liability insurance for members
of our Board of Directors, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the other managers.

We regularly conduct periodic reviews of our insurance coverage to ensure that it is adequate and that our
deductibles and premiums are at reasonable levels. We do not insure against certain operational risks for which
insurance is unavailable or which can only be insured at what we believe to be on unreasonable terms, such as
political risk, war and terrorism. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Uninsured
_losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in our insurance_
_costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or our results of_
_operations.”_

**Licenses and Authorizations**

We hold licenses for the 26 GHz spectrum at national level, the 28 GHz spectrum at national level, the 3.5 GHz
spectrum only for the Valle d’Aosta region and the 6-11-13-18-80 GHz frequencies which are licensed on a
link-by-link basis by the MED. In addition, we also use 5 GHz spectrum on a non-licensed basis. As of June 30,
2021, we have in Italy (i) the largest spectrum ownership of 28 GHz spectrum alongside TIM and (ii) the second
largest spectrum ownership across millimeter wavers and second only to TIM, leveraging the 26 GHz spectrum
and the 28 GHz spectrum.

Our licenses for the 26 spectrum and 28 GHz spectrum were awarded during certain tender procedures issued by
the MED in 2014, 2016 and 2018 for a total consideration of €12.5 million. Such licenses provide us with the
right of use related to 26 GHz and 28 GHz bands in all the Italian regions (included the provinces of Trento and
Bolzano). These licenses will expire on December 31, 2022. We have submitted the application for the extension
of such licenses to the MED. We expect that the procedure will be finalized by the end of 2021 for the 28 GHz
spectrum and by the first quarter of 2022 for 26 GHz spectrum.

Our license for the 3.5 GHz spectrum was awarded by the MED in 2013. This license provides us with the right
to use the band 3.4-3.6 GHz in the Valle d’Aosta region and will expire on May 21, 2023.

154


-----

Our license for the 6-11-13-18-80 GHz spectrum have an automatic annual renewal and will expire together with
the general authorization for the supply of electronic communications network and services in 2034.

We use: (i) the 26 GHz spectrum for both radio backhauling in the transmission network and dedicated PTP
access links to provide up to 1 Gbps to business clients, (ii) the 5 GHz spectrum and 28 GHz spectrum for our
PMP access network, (iii) the 6-11-18-80 GHz frequencies for radio backhauling in the transmission network,
(iv) the 13 GHz for PTP access links and (v) the 3.5 GHz spectrum for our access network in Valle D’Aosta.

In addition, we obtained the following authorizations by the MED for 20 years: a) General Authorization for the
supply of electronic communications network and services, issued on July 28, 2014; b) General Authorization for
Internet Service (ISP), pursuant to an authorization issued on November 11, 2006; c) WISP (IFI Internet Service
Provider), pursuant to an authorization issued on July 15, 2005; and d) VOIP (Voice over IP), pursuant to an
authorization issued on May 29, 2006.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—It may be difficult for us to obtain all licenses,
_permits, rights to use or other authorizations required to operate our existing network or any other required_
_licenses, permits or other authorizations, and once obtained they may be amended, suspended or revoked or may_
_not be renewed.”_

**Distribution Channels**

We use different sales channels to market our products and services with the aim of optimizing customer reach
and reducing costs. We do not conduct out-bound tele-sales and only utilize a network of high quality,
knowledgeable partners for indirect sales.

**_Direct and Indirect Channels_**

We sell our services directly to B2C and B2B Subscribers through our website and in-bound tele-selling, which
is mainly used to support customers who need help to finalize order on our website. We have prioritized the
growth of our online sales channel, which benefits from lower costs than storefront sales and has shown appeal to
younger customers.

We sell indirectly our services to B2C Subscribers through different sub channels: installers (approximately 400
partners which install and sell our solutions), master services (partners who originally used to sell and install
satellite services and then added our solutions in their portfolio), telecommunication shops (approximately 1,000,
present in small villages), master dealers (partners who handle sales to small shops) and approximately 40
corners present inside galleries of larger retail chains. We sell indirectly our services to B2B Subscribers through
approximately 120 partners, who collaborate on a continuative basis with us and are selected among system
integrators and agencies with great experience in the business market.

**_Wholesale Channel_**

We sell our B2B wholesale offering through local partners (e.g., internet service providers, system integrators),
the main national operations (e.g., Wind 3, TIM, Fastweb) and international providers (e.g., TI Sparkle, AT&T,
BT, Verizon). We started our B2C wholesale offering in 2021 and intend to expand this segment relying on large
telco operators. We have signed an agreement with Wind 3 in 2020 and announced a memorandum of
understanding with TIM, to launch strategic partnerships project in Italy’s White areas (i.e., rural areas) in which
TIM and Wind 3 will be able to provide internet access services to their customers using our proprietary
infrastructure network.

**Information Technology and Security**

Information technology is a core, mission-critical asset at EOLO. Our IT systems are centralized with the aim of
optimizing our products and processes, reducing complexity and streamlining technical issues and in order to
adapt faster to an ever-changing market.

Our Technology division has the responsibility to assure the entire lifecycle of our network and IT assets, via the
following five business units:

‰ governance;

‰ IT;

155


-----

‰ network service and engineering;

‰ network development and maintenance;

‰ network and IT operations.

Substantially all of the above business units are tasked with the continuous improvement of our products and
processes, managing significant complexity mainly driven by software and firmware components. As of June 30,
2021, we have 184 employees in our Network and Technology division, which is responsible for the IT and
network engineering, implementation and management activities. We have developed certain proprietary
software. See “—Intellectual Property and Know-How.”

We process personal customers data as part of our business, and therefore we believe that data security and strict
compliance with data protection and privacy laws are competitive factors in our market. We adapted our internal
procedures and operations to the requirements imposed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). We have
appointed certain data processors and a data protection officer, and we have taken and will continue to take
action to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best practices for compliance with the
applicable data protection laws and regulation.

**Legal and Regulatory Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as disclosed below,
we are not engaged in or, so far as we are aware, have pending or threatened, any government, legal or arbitration
proceedings which may have, or have had, a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.

**_Criminal Proceedings against EOLO and certain former and current managers of EOLO._**

EOLO and certain former and current managers of EOLO (including the CEO Luca Spada) are currently
involved in certain criminal proceedings that stem from a complaint filed by Linkem S.p.A. on October 14, 2016.
It is alleged that EOLO used certain frequency bands without having received the relevant authorization by the
competent authority. The frequency range (3.8-4.2 GHz) was used after having filed a “statement for
experimentation” with the MED. EOLO used the frequency range until October 7, 2016 when the MED issued
the order to stop. More specifically the MED ordered to cease the use of the frequencies and payment of a fine
for approximately €200 thousand. The charges against our former and current managers are (i) aggravated theft
of unauthorized radio-frequencies; (ii) aggravated fraud against the Italian State concerning the unlawful
appropriation of radio-frequencies without the relevant authorization; and (iii) interference with the freedom of
business and trade (this third charge was dismissed by the court in November 2019).

In addition, EOLO has also been investigated for administrative liability according to the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 231 with reference to: (i) the criminal offence of aggravated fraud against the Italian State; and
(ii) interference with the freedom of business and trade (this allegation was dismissed by the court in November
2019). The public prosecutor alleged that EOLO’s procedures were inadequate to detect and prevent the
managers’ alleged behavior and would have generated for EOLO an undue profit of approximately €3.5 million
between 2016 and 2017, a sum which we demonstrated to the court we would be able to pay should a judgment
be rendered against us.

On January 25, 2021, the public prosecutor issued a motion to dismiss the remaining two allegations of
aggravated theft and aggravated fraud against the former and current managers. On February 15, 2021, Linkem
S.p.A. (an industrial competitor) filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and the new hearing is expected to
be held in November 2021. If the court rules again our former and current managers or EOLO, certain sanctions
might be imposed (including administrative fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of the profits related to the
alleged criminal conduct and certain ban measures, including prohibition of contracting with the Italian
government, exclusion from public funding and contributions and prohibition from advertising goods and
services). However, we have already implemented certain self-cleaning measures (e.g., we have strengthened our
system, including applicable controls and procedures under Decree No. 231) and our legal counsel has advised us
that the risk that the court will not authorize the dismissal is remote. As a result, we do not consider that these
criminal proceedings have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or
results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We are subject to Italian
_legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us to liability and sanctions_
_for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market abuse)_
_committed by persons within EOLO.”_

**REGULATION**

_The following provides a summary description of certain of the main regulations and regulatory initiatives that_
_govern the activities carried out by us in Italy. Although the following summary description contains the main_
_information concerning such regulations that are considered material by us, it is not an exhaustive account of all_
_applicable laws and regulations. References and discussions to treaties, laws, regulations and other_
_administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such treaties, laws, regulations_
_and other administrative and regulatory documents. See “Risk factors—Risk Related to our business and_
_industry—We are subject to extensive regulation and may in the future be adversely affected by regulatory_
_measures applicable to it.”_

**European regulatory framework**

Italian telecommunications operators are subject to the EU regulatory framework which includes directives,
regulations, recommendations and opinions on telecommunication. As a member of the European Union, Italy is
required to adopt directives issued by the EU, which, in certain cases, may have direct effect (i.e. when their
provisions are unconditional and sufficiently clear and precise and when they have not been transposed in the
Italian legal framework by the deadline), whereas regulations adopted at the EU level always have general
application and are binding and directly applicable to all EU member states.

On December 20, 2018, Directive 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communication Code (the
EECC) entered into force. The EECC establishes common European rules and objectives aimed at regulating the
telecommunications industry and defining how providers of networks and/or telecommunication services shall be
regulated by national authorities. The EECC’s provisions include measures to stimulate investment, new
spectrum rules for wireless connectivity and 5G, as well as changes to governance, the universal service regime,
end-user protection rules, and numbering and emergency communication rules. Some of the main goals of the
EECC include to increase competition and predictability for investments, facilitate the participation of smaller
players and first movers in investment projects and to improve coordination and use of radio-frequencies across
the EU (to be achieved by long durations of licenses, coordinated timing of assignments and stricter requirements
on effective and efficient spectrum use). Finally, in the interests of consumer protection, the EECC focuses on
the gaps where sector-specific needs are not addressed by general consumer protection provisions.

The EECC also provides general principles regarding the individual rights of use of radio spectrum, such as,
among others, that: (i) member states shall grant such rights, upon request, under a general authorization and
shall also specify whether those rights can be transferred or leased by the holder of such rights, and under which
conditions; (ii) the individual rights of use for radio spectrum shall be granted through open, objective,
transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate procedures; and (iii) the competent national authority shall
promptly grant and make public its decisions on the granting of individual rights of use for radio spectrum.

In addition, member states shall make available the general criteria for an extension of the duration of rights of
use of radio spectrum in a transparent manner, to all interested parties in advance of granting rights of use, and
such general criteria shall relate to: (a) the need to ensure the effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum
concerned, including by pursuing wireless broadband coverage of their national territory and population at high
quality and speed and by facilitating the rapid development in the European Union of new wireless
communications technologies and applications, or the need to fulfil goals related to ensuring safety of life, public
order, public security or defense; and (b) the need to ensure undistorted competition.

The Directive reviews and combines in one document the “Framework”, “Access and Interconnection”,
“Authorization” and “Universal Service and Users’ Rights” Directives (the revision of the Privacy and Data
Protection Directive, the so-called e-privacy Directive, is ongoing under separate proceedings). On the same date,
Regulation 2018/1971 also entered into force replacing the former BEREC (Body of European Regulators for
Electronic Communications) Regulation (EC) 1211/2009. Law No. 53/2021 of April 22, 2021, published in the
Italian Official Journal (Gazzetta Ufficiale) on April 23, 2021 and enforced since May 8, 2021, has set forth the
criteria and principles that must be taken into account by the Italian Government for the implementation of
Directive (EU) No. 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 into Italian law.

The EECC includes measures to promote wholesale-only models of investments and stimulate investments in
very high capacity networks (VHCN), new rules on spectrum (such as minimum license duration) to improve
certainty on investment return, changes to the regulation of services, introducing a more level playing field
between telecommunications operators and new over-the-top-players (OTT players), and the introduction, in the

157


-----

scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO), of the affordability for consumers (with low income or special
social needs) of adequate broadband internet access service and voice communications services at least at a fixed
location.

**Italian regulatory framework**

The principal of regulation governing the Italian telecommunications markets is Italian Legislative Decree no.
259/2003 (the Italian Electronic Communications Code (the “IECC”)). In addition, certain other aspects of the
applicable legal framework (including the regulation of the Register of Communications Operators (“RCO”) are
regulated by various AGCOM resolutions adopted by such authority in its role as regulator in the sector, pursuant
to Law no. 481/1995, establishing AGCOM’s powers, including, among others, the power to issue guidelines
concerning general quality service levels.

Under the IECC, the AGCOM and the MED together are entrusted to regulate the main aspects of the
telecommunications markets in Italy, comprising the mobile, fixed-line and Internet markets. Their regulatory
powers mainly include licensing, authorizations, access interconnection, frequency allocation, numbering,
universal service obligations, tariff regulation and the rebalancing and arbitration of disputes between operators.
The AGCOM is financed by telecommunications operators through a fee based on operators’ financial results.
The public numbering schemes are decided by the AGCOM while the MED is responsible for numbering
management and assignation.

In addition, the Italian Competition Authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, the
“AGCM”) enforces competition law rules which, among others, prohibit anticompetitive agreements among
competitors (i.e. cartels), and the abuse of dominant positions. The AGCM also supervises: (i) possible
acquisitions or mergers which may generate or strengthen dominant positions detrimental to general competition
and (ii) consumer protection issues and misleading advertising proceedings. The AGCM also has several other
functions and goals, including protecting consumers from misleading advertising or comparative advertising
which discredits competitors’ products or causes confusion, as well as protecting consumers against unfair
commercial practices.

According to the IECC, the individual rights of use of radio spectrum are granted by means of open and
transparent procedures set forth by the AGCOM, whereas the related fees are set up by the MED. In compliance
with the general European principles set out by the EECC, member states may decide that the number of
individual rights has to be limited in order to pursue a national public interest, such as promoting coverage,
ensuring the quality of service or promoting the efficient use of the radio spectrum, or the innovation and
business development. Therefore, the Italian authorities have imposed certain limitation of the individual rights
of use of radio frequencies aimed at promoting efficient use of the radio spectrum. In particular, the IECC states
that in case of insufficient resources (i.e. when it is not possible to share radio frequencies and when sharing
frequencies may cause risk of interference and/or may impair the quality of service) there is a limited number of
available individual rights of use, thus operators shall apply for specific licenses to be granted with the available
rights of use. In all other cases (i.e., when there are sufficient resources and the efficiency of the service is not at
risk), operators who have been granted with a general authorization can use the radio spectrum frequencies
without requesting any additional specific licenses. Individual rights are granted for a period that shall not be
longer than the duration of the general authorization granted to the operator to operate business activities in the
telecommunication business.

Following the introduction of the EECC in 2018, member states had to adopt, by December 21, 2020, the
required laws, regulations and provisions to comply with the EECC’s provisions. Through Law no. 53 dated
April 22, 2021, the Italian Parliament has delegated the Italian Government to implement the EU Directive
2018/1972, thus amending Italian Legislative Decree no. 259/2003 and integrating the EECC’s principles in the
IECC.

**_General Authorizations_**

Italian telecommunications operators must obtain a general authorization from the MED to provide electronic
communication services. The procedure to obtain the general authorization includes the following steps: (i) the
operator sends a notice to start its telecommunications services and can start offering such services from the
moment of the filing; (ii) the MED screens the notice and checks the operator’s requirements, and (iii) in case of
a positive result, within 60 days the operator is granted with a general authorization. General authorizations
generally do not last more than 20 years and they are extendable for an additional 15 years. When the rights of
use of radio spectrum frequencies are not limited by the Italians authorities for public interest reasons, the general
authorization provides for the relevant conditions of use of the frequencies. Conversely, when the rights of use

158


-----

are limited for public interest reasons, operators are required to obtain a specific license issued by the MED, in
addition to the general authorization. The AGCOM has set out a detailed open, transparent and
non-discriminatory public tender procedure to obtain such specific licenses based on an auction system.

Under the IECC, in order to be granted the general authorization to provide electronic communications services,
operators must file a declaration attesting, among other things, that none of their legal representatives have been
condemned to imprisonment for a time frame longer than six months, nor have they been subject to security or
precautionary measures under applicable laws. Once granted a general authorization, operators must continue to
satisfy such requirements for the duration of the general authorization and shall promptly inform the MED if they
fail to do so.

See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to our Business and Industry—We may incur liabilities for the actions of our
_directors, employees, agents and representatives or be excluded from contracting with public authorities for the_
_actions of our employees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We are subject to_
_Italian legislation related to the “corporate liability of legal persons” which could subject us to liability and_
_sanctions for offenses (including corruption, fraud against the Italian State, corporate offenses and market_
_abuse) committed by persons within EOLO.”_

The MED’s approval is required for any transfer of a general authorization (in case of merger, acquisitions, and
other transactions, including the Acquisition) and the MED may reject the request for approval in the event that
the transferee does not comply with the necessary requirements. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion_
_of the Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.”_

We obtained the following authorizations by the MED to supply electronic communications network and services
throughout the national territory pursuant to IECC: a) General Authorization for Internet Service (ISP), issued in
2006; b) a WISP (WIFI Internet Service Provider) authorization issued in 2005; c) a VOIP (Voice over IP)
authorization issued in 2006; and d) a General Authorization for the supply of electronic communications
network and services, issued in 2014.

These authorizations: a) have a duration of twenty years, extendable for a further 15 years and renewable upon
expiration (they will expire in 2034 and we will be allowed to request an extension until 2049); and b) under the
IECC are transferrable to other operators (the competent office of the MED shall previously authorize the
transfer and the MED may reject the requested transfer in case the transferee lacks the requirements for the
General Authorization).

**_Individual rights of use_**

In compliance with the general European principles set out by the EECC, member states may decide that the
number of individual rights has to be limited in order to pursue a national public interest, and the IECC states that
in case of insufficient resources (i.e., when it is not possible to share radio frequencies and when sharing
frequencies may cause risk of interference and/or may impair the quality of service) only a limited number of
available individual rights of use can be distributed to operators, thus operators shall apply for specific licenses to
be granted with the available rights of use. To evaluate whether resources may be considered insufficient, the
AGCOM has to take into consideration several principles, such as: optimize customers benefits; foster
competition development and investments sustainability; promote the effective and efficient use of frequencies;
allow all stakeholders the opportunity to submit their views. Under the EECC, the procedure to assign individual
rights of use of frequencies shall be based on objective, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory
criteria.

According to the EECC, each national regulatory authority shall consider and evaluate an extension request of
individual rights of use for radio spectrum in a timely manner (i.e., before the expiration of those rights, except
for rights of use to which the renewal has been explicitly excluded). When considering possible renewal of
individual rights of use for harmonized radio spectrum for which the number of rights of use is limited,
competent authorities shall conduct an open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure, and shall, inter alia:
(a) give all interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation; and (b) clearly
state the reasons for such possible renewal. In addition, the EECC also provides that the national regulatory
authority shall also take into account any evidence arising from the consultation of market demand. In any case,
the competent authority may review and change the fees as well as of certain terms and conditions granted/
provided in the previous license.

159


-----

In Italy, the procedure for the extension of the right of use involves both the MED and the AGCOM. As the first
step, an operator shall apply to the MED for the renewal (the application shall also include technical and
financial plans in order to justify the request of extension). Following that, the competent office of the MED
requires a positive opinion by the AGCOM to proceed with the extension of the right of use. Before the issuance
of such opinion, the AGCOM also takes in consideration the results of a stakeholder consultation so as to give all
interested parties the opportunity to express their views through a public consultation. In the past, in evaluating
the renewal of individual rights, the AGCOM considered (i) the consistency and adequacy of the technical and
financial plan on which the application was based; and (ii) the fact that other operators holding the same licenses
were already granted the extension. Based on the outcome of the public consultation and on the assessment of
mentioned factors, the AGCOM provides to the MED its opinion, and then the MED issues its decision.

The IECC does not specify the duration of the procedure to obtain the renewal of the rights of use. In case of a
denial of the extension, the MED can commence a new tender procedure to newly award the rights to use the
frequencies.

The MED’s authorization is required for the transfer of individual rights (in case of merger, acquisitions, and
other transactions including the Acquisition). Such authorization process also involves the competent offices of
the AGCOM and the AGCM which shall provide their opinions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Transactions—The Issuer does not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until completion_
_of the Acquisition and the Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.” The aim of such_
procedure is to ensure that the transfer of individual rights does not cause unfair competition and that such
transfer complies with the principles of the IECC (for example, promotion of competition, consumer protection,
in each geographical area, an operator is allowed to have individual rights up to 40% of the individual rights for
the Wireless Local Loop frequencies). In any case, the AGCOM and the AGCM may impose specific
requirements with respect to a proposed transfer requiring the sale or lease, such as selling or leasing individual
rights of use.

We currently hold (i) the rights of use for the 24.5-26.5 GHz (“26 GHz”) frequencies and (27.5-29.5 GHz)
(“28 GHz”) frequencies for all Italian Regions and the Autonomous Province of Trento and Bolzano (awarded in
2014, 2016 and 2018 and which expire on December 31, 2022); and (ii) the rights of use for the frequency
concerning the 3.4-3.6 GHz (“3.5 GHz”) in relation to the FWA system for the Region Valle d’Aosta (awarded
in 2008 and which expires on May 21, 2023).

Our licenses for the 26 and 28 GHz spectrum were awarded as a result of tender procedures carried out by the
MED in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Such licenses provide us with the right of use related to 26 GHz and 28 GHz
bands in all the Italian regions (included the provinces of Trento and Bolzano). These licenses will expire on
December 31, 2022. We submitted to the MED and the AGCOM the following extension requests: (i) in relation
to the 28 GHz individual rights to be extended at least until 2029; and (ii) in relation to the 26 GHz individual
rights to be extended at least until 2029. We currently expect that the extension procedure will be finalized by
end of 2021 for the 28 GHz spectrum and approximately at the beginning of 2022 for 26 GHz spectrum.

With respect to the 3.5 GHz spectrum, the relevant license was awarded by the MED in 2013, which also
provides the right to use the 3.5 GHz spectrum in the Valle d’Aosta region. The latter will expire on May 21,
2023. The additional licenses for the 11-13-18-80 GHz spectrum will expire in 2034.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Our ability to obtain all licenses, permits, rights
_of use or other authorizations required to operate our business and/or expand our network or any other required_
_licenses, permits or other authorizations is subject to risks and uncertainties” and “Business— Licenses and_
_Authorizations.”_

practicable following the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Certain _Relationships_ _and_ _Related_ _Party_
_Transactions—Management Co-Investment Plan.” The Shareholder Agreement contains other customary_
provisions regarding confidentiality and non-compete undertakings and information rights.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**General**

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in the ordinary
course of our business. During the period under review, we entered into certain non-material transactions with
ELMEC Group, controlled by Trub S.p.A., a minority shareholder of Cometa. We believe these transactions are
on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our affiliates than they would expect to negotiate with
disinterested third parties. See note 35 to the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended
March 31, 2021, and note 35 to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Information.

**Management Co-Investment Plan**

On or following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Sponsor plans to implement a management incentive
participation program pursuant to which management may subscribe for certain equity instruments of Holdco,
either in the form of classes of shares or in the form of participating financial instruments (strumenti finanziari
_partecipativi). Participants in the management incentive program will be entitled to receive a preferential return_
on the invested amount upon the occurrence of certain liquidity events (such as, among others, a change of
control of the Target or a listing process), which amount shall be calculated on the basis of the money-on-money
multiple achieved by the Sponsor in connection with the Transactions.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to the_
_Indenture after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the_
_applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the_
_actual agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries and not otherwise defined in this offering_
_memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into a new super senior revolving credit facility
agreement with, among others, the Issuer, UniCredit S.p.A. as the Security Agent, the facility agent named
therein as Agent, and UniCredit S.p.A., Natixis S.A. – Milan Branch and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE as
mandated lead arrangers (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement provides for a new super senior revolving credit facility in a principal amount of €125.0 million (the
“Revolving Credit Facility” for the purposes of this description).

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer and certain of its restricted subsidiaries which may
accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers of that facility (the “SSRCF
**Borrowers”) and may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly): (A) the consideration and all other**
amounts payable in connection with the Acquisition (including any payments, completion account-related
payments, purchase price adjustment payments (however structured), deferred consideration payments, earn-out
payments, put/call arrangement payments and any other similar arrangements or payments relating thereto and
any other amounts required to be paid under or in connection with the acquisition documents); (B) the
refinancing, discharge and/or acquisition of existing target debt (including back-stopping, replacing and/or
providing cash cover in respect of any letters of credit, guarantees or similar instruments or ancillary, revolving,
working capital or local facilities or other arrangements) and paying any breakage costs, redemption premium,
make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such refinancing, discharge and/
or acquisition; (C) any other purpose or payment contemplated by the tax structure memorandum, the funds flow
statement or the Note Documents; (D) other related amounts, including fees, costs, expenses, liabilities, taxes
(including stamp duty) and other amounts, including those incurred in connection with the Transaction, the tax
structure memorandum and/or the Transaction Documents (including any required arrangement, up-front or any
original issue discount fees or similar fees, any additional original issue discount or other fees arising as a result
of any market flex, and any ticking fees required to be paid in connection with, and any interest accruing on, the
Transaction Documents); and/or (E) the general corporate purposes and/or working capital requirements of the
Group (including the target group from the Acquisition Closing Date) including, without limitation, the
financing, refinancing funding, refunding or prefunding of capital expenditure, any permitted acquisition,
transaction costs, net working capital adjustments or bridging to target cash for the Acquisition and any other
permitted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, operational restructurings and reorganization requirements
of the Group, financing, refinancing, replacing, cash collateralizing, back-stopping or discharging financial
indebtedness of the Group or any acquisition target and paying any related breakage costs, redemption premium,
make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such financing, refinancing,
replacing, cash collateralizing, back-stopping or discharging, any required original issue discount fees or any
additional original issue discount fees or funding any ticking fees required to be paid in connection with and any
interest accruing on indebtedness (including, in each case, drawing the proceeds thereof onto balance sheet to
finance such items in the future and/or refinance previous expenditure on such items).

The Revolving Credit Facility will be available in euros, sterling, U.S. dollars and certain other currencies readily
available in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit and
ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to the other permissions under the limitation on
indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness covenant) to
incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or any additional notes and/or other facilities or notes documented
outside the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) up to (after taking into account the commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility) an aggregate amount of the greater of €150.0 million and 130% of LTM EBITDA (as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”).

167


-----

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the issue date of the Notes (the “Closing
**Date”) to (and including) the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.**

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR or,
for loans denominated other than in Euro, LIBOR, or, as applicable, the relevant Compounded Reference Rate,
plus an applicable margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of
consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (the “Consolidated Senior Secured
**Net Leverage Ratio”).**

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans
made under the Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility from the Acquisition Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be
payable quarterly in arrears (provided that the Obligor’s Agent may elect that the accrued commitment fee shall
instead be payable on each quarter date), on the last day of the availability period and on the date the Revolving
Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating
thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be repaid on the date falling seventy-eight (78) months from the Acquisition Closing Date. Amounts
repaid by the SSRCF Borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject
to certain conditions.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments. The Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon
a “Change of Control.”

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be defined as per the Notes,
including a change of control with respect to the Third Party Security Provider (or any successor entity) ceasing
to own 100% of the shares in the Issuer, but the proviso to the definition of “Change of Control Triggering
Event” shall not apply.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by each Guarantor on a joint and several basis.

The Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same security interests as for the Notes as set forth under
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80% of Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) are guarantors of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement (i) on the earlier of (x) 180 days following the Merger Date and (y) 60 days after the date
falling 18 months following the Closing Date; and (ii) thereafter on the date when the annual financial statements
of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters

168


-----

set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such requirement at (ii) above is not
satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 180 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to certain
agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status, binding obligations,
non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, validity and admissibility in evidence, governing law
and enforcement and pari passu ranking; (ii) no insolvency, no litigation and taxation; and (iii) no default,
financial statements and base case model.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date of each
utilization, on the first day of each interest period (other than in the case of roll over cash drawings) and at certain
other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted subsidiaries to observe
certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and grace periods,
including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) center of main
interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security and further assurance; (v) compliance with sanctions and anticorruption laws; and (vi) certain conditions subsequent to the Transaction.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
fall-away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing which does not
constitute a change of control and in respect of which the Group’s senior secured net leverage ratio does not
exceed an agreed ratio; or (ii) the Issuer or the holding company of the Issuer having a long-term corporate credit
rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services Limited or BBB- according to
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the
Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to
customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) inaccuracy of a representation or statement
when made; (ii) repudiation, rescission, invalidity and unlawfulness of the Revolving Credit Facility financing
documents; and (iii) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law
although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, and any other general undertakings contained in
Schedule 15 to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, events of default and related definitions scheduled to
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the definition of “Change of Control” and other definitions contained
in Schedule 17 to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer, certain
Guarantors and the Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent,
arrangers and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security Agent. We expect the
Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the Issue Date.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship
of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any

169


-----

other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider,
when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when
enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be
subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to
the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does
not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not

Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the
incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be
granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is
no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities
under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be
given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i)
over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit
support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation in relation
to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation
but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities (together
with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities”, the creditors in respect thereof being
the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following an Insolvency Event
(defined below), payments may only be made by the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received by
creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “Application of Proceeds” provided that there

174


-----

shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of
Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of
default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities (together being the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge
**Date”), the Issuer, the members of the Group and Third Party Security Providers may only make specified**
scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents
governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so
prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it or is otherwise permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second
Lien Liabilities and no Senior Secured Payment Default (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket
amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
**Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”),**
the Issuer, the members of the Group, Topco Borrowers and Third Party Security Providers may only make
specified scheduled payments to the Topco Creditors or any Topco Borrower (in respect of the Topco Liabilities)
or a Topco Investor (in respect of any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (together being the “Topco Group
**Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any holding company of the Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco**
Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments together being the
“Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility
document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the
Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit such
payment have been obtained or (y) required in connection with a Non-Distressed Disposal (as
defined below) or any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Finance Documents or for
claims and other proceeds sought before the occurrence of an acceleration event has occurred and is
continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction Security pursuant to such acceleration event,
(2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest (such other amounts
including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or liquidated
damages) the accrual of cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop
Notice is outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable but not
included in paragraph (1) above in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance
Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the

175


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of
the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency
indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program
approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority
Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy
letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other than
in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of
whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents):
(A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of
commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations (including
legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and any fees, costs
or expenses of the relevant Topco Agent (as defined below)not exceeding €1,500,000 in aggregate, but
excluding the costs of any litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their
affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect,
preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees (including
any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred in respect of
(or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing
requirements under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 in
any financial year of the Issuer, provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried forward and
utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first), (G) of any
amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop
Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been
capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding
as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or
any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain events
of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as
a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities documents which is continuing, all or part of
the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares
in any holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent
payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as
defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed
by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the
Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt
for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted
Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities owed by
any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash interest made by way of capitalizing interest or
issuing a non-cash pay instrument which is subordinated on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of
audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or
any other reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco
Borrower or an Affiliate thereof, (K) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of
Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) if the payment is made
by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such
payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment
is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without
breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco
Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment
upon illegality or any other provision that permits the repayment in full of the participation of any Topco
Creditor (without a related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors), including a provision (if any)
in a Topco Finance Document which is substantially equivalent to the prepayment of a single lender in the
event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (N) if no Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing the payment is a payment

176


-----

of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco
Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the
relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the
applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

A reference in the section above to a payment shall be construed to include any other direct or indirect step,
matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities which are otherwise prohibited under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security Providers
may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents
and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business Day after the
date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior
**Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of**
**Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured**
Creditors or Second Lien Creditors) gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered (a “Topco
**Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any**
Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for
the relevant Topco Payment Stop Notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the
Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of
default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event
of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement
**Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.**

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt

177


-----

Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco Investors”)
(in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments which had
accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and
which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second
Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the
“Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents
(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a
result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “Application of Proceeds” and in the case of Intra Group Liabilities, any amount received or
recovered in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or
recovered notwithstanding that an Acceleration Event is continuing);

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

178


-----

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for
(or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that
amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the Final
Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a
Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any
proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received
or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application
_of Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (being each original obligor
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security
principles that apply to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, each member of the Group that has an EBITDA
representing 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of
any resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration,
examination or reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment
or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a
result of any financial difficulty on the part of that Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider,
(c) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its
assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), (i) frivolous
or vexatious proceedings and which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20 business
days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised (or such other period as agreed between
the Issuer and the Instructing Group), (ii) (in the case of an application to appoint an administrator or commence
proceedings) any proceedings which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or (iii) as
permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or
otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall, to
the extent able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security
Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all
such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and, in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

179


-----

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, after the occurrence of
an Insolvency Event, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as
defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to
make recovery in relation to the Debtors, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider.
The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these
provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing
Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the
provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the credit participations of
the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured
**Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the credit participations of the**
Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions
relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in
accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before
the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the credit participations
of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors representing
more than 50% of the credit participations of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable,
if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement
instructions their respective representatives (and, if applicable, the hedge counterparties) shall deliver a copy of
those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties which did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors (x) determine in good faith that a
delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and (y) deliver instructions they reasonably believe is
consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as defined below) before the Security Agent has received any
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super
Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease
enforcing and have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors, where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the

180


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given
instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing and have not required
any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Topco Creditors who
are then entitled to give such instructions under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or
indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super
Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien Creditors,
with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group, (i) no
Topco Creditor or Topco Investor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the enforcement
of any Transaction Security (including the crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the Transaction
Security); (ii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action
(as defined below) against any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (other than
in each case (and to the extent not restricted by (i) above and (iii) below) against a Topco Borrower) in relation to
the Topco Group Liabilities; and (iii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor nor Topco Borrower shall take or
require the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below) in relation to Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities,
except in the case of each of (i) through (iii) as set out under “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below.

181


-----

Other than as restricted by (i) and (iii) in the paragraph above, any Topco Creditor may at any time take any
Enforcement Action (as defined below) against any person that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group, in
each case in accordance with the terms of the Topco Finance Documents.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the
Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default (the “Topco Event of Default”) under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

182


-----

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee or

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Topco Event of Default, a Topco Notes Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco
Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent under a Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), senior secured notes trustee, the Second Lien Agent
and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date;

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same

Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to a
Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect, by giving not less
than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have
been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors
must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in
exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging
obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

183


-----

irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from
any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer has
confirmed is the subject of:

consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to a
member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of
the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security;

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that asset
will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group (or, to the extent any
applicable Finance Document prohibits such transaction, the applicable Agent authorizes the

Creditor Consent for such transaction has been obtained),

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other agreement
requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to effect any amendment or waiver
or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in relation to such
document or agreement to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited
by any Finance Document;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the

the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Senior
Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt

Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to
a Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a transfer of all of the rights and obligations of any Super Senior Borrower, Senior Borrower or
Second Lien Borrower (a “Borrower”) in respect of its Liabilities (including borrowing liabilities) under
the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt
**Transfer”) provided that (A) either: (1) such Debt Transfer is to another member of the Group; (2) such**
Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any Holding Company of that Borrower is being
disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not
otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s borrowing liabilities
under the applicable Finance Documents; or (3) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an

disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the
extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such
member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such
person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial
securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing
Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration
event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the
occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of
the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor and
any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any
Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant
creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company or
any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra- group
lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the
assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose
of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to
creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities
owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

185


-----

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group
liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities) to
accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities
owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above in (iv)) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred pursuant to (iv) above, as if that disposal of
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to (iv) and (v) above) effected by, or at
the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in
the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price), and shall in all cases comply with
the requirements set out in the paragraphs below (as applicable) and act in accordance with them (as applicable).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or
other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that
release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be
paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management
facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior
creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer specified by such creditor, in which
case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities.

Subject to the paragraphs below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs
(vi) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of each Senior
Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further condition to any
release, transfer or disposal under paragraphs (i) to (v) above that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

186


-----

(ii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(A) pursuant to a competitive sales process; or

(B) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment bank, firm of accountants
or third party financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an
enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to
the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance
basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or
engage any investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser unless it shall have
been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction Security
securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer, or disposal under paragraphs (i) to (v) above that
either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent and each Second Lien Notes Trustee have approved the release, transfer or disposal;
or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor (a “Second Lien Guarantor”) in respect of
Second Lien Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other
liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors all claims of the Secured Parties and unsecured
creditors are sold or disposed of, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and in each
case all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of
the Secured Parties in respect of the assets of such members of the Group is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that if each Senior
Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee:

(I) acting reasonably and in good faith determine that the Senior Secured Creditors (collectively)
will recover a greater cash amount if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is
nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding amount of the Senior Secured
Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent
and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there
are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the
outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities); and

(II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such
purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser); and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the advice
of a reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment bank, firm of

enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select
or engage any investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm unless it
shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to paragraphs
(iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities and/or Transaction Security securing Topco
Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further
condition to any release, transfer or disposal pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement that either:

committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the
liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties) (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”); and

or enforcement of Topco Independent Transaction Security or any guarantees provided by a Topco Guarantor
(other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) (the “Topco Recoveries”) shall be applied at any time as the
Security Agent sees fit, in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any Agent Liabilities in respect of the Topco Liabilities (to the extent related to such Topco
Recoveries), the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate, on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Topco Creditor in connection with any
realization or enforcement of the Topco Independent Transaction Security taken in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) for application towards the discharge of:

(A) the Topco Facility Liabilities; and

(B) the Topco Notes Liabilities,

on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between paragraphs (A) and (B) above;

(iv) if none of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers or Topco Independent Obligors is under any
further actual or contingent liability in respect of the Secured Liabilities, in payment to any other person
whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider or
Topco Independent Obligor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the
Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent,
provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such

190


-----

amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected
class (or, in the case of hedge counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of (i) each of the agents
or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super
Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility
Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge
Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents
or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations
in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below) or as permitted by the Debt
Documents, (i) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party, (ii) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents,
amend, release and/or retake any Transaction Security Document where such amendment, release and/or retake is
required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created
under such Transaction Security Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by
reason of a failure to register such Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed
time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also
irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such
amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each party and (iii) the prior consent of (A) each of
the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the
Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (B) each Cash Management
Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would
not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (C) each
Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (D) the
Issuer is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating
Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction
Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which
are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected
without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any_
release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each
case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,”
“Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent

191


-----

effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be
effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to
provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or another applicable
agreement (but excluding any indenture), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten Business Days (or
any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a
shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be
deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant
confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company thereof) (an
“IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so
that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member
of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be
sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity” and if any Topco Liabilities are not refinanced in full on
or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Topco Borrower) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity and (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and
events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released
from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders
representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in
any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes
Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more
than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), the Issuer and each subsidiary of the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents
and from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (other than, in each case,
borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment,
release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

To the extent any step or action is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (or permitted subject to the
consent of specified parties under the Intercreditor Agreement), the parties agree that such step or action will be
permitted under the other Debt Documents (or permitted thereunder subject to the consent of such specified
parties) and if there is any conflict between the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any other Debt Document, the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail (save to the extent that to do so would result in or have the effect of any
member of the Group contravening any applicable law or regulation, or present a material risk of liability for any
member of the Group and/or its directors or officers, or give rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or
statutory duties), in each case notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the contrary, any provision
expressed or purported to override any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or the requirement to fulfil any
additional conditions, in each case, in any other Debt Document.

**Funding Loan**

On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will make available to Target the Funding Loan, using a
portion of the proceeds under Tranche B (as defined under “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The amount
borrowed under the Funding Loan will be used to repay the Refinanced Target Indebtedness of the Target, as
described under “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” Interest on the Funding Loan will accrue
at a rate that we anticipate will not be lower than the rate applicable to the Notes. The maturity date of the
Funding Loan will be on or about the maturity date of the Notes. The Funding Loan will be a senior obligation of

192


-----

the Target. The Funding Loan does not provide for any undertakings or representations by the parties. The
Issuer’s interest in the receivables under the Funding Loan will be assigned by way of security on a first-ranking
basis as part of the Post-Completion Collateral securing the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The
agreement regulating the Funding Loan will be governed by Italian law. As a consequence of the PostCompletion Merger, the Funding Loan will be terminated and the security interests over the Issuer’s interest in
the receivables in respect of the Funding Loan will cease to be effective.

See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer’s right to
_receive payments under the Funding Loan prior to the Post-Completion Merger (if it occurs) may be_
_subordinated by law to the obligations of other creditors.”_

**Shareholder Loan**

HoldCo, as lender, will grant an interest free shareholder loan to the Issuer, as borrower, for an aggregate
principal amount of €728.1 million (the “Shareholder Loan”). The Shareholder Loan will be entered into on or
about the Acquisition Closing Date and it will be governed by Italian Law. The Shareholder Loan will mature
after the maturity of the Notes offered hereby. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Shareholder Loan,
(i) the Issuer and HoldCo will agree that all their rights under the Shareholder Loan will be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and that, prior to the maturity date thereof, the Issuer shall only be permitted to make a
payment due under the Shareholder Loan to the extent such payment is permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the applicable finance documents (including the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), (ii) the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Shareholder Loan will be subordinated to the
Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future liabilities of the Issuer, and (iii) the Shareholder Loan
shall be subordinated to all current and future financial and non-financial liabilities of the Issuer, including with
respect to trade creditors.

**Rolled Target Indebtedness**

The Target is party to various bilateral facilities and overdraft lines agreements with local banks pursuant to
which certain short-term working capital, trade credit, overdraft facilities and guarantee facilities have been
obtained to finance operations and liquidity needs. We utilize these lines from time to time as part of our cash
management and our working capital requirements. As of June 30, 2021, as adjusted for the Refinancing, we
expect that approximately €15.9 million of bilateral and other credit lines will remain outstanding. Some of the
bilateral facilities include provisions regarding change of control and/or the merger and certain notices and
requests of waiver and/or amendments with respect to such provisions that are required to be agreed by the
Target with the relevant financial institutions in order for such credit lines to remain outstanding following
completion of the Transactions.

**Leasing**

The Target is party to a number of capital and operating leases with various expiration dates related primarily to
IRUs and BTS which will remain outstanding following the Refinancing. As of June 30, 2021, €89.2 million was
outstanding under such leases. We expect that these leases will remain outstanding after the Refinancing. See
“Capitalization.”

**Off-Balance Sheet Bank and Insurance Guarantees**

In the ordinary course of business, the Target is required to provide certain bank guarantees (fideiussioni
_bancarie) or insurance guarantees (polizze fideiussorie) for the purpose of guaranteeing its obligations under_
certain commercial agreements. Such guarantees are generally issued by commercial banks and under insurance
policies. As of June 30, 2021, the Target had obtained bank guarantees in an aggregate outstanding amount of
€6.3 million and insurance guarantees in an aggregate outstanding amount of €0.9 million.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior secured
notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A., a joint stock company (società
_per azioni) organized under the laws of Italy (the “Issuer”). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms_
used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this
“Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer only to Zoncolan Bidco S.p.A.
(not including any of its Subsidiaries) and any and all successors thereto (including, following the PostCompletion Merger, MergerCo (as defined below)).

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about October 21, 2021 (the “Indenture”),
between, inter alios, the Issuer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) under
the Indenture, UniCredit S.p.A., as security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) (the
“Security Agent”) and representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to and for the
purposes set forth under Article 2414-bis, 3rd paragraph of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security
**Representative”) and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not**
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including
Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust
Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those
requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain
relationships between it and us.

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, the Issuer will not control the Target, and the Target will not be subject to the covenants described
in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, the Issuer cannot assure you that prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Target will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had
those covenants been applicable to such entity as of and from the Issue Date and prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date.

If the offering of the Notes closes prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, pending consummation of the
Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Initial Purchasers will,
concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this
offering of the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated on or prior to the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Trustee
and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). The release of the
Escrowed Property (as defined below) from the Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement
within one Business Day following the release of the funds from the Escrow Account. If the conditions to the
release of the Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to April 17, 2022 (the “Escrow Longstop
**Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory**
Redemption (as defined herein). The Special Mandatory Redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of
the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein). See “—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

Upon release from escrow, the proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the
Issuer, together with the Shareholder Funding (as defined under “Summary—The Transactions”) and certain cash
available on the balance sheet of the Target, to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, downstream funds to
the Target to allow the Target to, among other things, repay the Refinanced Target Indebtedness (as defined
under “Summary—The Transactions”), for general corporate purposes and to pay costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions, as described further in this Offering Memorandum under “Use of proceeds.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make
payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of
certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for
a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

194


-----

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of the
terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject
to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will, on the Issue Date:

     - be general senior obligations of the Issuer and, subsequent to the Post-Completion Merger,
MergerCo, secured as set forth under “—Security;”

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer (or
MergerCo, as applicable) that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the
obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if
any;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer (or
MergerCo, as applicable) that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer (or
MergerCo, as applicable) that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;

     - mature on October 21, 2028; and

     - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in
priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations, if any. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—
_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future_
_indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a_
_“super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to_
_the Notes.”_

The Issuer is a holding company established in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating
operations of its own. As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not have any Subsidiaries. Following the Acquisition
Closing Date, substantially all of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through the Target. As a result,
prior to the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from the
Target to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the Notes)
and other obligations, and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments
governing our indebtedness, including any financing agreements of the Target. The Target may not generate
sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness,
including the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Capital Structure—The Issuer is a holding
_company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post-Completion Merger will_
_depend exclusively on cash from the Target to be able to make payments on the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may be unable to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the_
_anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will have no subsidiaries and the Notes will not be guaranteed.
Following the Acquisition Closing Date and prior to the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger, the

195


-----

Issuer will not have any obligation to cause the Target to guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of the Target, the Target will pay the holders of its debt and its trade creditors
before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the Issuer. The Notes therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) and minority stockholders
(if any) of the Target. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Capital Structure—The Issuer’s right to receive payments under the Proceeds Loans may be subordinated by law_
_to the obligations of other creditors.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will
mature on October 21, 2028. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to
monitor or enforce the minimum denomination.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 4.875% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30, commencing on March 31, 2022. Interest on the Notes
will be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the
date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

If the Issuer redeems any Global Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date
will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on
such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption
by the Issuer.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Notes will be made by
one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition,**
interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the
address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive payments on the Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is
not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (the “Paying Agent”). The initial Paying
Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a
transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the
initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. The
Issuer may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

196


-----

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €375.0 million aggregate principal
amount Notes will be issued in this offering. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”)
from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any
Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes originally issued, except in respect of any
of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates
for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Notes that are not fungible with the Notes
offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes or Italian tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN,
Common Code or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires,
for all purposes of the Notes Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed
to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional
Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they
have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one
series and references to such Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well
any such Additional Notes.

In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pertaining to
(a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, any mandatory
special redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such
Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing
or other transaction (such redemption, a “Mandatory Special Redemption”) and (b) the escrow of all or a
portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (ll) of the
definition of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent solely for the benefit of the holders of
such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes,
including Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the
Trustee or such security agent to enter into such arrangements provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such
Additional Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security
interest in the Collateral. In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such
Additional Notes are issued bearing a temporary ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, such as the consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such
Additional Notes bearing a temporary ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new

Additional Notes bearing the same ISIN or common code as any existing Notes issued; provided that such
Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes issued on the relevant issue date for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and Italian tax purposes.

**Post-Completion Merger**

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any
relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to implement the Post-Completion Merger in
accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of
Italian law, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing
Date (the “Merger Longstop Date”). Failure to complete the Post-Completion Merger on or prior to the Merger
Longstop Date shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture and the Issuer’s
obligations to use its commercially reasonable efforts shall cease on the Merger Longstop Date. Following
consummation of the Post-Completion Merger, all references in the Indenture to the “Issuer” shall refer to
MergerCo, unless the context otherwise requires. The Post-Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions
and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—We may be unable
_to complete the Post-Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

**Guarantee**

**_General_**

The Notes will not be guaranteed. Although there will be no initial Guarantors, in the event the Post-Completion
Merger does not occur on or prior to the date falling 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date (the “Cut-Off
**Date”), the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security**
Principles and to certain significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days
of the Cut-Off Date. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Target represented 100%, 100%
and 100% of the consolidated revenues, Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated assets of the Target (as the
Target had no subsidiaries).

In addition, if required by the covenant as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees”
and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations
pursuant to applicable laws, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public
Debt or certain other Indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent provided in future, any Guarantee will be a joint and several
obligation of each Guarantor.

For the purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” “Guarantor” means any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture on or after the Acquisition Closing
Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto).

The Agreed Security Principles apply to, and restrict, the granting of guarantees and security in favor of
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent
preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar
matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to
the Holders. Additionally, the Guarantee will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with.
See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee
_and the Security Interests” and “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The_
_Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.” The Guarantee_
will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will apply to, and restrict the
granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes,
which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be
restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

Each future Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain significant limitations pursuant
to applicable laws and be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations

198


-----

subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any
comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, thin capitalization and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will not have any obligation to cause the Target to guarantee
the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Target, the Target will pay the
holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the Issuer. The
Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) and minority stockholders (if any) of the Target. Prior to the Post-Completion Merger and,
in the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, prior to the granting
of the Guarantee by the Target, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness
or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target). In the event that the PostCompletion Merger does not occur and after the granting of the Guarantee by the Target (and subject to any
limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or
obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than the Target. After the Post-Completion Merger,
none of MergerCo’s subsidiaries is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally
subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of MergerCo. See
“—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees.”

**_Guarantee Release_**

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance
with the Notes Indenture, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge,”
respectively;

(4) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Future Guarantees”;_

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) as described under “—IPO Pushdown”;

(9) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Notes;

(10) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; or

(11) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation.”

Subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture and customary protections and
indemnifications, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, shall take all necessary actions at the
reasonable written request and cost of the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and/or the

199


-----

Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the Trustee, the Security Agent nor
the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the offering of the Notes closes prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, concurrently with, or prior to, the
closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account.
The Escrow Account will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders
of the Notes pursuant to an escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow
**Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends,**
distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds
paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

The Escrow Agent shall promptly release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), subject only to
receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Officer’s Certificate by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent with a copy to the
Trustee (upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be able to conclusively rely without further
investigation), on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, to the effect that:

     - the Acquisition will be consummated within one Business Day following the Release, on
substantially the same terms as described in this Offering Memorandum under the section
“Summary—The Transactions,” except for any waivers, changes or other modifications that will
not, individually or when taken as whole, materially adversely affect the Holders or to which the
Holders have consented; and

     - as of the date of delivery of the Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default under
clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “—Events of Default” below with respect
to the Issuer.

Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above does not take place on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date, (b) at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement
terminates at any time on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) Permitted Holders cease to beneficially own
or control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) a Default or Event of Default
arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default” on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date with respect to the Issuer (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer
will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the issue price of the Notes, plus accrued interest and Additional**
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined
below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, and will provide
that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by
the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”).
On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to
each Holder the relevant Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with
the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

To secure the payment of the relevant Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes a security interest in the relevant Escrow Account. Receipt by the
Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the Release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall
constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the Release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

200


-----

Amounts of the Escrowed Property may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date to pay negative interest charged on the Escrow Account (if any) and to pay interest on the Notes and any
Additional Amounts on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Release.

Pursuant to a shortfall agreement between the Issuer and Holdco to be entered on or about the Issue Date (the
“Shortfall Agreement”), Holdco will be required to contribute to the Escrow Account an amount equal to the
amount by which the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Escrow Longstop Date or the Issuer’s obligations to redeem the
Notes in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified with the consent of
Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security
interest in the Escrowed Property. See “—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

On or about the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and
ratable first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

     - 100% of the share capital of the Issuer held by the Third Party Security Provider (the “Issuer
**Share Pledge”); and**

     - any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Third Party Security Provider by the Issuer
(if any) (together with the Issuer Share Pledge, the “Completion Date Collateral”).

Within 20 Business Days after the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests
granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

     - 100% of the share capital of the Target held by the Issuer (the “Target Share Pledge”); and

     - the material structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by the Target, including under
the Funding Loan (together with the Target Share Pledge, the “Post-Completion Collateral”).

Following the Post-Completion Merger, in the event that the Target is the successor company of the PostCompletion Merger, MergerCo will, upon consummation of the Post-Completion Merger, assume the obligations
of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Concurrently with the Post-Completion Merger and as a result
thereof, the security interest over the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the Funding Loan will be automatically
terminated and depending on which entity will survive the Post-Completion Merger, certain other Collateral will
be extinguished by operation of law and, in particular, (a) in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of
the Post-Completion Merger, the Target Share Pledge, will be extinguished by operation of law; and (b) in the
event that the Target is the successor company of the Post-Completion Merger, the Issuer Share Pledge will be
extinguished by operation of law.

The Completion Date Collateral, the Post-Completion Date Collateral, together with any and all assets in respect
of which from time to time a Security Interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to
secure the obligations under the Indenture or the Notes and/or any Guarantee, in each case as may be in existence
from time to time, is referred to herein as the “Collateral.”

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain covenants—Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are_
permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including any
Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the
_value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be_
_secured by assets that do not secure the Notes.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed_
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

201


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain covenants—
_Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described above in this section)_
may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected),
in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis the liabilities under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, as well as certain Hedging Obligations (if any) and any Additional Notes
and may also secure certain future indebtedness; provided, however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) and
providers of certain future indebtedness will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in
priority to the holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See also, “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to_
_certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture_
_and the Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the_
_enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes.”_

In the future, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) and any Additional Notes in certain circumstances may also benefit from security which
does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_
_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_
_Intercreditor Agreement on a “super senior” basis are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement_
_of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.”_

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include,
among others:

     - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and
other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign
corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance”
rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee
consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may
require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee
or security will be limited accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security
Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten (10) Business Days but
without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to
such limit;

     - any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint
(including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party
arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being

202


-----

subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party,
supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the
applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend
any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the
asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the
Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security
document, provided that reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten (10) Business
Days but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third
parties) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the
Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that
the asset is material and the obligors’ agent is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve
placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- without prejudice to the security expressly set forth under “—Security,” no guarantees shall be
required to be granted by and no security shall be required to be granted by (or over shares,
ownership interests or investments in) any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority
interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group;

- for the avoidance of doubt, no member of the Group shall be required to grant a floating charge
(or any other privilegio speciale or other floating security, howsoever described) over its assets
located in any jurisdiction;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if
they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity
of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties
of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or
restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any
director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the
Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the
relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, use
reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten (10) Business Days but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or
security document shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration
and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be
agreed between agent of the Issuer and the Security Agent given that the parties to the Indenture
have agreed not to opt for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to article 15 and subsequent of
Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended and supplemented from time to time,
security that requires payment in Italy of an ad valorem registration Tax on the amount of the
secured obligations will not be taken (i) unless it can be executed by way of exchange of
correspondence or in any other form required under the applicable law (other than Italian law)
governing the relevant security which does not give rise to any such ad valorem registration Tax,
or (ii) if Tax duty cannot be minimized upon execution, including by securing only the relevant
grantor’s own obligations as borrower;

- to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the
secured parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all
the secured parties); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the
Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents) provided that in no event will
“parallel debt” provisions apply to Security Documents governed by Italian law;

- no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or
security as a result of any assignment, sub participation or transfer by a secured party (and unless
explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Notes Documents no member of the Group shall bear or
otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees or any other costs,
fees or expenses that result from any assignment, sub participation or transfer by a secured party);

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

203


-----

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time)
will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the
Notes Documents prior to the occurrence of applicable acceleration event which is continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
_Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA;_

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be
required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative
appointed by them at the relevant time) unless (i) required for such documents to become effective
or admissible in evidence, and (ii) an applicable acceleration event is continuing;

- where possible, the Security Documents governed by Italian law will be executed by way of
exchange of correspondence (scambio di corrispondenza commerciale), or outside Italy, in order
to minimize any documentary tax cost connected with their execution;

- a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of
the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial
costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of the Group and all applicable
legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of
obtaining such guarantee or security;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than
in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or
prevent the creation of Liens over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document);

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over
certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the
security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as
otherwise permitted by the Notes Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all
contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights,
benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an applicable acceleration event which is continuing),
and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or
not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph;

- in each case if requested by an agent of the Issuer: No guarantee or security will be required to be
given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with
respect thereto) which are required to guarantee, secure or otherwise credit support Acquired
Indebtedness or Indebtedness permitted under the section “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” (or in each case Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness)_
(“Applicable Debt”) to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted by the Notes Documents to
remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired
pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Indenture shall be required to become a guarantor
or grant security with respect to any Notes Document if prevented by the terms of the
documentation governing the Applicable Debt or if becoming a guarantor or the granting of any
security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation
thereto. No security or Lien in favor of the other secured parties will be granted or continue to
subsist over any asset of the Group secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness
(including Applicable Debt) and to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien;

- all security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets
located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security;

- share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that
subsidiary;

204


-----

     - no action in relation to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or
registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated;
and

     - the guarantees and security to be provided in respect of the Notes in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles are only to be given by material subsidiaries which are incorporated in Italy
and not in any other jurisdiction.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and
may also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with respect to Security Interests among the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, secured by the Collateral, the Trustee, the
Security Agent, the Holders of the Notes and the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured
by the Collateral, respectively, is or will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, such
Hedging Obligations, or other Indebtedness, as applicable. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among
other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the
Collateral only after the claims of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and any
future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are satisfied. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.” In_
addition, in connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to be
secured on the Collateral, the Issuer may enter into Additional Intercreditor Agreements in compliance with the
Indenture on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Certain covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements;_
_Agreement to be bound.”_

**_Security Documents; Enforcement of Security Interests_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of
the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into
by, among others, the relevant security provider, the Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties
(and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, also as Security Representative and legal
representative (mandatario con rappresentanza)), and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by
Italian law, the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the Indenture. The Security Agent
will also act in the name and on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties
under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral
until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests
with respect to the Notes may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the
Security Interests in the name and on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. The Security Documents
will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent (including in
its role as Security Representative). As a consequence of such contractual provisions and since the Holders are
not a party to the Security Documents, holders of the Notes will not, individually or collectively, be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent
(including in its role as Security Representative) or the Trustee (as applicable) under the Indenture. To the extent
permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture,
holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the
Security Agent for the enforcement of the Security Interests. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will
restrict the ability of the holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the
Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act in the
name and on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interest in favor of such parties.

205


-----

In the event that the Issuer or the Target enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security
Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts
under the Security Documents. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral.”

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect,
invest and dispose of any income therefrom. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of
Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have,
and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have appointed for the purposes of Article 1704
(mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian Civil Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and mandatario
_con rappresentanza under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness,_
including the Security Documents.

Furthermore, each Holder will be deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as mandatario con
_rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf and as representative_
(rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the
Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification,
amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent in its name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

     - consented and agreed to be bound by the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the
provisions described under _“—Certain_ _covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_ _Agreements”_
(including, without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the
Guarantee and the Security Interests, including upon an enforcement);

     - authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to
enter into the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” and to be bound thereby and to perform their_
respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;

     - appointed and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to give effect to the provisions in the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

     - agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of UniCredit S.p.A., as representative (rappresentante)
of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, third paragraph of the Italian Civil Code; and

     - agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered
into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_

206


-----

**Release of Liens**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture_
or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon
in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan
receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization
Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject
to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a future Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and Capital Stock issued by, such future
Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Defeasance” and
“Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “Merger and Consolidation”;
_provided that in such a transaction where the Issuer or future Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien on_
the Capital Stock of the Issuer or such future Guarantor will be released and, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital Stock of the
successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing
Lien on the Capital Stock of the Issuer or such future Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder
of such Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with the Post-Completion Merger with respect to Security Interests over the
Completion Date Collateral or the Post-Completion Collateral that are extinguished by operation of
law;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and
Capital Stock issued by, such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the
Issuer as Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(10) as described under “IPO Pushdown”; or

(11) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantee, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is
required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely
solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described
above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the
Indenture.

207


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons attached,
as follows:

     - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the
Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

     - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”
In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream
will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable
rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000, and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and
any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Notes Indenture. It is expected that such
instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Notes Indenture will require the
transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any definitive registered Notes:

(1) For a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) For a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

208


-----

(3) For a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) Which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer of an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer will have no subsidiaries. On the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Issuer’s sole Subsidiary will be the Target, which will be a Restricted Subsidiary. Any Subsidiary which is
created following the issuance of the Notes will be a Restricted Subsidiary, unless designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. In the circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Notes
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not redeemable until September 30, 2024._

At any time prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon
notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including any
Additional Notes, upon giving notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to
103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to September 30, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem Notes, upon
notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from any
Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 104.87500% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date in an
aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes) issued under the Notes Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

At any time and from time to time on or after September 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or
in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the percentage of
principal amount of the Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during
the period beginning on September 30, of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the

209


-----

Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all
Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the
price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer (provided
that such price shall not be less than 100% of the principal amount) plus, to the extent not included in the tender
offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of
such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the Notes Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be
outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Issuer or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at
least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer,
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such
determination.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice.”

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as set forth above under “—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer is not
required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However,
under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under “Change of
_Control” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book- Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through
Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of selection the Notes will be
selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains
outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or
less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to
a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a
transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset
Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption
or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase
was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or
purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any
time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied

210


-----

or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price
and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single
notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any
such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption
dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption
date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance
with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will
notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Definitive Registered Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a
portion of the original Definitive Registered Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them
called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined
below under “Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, protocols, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of
the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving
rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date,
such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is
obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such
successor Person becomes a party to the Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after
the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Notes Indenture.

211


-----

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been
satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking
reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor has been or
will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept
and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive
and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor or a successor of the Issuer or Guarantor (each,
a “Payor”) on the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required
by law or by the applicable taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Italy or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of a Payor (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent), or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant
**Taxing Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor on any
Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will
pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders, after such withholding, deduction
or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than
the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable
for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the
existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) or
the beneficial owner of a Note and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation,
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in
each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or
the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture
or any Guarantee in respect thereof;

(2) any Tax, to the extent that such Tax is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor, a Paying Agent, or
other person acting as an agent for the Payor or a Paying Agent, addressed to the Holder, after
reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding is payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other

212


-----

reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of all or part of such Tax;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or
other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;

(6) any Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any amended or successor version of such sections that is
substantially comparable) (the “Code”), any current or future regulations thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or agreements (including any intergovernmental agreement or any laws, rules
or practices implementing such intergovernmental agreement) entered into in connection therewith
or otherwise pursuant to any agreements described in Section 1471(b) of the Code;

**(7)** any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are for or on account of imposta sostitutiva (pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time
(“Decree No. 239”)) and any related implementing regulations, or pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree
**No. 461”) and any related implementing regulations, provided that:**

(i) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required under
Legislative Decree No. 239 in order to benefit from an exemption from imposta sostitutiva have
not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Payor or their agents; and

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, (A) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any
Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or
a non-Italian resident individual which is subject to imposta sostitutiva by reason of not being
resident in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (the
“White List”) and (B) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes to the
extent such Taxes are for or on account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to
_imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date by reason of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree_
No. 461 or any change in the White List; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the
Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such Tax resulting in Additional
Amounts would not have been imposed or such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of
Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy of such
payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so
payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders

213


-----

on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to
the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal,

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or a purchase of Notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges
or levies (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable expenses with respect thereto) or any
other excise, property or similar Taxes (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable
expenses with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after the Issue Date or (B) to the extent
that such stamp, issue registration court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes or
similar charges or levies become payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is
not required by any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation
to the Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto), and the Payor agrees to
indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, and any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency
thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a
change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently
therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “Optional
_Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or_
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount
may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control
**Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid**
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any
Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of
Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the
Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10
days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in
advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by

214


-----

virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement that permits the Revolving Credit Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain
events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover,
the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event
may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the
Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering
Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a
notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon
such Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event
has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**IPO Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall
be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate
(with effect from the date specified in such notice and, in respect of the Target Share Pledge, provided that such
date falls on or after the date on which the Post-Completion Merger is completed) as described in “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security_
Agent shall be required (at the expense of the Issuer) to enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security Documents required
by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by this paragraph. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Guarantee—There
_are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_
_Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your_
_further consent.”_

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of
doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that (x) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and (y) no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion
Date, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants (the “Suspended
**Covenants”):**

     - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

     - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

     - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

     - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

     - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

     - “—Future Guarantees”;

     - “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

     - “—Limitation on Activities of the Third Party Security Provider,” and

     - provisions of clause (3)(i) of the first paragraph under “Merger and Consolidation—Issuer.”

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and will be
applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or
assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently
attains Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such
time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided that no Default, Event of Default or breach
of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and
none of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended
Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such
actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during
such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is
referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(A) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

216


-----

On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted
Liens pursuant to paragraph (k) of such definition.

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” above had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension_
Period and accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted
under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.”

Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action
described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period_
shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”

On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract
and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

Any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant
Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock, provided that the Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Indebtedness”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed:

(A) an amount equal to the greater of (x) €150.0 million and (y) 130% of LTM EBITDA; plus

(B) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date,
after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 3.4:1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under
paragraph (A) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio under this paragraph (B) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date);
_plus_

(C) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement secured by
a Permitted Collateral Lien but is not Senior Secured Indebtedness (“Junior Secured
**Indebtedness”) such that, on the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to such**
Incurrence (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed

217

3.9:1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (A) above on the date of
determination of the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the
calculation of Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio under this paragraph (C) on such
date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation
made on any such subsequent date); plus

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior
Secured Indebtedness, such that, on the date of determination, on a pro forma basis for such
Incurrence (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (I) the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 4.4:1.00 or
(II) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least
2.00:1.00 (in each case with any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (A) above on the date
of determination of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under this paragraph (D) on such date of determination but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent
date),

_provided that in each case any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred_
or deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) may at any time without restriction, condition or use
of other permission (A) be refinanced at any time if the principal amount of the Indebtedness Incurred in the
refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to
be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) on the date of determination for such refinancing and (II) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness being
refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees
and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred (including tender premiums), penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued
and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees,
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees, or similar fees in respect of the
Indebtedness Incurred to effect such refinancing) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing);
and (B) to the extent of any voluntary prepayment, buyback or cancellation of any facility relating thereto
shall (without double counting) be permitted to be incurred at any later time up to such amount prepaid,
bought back or cancelled;

(2) any (A) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) without limiting the covenant under “—Limitation on
_Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing_

such Indebtedness or other obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer; and (B) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed in each case, to constitute an
Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4)

(A) Indebtedness of the Target and any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding as of the Acquisition
Closing Date or Incurred under a facility committed or available for utilization and as in effect

assets), Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or capital expenditure or other
or similar transaction or (y) of Persons that are, or secured by any assets that are, acquired by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Issuer or a

Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or capital expenditure or other or
similar transaction and without giving effect to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to

the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (1)(D) of the second paragraph of this

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Indebtedness or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph
of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item of Indebtedness and will only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this
covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the clauses of the second paragraph,
and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clauses (1)(B), (1)(C) and (1)(D) of
the second paragraph of this covenant), if at any time that the Issuer would be entitled to have
Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses (1)(B),
(1)(C) and (1)(D) of the second paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless

under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that

this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the
date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,

determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

222


-----

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the
second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the

issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or usage of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings
and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either at the Applicable Test Date or: (A) be
determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in
commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion
thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter, agreement or instrument, which may be conditional,
including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such facility or commitments
become available (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion
thereof) has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other
provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other
provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be
borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances)
on a date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph (A) shall be (in each case, solely to the extent
that such committed amount, when borrowed or reborrowed, would constitute Indebtedness) the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to
the extent of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such sub-paragraphs); or (B) be determined on the date such amount
is borrowed or utilized pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the
Issuer may revoke such determination and/or make an alternate determination at any time and from
time to time;

(9) (without prejudice to any other permitted basis as elected by the Issuer for calculating the conditions
set out below otherwise permitted by the Indenture) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition (including an acquisition of assets),
Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, capital expenditure or other or similar
transaction, (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are, or secured by assets that are, acquired by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (y) commits to an
acquisition or transaction pursuant to which it may Incur Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a
Change of Control or a Permitted Change of Control, the date of determination of LTM EBITDA,
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the Applicable Test Date or: (A) any date that a
commitment, letter or agreement, put option or similar arrangement (conditional or otherwise

223


-----

(including any documentation condition)) for such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control is entered into and the LTM
EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, transaction, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and
the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for
the avoidance of doubt: (i) if any such ratios or covenant baskets are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such ratio or covenant baskets (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated
EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such ratios or covenant baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of
such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction
and any related transactions are permitted hereunder; and (ii) such ratios or covenant baskets shall
not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control; provided that if the Issuer elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or
similar arrangement, (I) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement
and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is
terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (II) to the extent any covenant
baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the
earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction or the date such agreement is
terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction but any
calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not
reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated, unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens is conditional or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction; or (B) the date
such Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control or Permitted Change of
Control occurs;

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is subject to a Permitted Change of Control, the
calculation of LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio or any component thereof (each an “Applicable Definition”) for the purposes of, at the
election of the Issuer: (x) the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event; (y) the Incurrence of
any Indebtedness in connection with a Permitted Change of Control; and (z) the making of any
Restricted Payment in connection therewith may be (without prejudice to any other permitted basis
as elected by the Issuer for calculating the conditions in paragraph (x) to (z) above otherwise
permitted by the Indenture): (A) by reference to, at the election of the Issuer, either: (I) if no
financial statements have yet been delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, the Issue
Date, with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to the financial information set out in
this Offering Memorandum; (II) the most recent quarter end date for which financial statements have
been delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, with such Applicable Definition
determined by reference to such financial statements; or (III) the last date of the most recently
completed Relevant Period for which the Group has sufficient available information to be able to
determine such Applicable Metric (with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to such
available information) on or prior to (1) any time of any commitment, letter or agreement
(conditional or otherwise (including any documentation condition)) to enter into the relevant
transaction which would on consummation result in a Permitted Change of Control; or (2) the date
upon which the Permitted Change of Control occurs (the “Applicable Test Parameters”); and
(B) pro forma for any Indebtedness expected to be repaid on or prior to the completion date of the
Permitted Change of Control, and any reduction in such ratio after giving pro forma effect to the use

224


-----

of proceeds arising in connection with the Permitted Change of Control (including any shareholder
injection, or increase to balance sheet cash received by the Group) and after giving pro forma effect
to synergies and cost savings arising from or relating to the Permitted Change of Control, and to the
extent satisfied by reference to the Applicable Test Parameters, such condition shall be deemed to be
satisfied even if such condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date or by reference to any other
applicable test parameters whether as a result of fluctuations in any basket, ratio or exchange rate
after such date without prejudice to the right of the Issuer to select any other Applicable Test
Parameters from time to time;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph or any clause of the
second paragraph of this covenant above measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at
the applicable date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing,
such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
indemnities, discounts, penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and
any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other costs, fees and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable and fees
in connection with such refinancing; and

(12) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS and in the case of any other Indebtedness, with the principal amount or the
liquidation preference thereof.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant and
_provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in_
the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted
value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased
amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold
under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on, at the Issuer’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was first committed, first Incurred or, with respect to any Indebtedness of the Target, as of the
Acquisition Closing Date, provided that notwithstanding anything in the Indenture, for the purpose of the
Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Issuer may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of
such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid
interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid
interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such
refinancing.

225


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

the equity of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise received by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (y) any net proceeds described in the preceding
subclause (x) shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for
distribution pursuant to clause (b) of this first paragraph of this covenant and shall not be
Excluded Contributions or Excluded Amounts; and (z) in the case that any net proceeds
described in the preceding sub-clause (x) are contributed to or received by the Issuer or the

(3) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each
case, portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including in each case as an Investment
pursuant to one or more of the paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Investment” and may aggregate
capacity in multiple paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Payments” above, the first paragraph of this

232


-----

covenant and/or in the definition of “Permitted Investment” in any manner that complies with this covenant.
With respect to the making of any distribution or other payment contemplated in this covenant including any
Restricted Payment and any Investment, compliances with any condition of this covenant shall be determined (at
the election of the Issuer) (i) on the date on which such distribution or payment is paid (ii) the date on which such
distribution or payment is declared or committed to be paid (conditionally or otherwise); (iii) as otherwise set out
in this covenant (and, in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination and elect another determination
date as contemplated above) and/or (iv) the Applicable Test Date.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value of the asset(s) or securities
proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face
amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be
determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this covenant or in the definition of Permitted Investment, no
Restricted Payment or Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Material Intellectual Property (or designation
of any Restricted Subsidiary holding such Material Intellectual Property as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) will be
permitted under the Indenture.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted
Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise acquire
Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and
to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such
purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or
any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except
(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (A) Permitted Liens; or (B) Liens on
property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Indenture are directly secured equally and
ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured
by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and (ii) in the case of any property or asset
that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the obligations under the Indenture pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge
of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and/or under the relevant Security Document.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness for borrowed money on its Material
Intellectual Property (such Lien, the “Initial Intellectual Property Lien”), except (i) Liens on Material
Intellectual Property described in one or more of clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (k) (to the extent not securing
Indebtedness for borrowed money), (o), (q), (r), (y), (z), (bb), (hh), (qq), (rr) and (ss) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens,” (ii) Liens on Material Intellectual Property described in clause (k) of the definition of
Permitted Liens securing Indebtedness for borrowed money that will be repaid and discharged in connection with
the Transactions and (iii) Liens on Material Intellectual Property that are not otherwise permitted under this
covenant if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are
directly secured equally and ratably with the Indebtedness for borrowed money secured by such Initial
Intellectual Property Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured (clauses (i), (ii) and (ii), together,
“Permitted Intellectual Property Liens”).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,

233


-----

accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) with
respect to the Issuer, any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on
the Issue Date and (d) with respect to the Target (and any Subsidiary thereof) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Acquisition Closing Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security
Documents and the Escrow Charge;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of
assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant
to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered
into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company (as_
defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such
Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when

(B) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the

(C) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other

Agreement, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date (or, with
respect to the Security Documents, the Acquisition Closing Date) or (ii) as is customary in

in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to
(14) of this paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions
with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the

235


-----

shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (x)
€23 million and (y) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalent Investments or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by
the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Permitted Indebtedness (in each
case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior
Secured Indebtedness, any Refinancing Indebtedness, or any other Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Indebtedness secured by a Lien on property or assets
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Permitted Collateral Liens) within 365 days
from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, provided that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness
and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, provided further that to the extent the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Senior Secured
Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended such offer to the Holders of the Notes
on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured
Indebtedness (including any Holders of Notes) elect not to tender their Senior Secured
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have
applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this clause (a),
and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that a binding agreement or
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash
will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an
“Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash are applied in connection therewith,
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a
“Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further
_that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such_
amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided that (i) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance_
with paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture;
(ii) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net
Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no
earlier than the earliest of execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or
consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to
and in accordance with paragraph (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition; and (iii) notwithstanding
any term of this paragraph, to the extent that (I) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any
Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance
and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors, AIFMD and
any other law or by any organizational documents or any agreement) or (II) a distribution of any or all of the
Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary

236


-----

(to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this paragraph.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under
the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant or such later date as set
forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant, or such earlier date as the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiaries may elect) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of €23 million and 20% of LTM
EBITDA in a single transaction, the Issuer will within ten Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset
**Disposition Offer”) to all Holders under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of any**
other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to, respectively: (i) repay the Notes (and only to the extent any Notes
are outstanding) at par; and (ii) repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment,
prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations
of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to
the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction
or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60
days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in
such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an
Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the
expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period as provided above) or with respect to any unapplied
Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid
or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness provided that the Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Notes or other Pari Passu
Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition
Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition.
Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be
deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use such Net Available Cash for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
Euro that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor)
and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or
other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted (or reasonably expected to be converted) by the Issuer or such

237


-----

Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalent Investments within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal year, not to
exceed the greater of (x) €23 million and (y) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value) (with unused amounts in any fiscal year being carried
forward to the next succeeding fiscal year and amounts that will not be used in the subsequent fiscal
year being carried back to the immediately preceding fiscal year);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in paragraphs (1) to (6) above.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to the
Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing
the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €12 million and (y) 10.0% of
LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€17 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, provided that any
Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this clause
(2) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” above or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalent Investments and the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any

Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or any transaction arising out of, and any payments

amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in

Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute an

Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in,
or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or (B) due to the fact that a director
of such Person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer
(provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer or such direct or indirect
Parent Entity of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default.

If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary: (i) the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will

241


-----

reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” above or under one or more paragraphs of the definition of Permitted Payments or_
Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer; (ii) that designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary; and (iii) that designation must be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complies the preceding paragraph and this paragraph and was
permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements set out in the preceding
paragraph as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of
the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary
as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation (i) will be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary; (ii) will only be permitted if (A) the Indebtedness described in sub-clause (i) is permitted under the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second
paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro
_forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the Applicable Test Date; and (B) no Event of Default would_
be in existence immediately following such designation; and (iii) must be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of
such designation, by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies
with this paragraph.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports following the
Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, 150 days) after the end of
each subsequent fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022,
annual reports (the “Annual Financial Statements”) containing: (i) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years,
including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years
and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of
the Issuer; (iii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer,
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report
pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the
Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a
brief description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; provided that the information
described in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, 90 days) following
the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the
fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, quarterly year-to-date financial statements (the
“Quarterly Financial Statements”) containing the following information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the
Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as
to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the

242


-----

Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iii) an
operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Issuer or the Target or a change in auditors of the Issuer or the Target, a report containing a
description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) shall be prepared in
accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of
IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described
in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the
event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of
operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In
addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

With respect to periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, to the extent comparable prior period
financial information of the Issuer does not exist, the comparable prior period financial information of the Target
may be provided in lieu thereof. For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to
be material if the entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s LTM
EBITDA (calculated (i) in the case of an acquisition, including any pro forma adjustments in respect of such
acquisition and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding any pro forma adjustments in respect of such disposal) for
the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to
internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in
English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the
Stockholm Stock Exchange, the Italian Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, any recognized investment exchange (as
that term is used in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or any other exchange or market in any
jurisdiction or country) (each a “Regulated Market”) and the Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is
subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on
a Regulated Market, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,

243


-----

information, documents and other reports that the Issuer, such Parent Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the applicable Regulated Market pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon
complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the Issuer any Parent
Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the
applicable Regulated Market, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the
preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by
delivering the corresponding consolidated audited annual, quarterly and material event reports of (i) any direct or
indirect Parent Entity or (ii) the Target. To the extent that material differences exist between the management,
business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of the -Issuer or (i) any direct or
indirect Parent Entity or (ii) the Target, as the case may be, that is the reporting entity (if applicable), the annual,
quarterly and material event reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material
differences.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only. The Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, including
the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or documents related therein.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will procure that no Restricted Subsidiary will, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the
Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate,
supplement, release or otherwise confirm, modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of
Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens or Permitted Intellectual Property Liens, (ii) the Issuer, its Restricted
Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, the Post-Completion Merger or a
transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “Merger and Consolidation”, (iii) the Collateral may
be discharged and released or released and retaken in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
replaced or released and retaken, from time to time to (I) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or
inconsistency therein, (II) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (III) to add Collateral, (IV) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or
any Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with “—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation,” (V) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a_
successor Trustee or Security Agent, or (VI) to effect any Permitted Reorganizations or the Post-Completion
Merger and (v) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, the Security Interests in any manner that
does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above,
the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the
Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security
Agent from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the Issuer or the Board of
Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the
solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion
of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise

244


-----

subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other
modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from
any Holder.

**_Future Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any
Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is
or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the
Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior
to or pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness;
_provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become a Guarantor to the extent and_
for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to
or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules
or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain
limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Guarantees—
_Guarantee Release.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the_
granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein;
and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in paragraph (i) above, the Issuer,
the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security Agent shall enter into with the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that (A) such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the
correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement

245


-----

(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes); (iii) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the
Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes; (vi) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Transaction; (vii) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof; or (ix) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure
that the Notes are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. In formulating its decisions on such matters,
the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence
as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinions of Counsel.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, other than (i) in
accordance with the preceding paragraph; or (ii) with the consent of the requisite majority of Holders except as
otherwise permitted under “Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

Any amounts incurred on the basis of any basket, test or permission where an element is set by reference to a
percentage of LTM EBITDA (“EBITDA based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts are, at the time of
incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant basket, test or permission) be treated as
having been duly and properly incurred without the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default even in the event
that such EBITDA based basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation of that calculation.

If (i) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to
a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (ii) at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or
amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based basket.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or exceptions set
out in the Indenture, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify and may from time to time reclassify that
amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to include that amount or
transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may
at the option of the Issuer be split between different baskets or exceptions).

Any reference in the Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable
Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or Permitted Acquisition) which would
result in a cumulative increase to the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group (in an amount
determined by the Issuer by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma effect thereof and
any adjustments permitted by the Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”), from such date until the date on
which the Quarterly Financial Statements for the first quarter end date falling immediately after completion (or as
the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying Transaction are delivered to the Trustee, the
Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group for the purposes of all baskets, fixed amounts, ratios and
thresholds in the Indenture which include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA
shall be increased (on a pro forma basis) by such amount. If the value of any of the baskets, fixed amounts, ratios
or thresholds is subsequently decreased upon the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Financial Statements in
respect of the financial quarter immediately following completion (or as the case may be termination or
abandonment) of that Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease
shall be grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the
relevant baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year or calendar year (each an “Annual
**Period”) (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual**
Period may be increased by (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted
amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the
Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to
100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such
immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back
**Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual**
Period is increased in accordance with the preceding clause (i), any usage of such basket during such Annual
Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) firstly against any Carry Forward Amount;
(B) secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in
accordance with the preceding clause (i); and (C) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction referred to in
or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric, or other test or
condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall be deemed to have been
satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of determination under the Indenture and
irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) on any such date or thereafter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or
consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture that does not require compliance with a financial ratio
or test (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any basket with a fixed euro amount or based on a percentage of
LTM EBITDA) (and such amount a “Non-Ratio Basket Amount”) on the same date as any amounts incurred or
transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Indenture (including, without

248


-----

limitation, any Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) that requires compliance
with any such financial ratio or test (any such amount a “Ratio Based Basket Amount”), it is understood and
agreed that the Non-Ratio Basket Amount (and any cash proceeds thereof and any discharge of any Indebtedness
with the proceeds thereof) shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to such
incurrence of any Ratio Based Basket Amount.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person (other than in connection with the Post-Completion Merger), unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of England and Wales, Italy, any member state of the European Union,
or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada
or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer)
will expressly assume, by way of Supplemental Indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all
the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and all obligations of the Issuer under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (i) the Issuer or the applicable Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph or clause (1)(D) of the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be higher,
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that such supplemental indenture is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(5) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods) guarantees and security over
the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer or the
Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist
(provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Issuer cease to exist, security will be granted
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor
Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

**_Any future Guarantors_**

No future Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

249


-----

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(a) either (i) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction; or (ii) either (x) the
Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and all
obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and

(b) either (i) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or (ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(2) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets
to the Issuer or another Guarantor;

(3) the Issuer or any Guarantor from transferring any assets comprising shares or other equity interests
to a Third Party Security Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); provided that to the
extent that any Security Interest was previously granted over such shares or other equity interests and
that Security Interest would not, in accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the
shares following such transfer, the relevant Third Party Security Provider shall, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares or other equity interests transferred in
accordance with this clause (3) on substantially equivalent terms to any security interest previously
granted over such shares or other equity interests as soon as reasonably practicable following the
transfer;

(4) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor, provided that, if the Issuer is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation: (i) the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1), (4) and (5) of the covenant
described under “—Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and (ii) to the extent that any Security
Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not, in
accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving
entity, the direct Holding Company of the surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity on
substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such
predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(5) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity,
_provided that (other than in respect of the Post-Completion Merger), in the case of a consolidation,_
merger or combination of (A) the Issuer into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (1),
(2), (4) and (5) under “—Issuer” and (B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, paragraph (4) under
“—Guarantor,” as the case may be, shall apply to such transaction;

(6) any Permitted Transaction; or

(7) the Post-Completion Merger.

250


-----

This covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary. Nothing in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall prohibit, condition or restrict the
Transactions.

**Post-Completion Merger and Further Assurances**

Following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any
relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to implement the Post-Completion Merger in
accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of
Italian law, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, during the 18 months following the Acquisition Closing
Date. Failure to complete the Post-Completion Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note will be deemed to agree, for the purposes of Article 2503-bis (et
seq.) of the Italian Civil Code, to the consummation of the Post-Completion Merger and, in the event that the
Target is the successor company of the Post-Completion Merger, the assumption by MergerCo of all obligations
of the Issuer in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Documents in accordance with the terms of the Indenture upon completion of the Post-Completion Merger.

In the event the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
significant limitations under Italian law, the Target guarantees the Notes within 60 days of the Cut-Off Date. See
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee
_and the Security Interests” and “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The_
_Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, continued for 2 Business Days, if any,
on any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise continued for five Business Days;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture, other than those set
out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness under any (I) Hedging Obligations, (II) Subordinated Shareholder
Funding and (III) Ancillary Facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to the extent
that a Revolving Facility is available for drawing in order to refinance amounts outstanding under
such Ancillary Facility) for money borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment
**default”); or**

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
**acceleration provision”),**

and, in each case, the aggregate principal outstanding amount of any such Indebtedness, together
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or
the maturity of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) €35 million and (y)
30.0% of LTM EBITDA;

251


-----

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Third Party Security Provider, the
Issuer, or a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer, a Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (x) €35 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any judgments
covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more
than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such
judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not
promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the
greater of (x) €17 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, shall, at any time, cease to be in full
force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason
other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(8) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Guarantee of any one or more Guarantors
that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or
ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is a
Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee (the “guarantee
**default provisions”).**

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal
amount of all the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
(subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon such declaration,
such principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that
a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes notify the
Issuer of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clauses (if any)
after receipt of such notice.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration to accelerate the Notes, such principal and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the case of an
Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes (including
the accrued and unpaid interest thereof) will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with
respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default set forth in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph
of this covenant may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more
than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from
the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if
any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave
rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration
of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

252


-----

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default
(except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note
held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding 75% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture)) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of
the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with
its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or
Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right
to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the written opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60
day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of
such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after

253


-----

being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or
interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or
Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30
days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a
Default that has occurred and is continuing, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in
respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take
certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions and subject to compliance with the provisions described in “—Meetings of Holders
_of Notes” below, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent_
of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 75% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, an amendment or waiver
may not, with respect to Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating
to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “Optional Redemption” or
“Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms
of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture;
_provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the_
heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less than all or
substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a
whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

254


-----

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive
payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor
under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent
or the Holders or make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any
Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be issued
in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—Future
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the_
Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or
Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is
provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security Agent to any
Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit
Facility, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit
Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes;
_provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes_
being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

255


-----

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or
(b) the covenants described under the headings “Merger and Consolidation” and “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations_
and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall be entitled
to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, without further inquiry, including
Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in connection with
a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Indenture will not contain a
covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes Documents
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of
the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The
_Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events_
_of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions,_
the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee
default provision and the security default provisions described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”),
(4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default”
above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that the
beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of
Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

256


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee
or Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as
the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has
delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions
precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If
requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders
shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which
may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present
value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent that the Notes are
represented by Global Notes deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial
holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system.

**Meetings of Holders of Notes**

All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with Italian applicable laws and regulations. In
addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under “—Amendments and waivers,” in
accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the
convening of meetings of the Holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their interests, including,
without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the Notes or
the Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the
Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders of
Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than
one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any
further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further
adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; provided, however, that the
Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals,
as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the
amendment of the economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

257


-----

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and waivers,” and to the
extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Issuer may amend the economic
_terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50%_
_of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.” Any resolution duly passed at any such meeting_
shall be binding on all the holders of the Notes, whether or not such holder was present at such meeting or voted
to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting
of Holders of the Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil
Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” As such and
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to complying with the
provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the other provisions
described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes
on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the holders of the
Notes of the initial appointment, as of the Issue Date, of UniCredit S.p.A., as representative (rappresentante)
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Representative”) in order to
create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to
exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture each holder of the Notes from time to time, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to,
and accepted, the appointment of UniCredit S.p.A., as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the Holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders**
of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the Notes. If the
Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the Notes, the Noteholders’
Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request
by one or more Holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’
Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently
reappointed thereafter.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that,
except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any

258


-----

such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the
Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms will
include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if
the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of
acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will
give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or
in connection with the Notes and the Guarantee, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a
discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is
able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable
to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the

259


-----

Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a
joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to
certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it
Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action,
will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange will be approved, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America.
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any
suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee brought in any U.S. federal
or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and the Guarantee thereunder,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of
doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties
of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The
Security Documents will be governed by Italian law.

Stock subsequent to the commencement of the Relevant Testing Period but prior to or simultaneously with the
event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage
**Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to**
such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement, extinguishment
or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if
the same had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period; provided that the pro forma calculation
shall not give effect to (a) any Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred on such determination date
pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (5)(A) thereof);_
(b) any Fixed Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4)(A) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”; or (c) Fixed Charges
attributable to any Indebtedness discharged on such determination date to the extent that such discharge results
from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant

have been made by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the Relevant Testing Period or
subsequent to the Relevant Testing Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio Calculation Date shall, at the option of the Issuer, be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such
Permitted Acquisitions, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and
disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
LTM EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period. If since the
beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or
amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall
have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or
discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, disposed or discontinued operation had occurred
at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and

operations, as though such synergies, cost savings, restructuring charges and expenses, revenues, revenue
enhancements, capacity or capacity utilization increases, expense reductions, operating improvements or other
similar or other adjustments or initiatives had been fully achieved on the first day of the Relevant Testing
Period). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on
such Indebtedness shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, either (x) as if the rate in effect on the determination
date had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant Testing Period or (y) using the average rate in effect over
the Relevant Testing Period, in each case taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness. As determined in accordance with the Election Option (as applicable), interest on a lease
(including any Capitalized Lease Obligation) shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined
by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such lease in
accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to above or any other computation of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility or any other
Credit Facility available to be redrawn (including the Revolving Facility) may, at the Issuer’s option, be excluded
from such computation. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon
a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to
have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer
may designate.

For the purposes of this definition, Consolidated Interest Expense will be calculated using an assumed interest
rate based on the indicative margin contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such
Indebtedness or, if no such indicative margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Issuer in good faith.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
**Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented**
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
**Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global**
Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests will be issued only in
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit a
participant’s account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In
addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in
their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the
owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominee) will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee nor
any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes in
certified form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(a) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(b) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with
their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the

309


-----

beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive
legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar,
and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the
Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and
such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of fifteen
calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for
redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. We are also not
required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has
tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In
the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things,
to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a
holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Trustee or the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement
of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and
us to protect us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We, the
Registrar and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in
our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with
the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or their
respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so
redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in
respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance
with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest, additional interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. In turn,
the Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuer expects that

310


-----

standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of BookEntry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

     - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

     - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant; or

     - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global
Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any
currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the
request of the holders of such Notes, reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes in certified form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

311


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial
interest in the Regulation S Global Note upon receipt by the Trustee or the Transfer Agent of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon receipt by the Trustee or the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interests for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to

312


-----

transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only
through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent or the
Registrar, or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear,
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the Business Day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently_
_applicable in Italy and the United States and does not purport to address the tax consequences applicable to all_
_categories of investors, some of which may be subject to additional or special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences_
_of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium paid (if_
_any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, Italy or United States law as in effect on the date_
_of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such date._
_References in this section to holders of the Notes include the beneficial owners of the Notes. Terms defined under_
_each subsection related to Italy and United States tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for_
_such respective section. The statements regarding Italy and United States laws and practices set forth below_
_assume that the Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**Certain Italian tax considerations**

The statements herein regarding certain Italian tax consequences of the purchase, holding and transfer of the
Notes are based on the laws and published practices of the Italian tax authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any changes in law and interpretation occurring after such date,
which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The following is a summary only of the material Italian tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident
beneficial owners, although it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or tax advice. The
following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may
be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax
consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or
commodities) may be subject to additional or special rules. Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to
the Group will update this summary to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any such
change occurs, the information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Tax treatment of Interest_**

Decree No. 239 sets forth the applicable regime regarding the tax treatment of interest, premium and other
income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price and any relevant makewhole premium, hereinafter collectively referred to as “Interest”) deriving from Notes falling within the
category of bonds (obbligazioni) and similar securities (titoli similari alle obbligazioni), pursuant to Article 44 of
Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”), issued,
inter alia, by:

(a) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a
multilateral trading platform of EU Member States or States party to the European Economic Area
Agreement (“EEA State”) allowing a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax
authorities as included in the White List; or

(b) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are not listed, issuing notes traded
(negoziati) upon their issuance on the aforementioned regulated markets or platforms; or

(c) if not traded on the aforementioned markets or multilateral trading platforms, when such notes are
subscribed and held by “qualified investors” pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Legislative Decree
No. 58 of February 24, 1998.

For these purposes, bonds and securities similar to bonds are securities that (i) incorporate an unconditional
obligation for the Issuer to pay at maturity (or at any earlier redemption/repayment of the security) an amount not
lower than their nominal value or principal amount; (ii) do not provide to the holders any right of direct or
indirect participation in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with which
the Notes have been issued; and (iii) do not provide for a remuneration which is entirely linked to profits of the
Issuer, or other companies belonging to the same group or to the business in respect of which the Notes have
been issued.

_Italian-resident Noteholders_

Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity

Where an Italian-resident beneficial owner of the Notes ( “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is:

 - an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected;

 - a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) (other than società in nome collettivo and società in
_accomandita semplice or similar partnerships), a de facto non-commercial partnership or a professional_
association;

 - a non-commercial private or public institution, or a trust (other than Italian undertakings for collective
investment) not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial activities, the Italian State and public and
territorial entities; or

 - an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a tax withheld
at source (imposta sostitutiva), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal of
the Notes), unless the relevant Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an
authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the application of the risparmio gestito regime under Article 7
of Decree No. 461 (see also “—Tax treatment of capital gains—Discretionary investment portfolio regime
_(Risparmio Gestito Regime)” below)._

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes (being financial instruments issued by an Italian resident
corporation) may be exempt from any income taxation (including the 26% imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders
are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes
are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set
forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016 (“Law No. 232”), in Article 1,
paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018 (“Law No. 145”), in Article 13-bis of Law Decree
No. 124 of 26 October 2019 (“Law Decree No. 124”) and in Article 136 of Law Decree No. 34 of 19 May 2020
(“Decree No. 34/2020”), as amended and applicable from time to time.

Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity

In the event that the Italian-resident Noteholders mentioned above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to
which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be included in
the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation
and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due.

Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in
Italy of a non-Italian resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes, together with
the coupons related thereto, are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be
subject to the imposta sostitutiva. Interest must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax
return and is therefore subject to the general Italian corporate income taxation ( “IRES”, currently levied at the
rate of 24% and, if applicable, any relevant additional surcharge, such as the additional 3.5% surcharge for banks
and certain financial institutions) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder and
also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”, generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even
though regional surcharges may apply) (i.e., generally in the case of banks and financial institutions).

Effective as of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that was current on December 31, 2015, Article 1(550) of
Finance Act 2017 added paragraph 6-bis to Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, converted
into Law No. 214 of December 22, 2011. Under this new rule, the base upon which the “Aiuto alla Crescita
_Economica” benefit set forth in Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011 (ACE Benefit) is_
computed is reduced by an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the aggregate book value
of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari), including the Notes, other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial
statements for the relevant fiscal year and (ii) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari)
other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements of the fiscal year that was current on
December 31, 2010. Only Italian resident persons carrying on an entrepreneurial activity (and in particular Italian
resident corporations) and Italian permanent establishments of non-Italian resident persons can enjoy the ACE
Benefit. The new restrictive rule enacted by Finance Act 2017 applies only to taxpayers different from those

315


-----

carrying out financial and insurance activities falling into section K of the ATECO classification of economic
activities, other than non-financial holding companies.

Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and real estate
closed-ended investment companies (società di investimento a capitale fisso, or “SICAFs”), provided that the
Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Italian
authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediary)
Interest is subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate
investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain
circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale
of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment
funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of
any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis.

Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a non-real estate open-ended or a closed-ended collective investment fund
(“Fund”) or an open-ended investment company (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAVs”) or a
non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF or
(ii) their manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes, together with the coupons
related thereto, are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest accrued during the holding period on the
Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund,
the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF. The Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV are subject neither
to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at their level, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will be
levied, in certain circumstances, by the Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV on income realized by
unitholders or shareholders in the event of distribution, redemption or disposal of the units/shares.

Pension funds

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian
Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary,
Interest relating to the Notes, together with the coupons related thereto, and accrued during the holding period
will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the results of the relevant portfolio accrued
at the end of the tax period (which will be subject to a 20% substitute tax). Subject to certain conditions
(including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded
from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di
_risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232,_
in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124, and in Article 136 of
Decree No. 34/2020, as amended and applicable from time to time.

Application of the imposta sostitutiva

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, brokerage companies
(società di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio
(“SGR”), stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance or Italian
permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary; and

(b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of
the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act,
either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in
a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the
relevant Italian Intermediary paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients
that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to
which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes
due.

316


-----

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

If the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident for tax purposes, without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected, an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the
non-Italian resident Noteholder is:

(a) a beneficial owner of the payment of the Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a State or territory
included in the White List; or

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy; or

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a State or territory
included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own State of
establishment; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owner of the Interest
(or certain non-resident institutional investors) and must deposit the Notes together with any related coupons
since the issue date directly or indirectly with:

(i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or
financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the
deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as
defined below); or

(ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or
SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via
telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second
**Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy, acting through a system of**
centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the
Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as
Second Level Banks, provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident bank or
SIM, or the permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, or a central
depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24,
1998) for the purposes of the application of Decree No. 239. If a non-Italian resident Noteholder
deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level
Bank and a Second Level Bank. The exemption from the imposta sostitutiva for non-Italian resident
Noteholders is conditional upon:

i. the timely deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a
Second Level Bank; and

ii. the timely submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a
statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it
declares, inter alia, that it is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva.

Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12, 2001, is
valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need to
be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was
previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident
investors that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into
force in Italy referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official
reserves of a State referred to in point d) above. Additional requirements are provided for “institutional
investors” referred to in point c) above (in this respect see Circular No. 23/E of March 1, 2002 and No. 20/E of
March 27, 2003).

The imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at a rate of 26% to interest paid to Noteholders who do not qualify for
the foregoing exemption or do not timely and properly satisfy the requested conditions (including the procedures
set forth under Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules). Noteholders who are subject to the
_imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty, subject_
to timely filing of required documentation provided by Regulation of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency
No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013 or by any other forms approved by the respective tax authorities.

317


-----

_Fungibility Issues_

Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree no. 239, where the relevant issuer issues a new tranche forming
part of a single series with a previous tranche of notes, for the purposes of calculating the amount of Interest
subject to imposta sostitutiva, the issue price of the new tranche of notes will be deemed to be the same amount
as the issue price of the original tranche of notes. This rule applies where (a) the new tranche of notes is issued
within twelve months from the issue date of the previous tranche of notes and (b) the difference between the
issue price of the new tranche of notes and that of the original tranche of notes does not exceed 1% multiplied by
the number of years of the duration of the Notes.

_Payments Made by an Italian Resident Guarantor_

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Italian resident Noteholder by an Italian resident Guarantor of the
Notes, in accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal to Interest and
other proceeds from the Notes may be subject to the tax regime described above. However, there are no tax
authority guidelines directly regarding the Italian tax regime of payments on notes made by an Italian resident
Guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative
treatment of such payments or that the Italian courts would not support such an alternative treatment.

In particular, according to a different interpretation, if a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of Interest on
the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, pursuant to
Presidential Decree No. 600 of September 29, 1973 (currently at domestic rate of 26%), subject to such relief as
may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which
may apply.

**_Tax treatment of capital gains_**

_Italian-resident Noteholders_

Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity

Where an Italian-resident Noteholder is an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes
would be subject to a capital gain tax (imposta sostitutiva, or “CGT”) provided by Decree No. 461, levied at the
rate of 26%. Under certain conditions and limitations, Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their
capital gains.

In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, on capital gains, an Italian resident individual may opt–
under certain conditions–for any of the three regimes described below.

Tax return regime (Regime della dichiarazione)

Under the “tax return regime”, which is the default regime for Italian resident individuals not engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a
cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind) realized by the Italian
resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not
in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net
of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains
of the same kind, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital
losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four
succeeding tax years.

Non-discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Amministrato Regime)

As an alternative to the tax return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in
connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each
sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is
allowed subject to:

 - the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries (including
permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediaries); and

 - an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the
relevant Noteholder.

318


-----

The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the
Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred
capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder,
deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by
the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting
from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently
realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up to the
fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital
gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return.

Discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Gestito Regime)

In the Risparmio Gestito Regime, any capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not
in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets
(including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in
value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be
paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax
year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four
succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said
regime in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement)
and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26%
CGT) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security
entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10,
1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets
all the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph 100-114 of Law No. 232, in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of
Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124, and in Article 136 of Decree No. 34/2020, as amended
and applicable from time to time. Pursuant to Article 1, paragraphs 219-225 of Law no. 178 of 30 December
2020 (“Law No. 178”), it is further provided that Italian resident individuals investing, by 31 December 2021, in
long-term individual savings account compliant with Article 13-bis, paragraph 2-bis of Law Decree No. 124 may
benefit from a tax credit corresponding to possible capital losses, losses and negative differences realized in
respect of certain qualifying financial instruments comprised in the long-term individual savings account,
provided that certain conditions and requirements are met (e.g., including the loss of the possibility to
subsequently set off the relevant capital losses, losses and negative differences against future capital gains).

Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity

Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income
(and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the
production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the
Italian permanent establishment of non-Italian resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian
resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected.

Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian
real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment
fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of Interest—Real estate investment funds and real estate
_SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_
realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or disposal of the units or shares.

Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate
SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax
transparency basis.

Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a
SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of
the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the
SICAV, but income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or disposal of
the units/shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%.

Pension funds

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime
provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of
the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax. Subject to
certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes
may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraph
100-114 of Law No. 232, in Article 1, paragraph 211-215 of Law No. 145, in Article 13-bis of Law Decree
No. 124, and in Article 136 of Decree No. 34/2020, as amended and applicable from time to time.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes
by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively
connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders
from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets (which
term includes, for these purposes, also certain multilateral trading facilities) in Italy or abroad are not subject to
the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self- declaration that
the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected).

Pursuant to Article 5(5) of Decree No. 461, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the
sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated
markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), are not subject to the CGT,
provided that the beneficial owner is:

(a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a State or territory included in the White List and does not have a
permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; or

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy; or

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a State or territory
included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own State of
establishment and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate selfdeclaration of being an institutional investor; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth
above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree No. 239 (see “—Tax
_treatment of interest”)._

If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or
the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets (which term
includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of
26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing
that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the
recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident Noteholders without a permanent establishment in Italy to
which the Notes are effectively connected without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are
effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the
_risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_
capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized
financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the
competent tax authorities of their country of residence.

320


-----

The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident
persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the
right to waive this regime.

**_Certain reporting obligations for Italian-resident Noteholders_**

Under Law Decree No. 167 of June 28, 1990, converted into law by Law No. 227/1990, as subsequently
amended and supplemented, individuals, non-business entities and non-business partnerships that are resident in
Italy for tax purposes and, during the tax year, hold investments abroad or have financial assets abroad (including
possibly the Notes) must, in certain circumstances, disclose these investments or financial assets to the Italian tax
authorities in their annual income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that
must be filed within the same term as prescribed for the annual income tax return), regardless of the value of
such assets (save for deposits or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding €15,000 threshold
throughout the year, which per se do not require such disclosure). The requirement applies also where the persons
above, being not the direct holder of the financial assets, are the actual economic owners thereof for the purposes
of anti-money laundering legislation.

No disclosure requirements exist for investments and financial assets (including the Notes) under management or
administration entrusted to Italian resident intermediaries (Italian banks, SIMs, fiduciary companies or other
professional intermediaries, indicated in Article 1 of Decree No. 167 of June 28, 1990) and for contracts
concluded through their intervention, provided that the cash flows and the income derived from such activities
and contracts have been subjected to Italian withholding or substitute tax by the such intermediaries.

**_Italian inheritance tax and gift tax_**

Subject to certain exceptions, Italian inheritance and gift tax is generally payable on transfers of assets and rights
(including the Notes) (i) by reason of death or gift by Italian resident persons (or other transfers for no
consideration and the creation of liens on such assets for a specific purpose), even if the transferred assets are
held outside Italy, and (ii) by reason of death or gift by non-Italian resident persons, but limited to transferred
assets held in Italy. Notes issued by Italian resident company are deemed to be held in Italy.

Subject to certain exceptions, transfers of assets and rights (including the Notes) by reason of gift, donation or
succession proceedings are generally subject to Italian gift and inheritance tax as follows:

(a) at a rate of 4% for transfers in favor of the spouse or relatives in direct line, on the portion of the global
net value of the transferred assets, exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €1.0 million;

(b) At the rate of 6% for transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives in-law up to the
third degree on the entire value of the transferred assets (in case of transfers in favor to brothers or
sisters, the 6% rate is applicable only on the portion of the global net value of the transferred assets
exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €0.1 million); ; and

(c) At a rate of 8% for transfers in favor of any other person or entity, on the entire value of the inheritance
or the gift.

If the heir/heiress or the donee is a person with a severe disability pursuant to Law No. 104 of February 5, 1992,
inheritance tax or gift tax is applied to the extent that the value of the inheritance or gift exceeds €1.5 million at
the rate illustrated above, depending on the type of relationship existing between the deceased or donor and the
beneficiary.

With respect to Notes listed on regulated markets (including multilateral trading facilities), the relevant value for
inheritance and gift tax purposes is the average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the
succession or of the gift (including any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance
tax and gift tax purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar
features or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

The mortis causa transfer of financial instruments included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di
_risparmio a lungo termine), that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law is exempt from inheritance_
taxes.

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for Notes issued by Italian resident
companies.

**_Wealth tax on financial products held abroad—direct holding_**

According to Article 19(18) of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, recently amended by Article 1,
paragraphs 710 of Law No. 160 of December 27, 2019, Italian resident individuals, Italian non-commercial
entities, Italian non-commercial partnerships and similar Italian resident entities holding certain financial
products, including the Notes, outside Italy without the involvement of an Italian financial intermediary are in
certain cases required to pay a wealth tax currently at the rate of 0.2% (the tax being determined in proportion to
the period of ownership). The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year (or at the end
of the holding period) or, in the lack thereof, on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products
held outside Italy or on the purchase value of any financial product (including the Notes) held abroad by Italian
resident individuals. Taxpayers are generally permitted to deduct from the wealth tax a tax credit equal to any
wealth taxes paid in the State where the financial products are held (up to the amount of the Italian wealth tax
due).

The wealth tax cannot exceed €14,000 per year for Noteholders other than individuals.

The wealth tax is due only in relation to financial assets held outside the Italian territory (and not through an
Italian intermediary). If the Notes are held through Italian intermediaries, the rules described in subsection
“Stamp taxes and duties—holding through financial intermediary” apply.

**_Stamp taxes and duties—holding through financial intermediary_**

Under Article 13(2bis-2ter) of Decree No. 642 of October 26, 1972, as amended from time to time, a 0.2 %
stamp duty generally applies on communications and reports that Italian financial intermediaries periodically
send to their clients in relation to the financial products that are deposited with such intermediaries. The Notes
are included in the definition of financial products for these purposes. Communications and reports are deemed
to be sent at least once a year even if the Italian financial intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or
send such communications and reports.

The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000.00 per year for Noteholders other than individuals. The taxable base of
the stamp duty is the market value or—in the lack thereof—the nominal value or the redemption amount of any
financial product or in the case that the nominal value or redemption values cannot be determined, on the
purchase value of any financial asset (including the Notes) resulting from any periodic reporting communication
issued by the Italian financial intermediary with which the Notes are deposited (the tax being determined in
proportion to the reporting period).

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy and
Finance on May 24, 2012, the 0.2% stamp duty does not apply to communications and reports that the Italian
financial intermediaries send to investors who do not qualify as “clients” as defined in the regulations issued by
the Bank of Italy. Communications and reports sent to this type of investors are subject to the ordinary €2.00
stamp duty for each copy. Therefore, stamp duty applies both to Italian resident Noteholders and to non-Italian
resident Noteholders, to the extent that the Notes are held with, or administered or managed through, an Italianbased financial intermediary.

**_Registration tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of the Notes are subject to the registration tax as follows:

(i) public deeds and private deeds with notarized signatures (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate)
are subject to fixed registration tax at a rate of €200.00; and

(ii) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax of €200.00 only in
the case of use or voluntary registration or occurrence of the so-called enunciazione.

_OECD Common Reporting Standards and EU DAC 6 reporting obligations_

The EU Savings Directive adopted on June 3, 2003, by the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers (as
subsequently amended) on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments has been repealed from
January 1, 2016 to prevent overlap between the Savings Directive and the new automatic exchange of
information regime implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the
field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU).

322


-----

Drawing extensively on the intergovernmental approach to implementing the United States Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, the OECD developed the Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) to address the issue of offshore
tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the
CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of financial account information.
Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and
automatically exchange with exchange partners on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all
reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting
procedures. The first information exchanges are expected to begin in 2017.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS and the amended
EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation, which provides for the exchange of information in relation to the
calendar year 2016 and later. Law 95/2015 has been implemented by the Italian Ministerial Decree dated
December 28, 2015 which has been recently amended by the Italian Ministerial Decree dated 20 June 2019 and
published in the Official Gazette on 9 July 2019.

In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as meant in the
Italian Ministerial Decree dated June 20, 2019), they may be required to provide additional information to such
financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian implementation of the CRS.

As a consequence of the OECD project on “Base erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS), the EU DAC 6 Directive
(“DAC 6”) has been adopted on May 25, 2018 by the EU Council, amending Council Directive 2011/16/EU as
regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable crossborder arrangements. According to DAC 6, intermediaries and, in some circumstances, taxpayers are required to
notify the competent tax authorities of each Member States any cross-border arrangements that have at least one
of the so-called “hallmarks” designed by the EU legislator as “markers” of potential risk of international tax
evasion or avoidance or circumvention of disclosure requirements on financial accounts (CRS).

On August 26, 2020, the Legislative Decree No. 100, July 30, 2020 (the “DAC 6 Decree”), implementing the
said Directive, with disclosure obligations for intermediaries and taxpayers, was published. Italian Ministry of
Finance issued a Ministerial Decree on November 20, 2020, clarifying certain criteria set by the Italian law that
trigger the reporting obligations.

**Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This
discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of
FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any
U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local
or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be
sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that
any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the
impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to
special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement
accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or
other pass through entities or arrangements and investors therein, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a
permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States persons holding the Notes as part of a
“straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax
accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an
applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash
at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for
money to investors) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a
corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States,

323


-----

any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment
of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should
consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax
laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

**_Transactions related to the Acquisition_**

If the conditions for the Post-Completion Merger are met, it is expected that the Issuer will merge with the
MergerCo, with MergerCo being the surviving entity. MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Post-Completion Merger.” Although
the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so) that these
transactions will not constitute a significant modification of the Notes and therefore will not be treated as
resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the IRS could
take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Post-Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligations under
the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such a
position were taken and sustained, and the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the Post-Completion
Merger were less than the principal amount of the “new” Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount), such Notes could be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, U.S.
holders generally would recognize any gain in connection with such deemed exchange (although any loss could
be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
to them of the Acquisition and the Post-Completion Merger. The balance of the discussion below assumes that
the Post-Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligation under the Notes by MergerCo will not be
treated as a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Effect of the IPO Pushdown provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for “new”_
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders generally would recognize any gain on
such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the “new” Notes could be treated as issued with OID
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,”
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” and “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”), the Issuer
may be obligated to redeem the Notes for an amount less than their stated principal amount (plus accrued and
unpaid interest), or may be obligated to redeem the Notes or to make certain payments on the Notes in excess of
stated principal and interest. The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The
Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that
it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as
contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different
than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of this discussion
assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt
instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

324


-----

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will
be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment
(translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt)
will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest
income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such
euro denominated accrued interest generally will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot
rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the
average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may
elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last
day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot
rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within
five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described
in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.
The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed
without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such
interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the
U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is
received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued
during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be
treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to
interest income or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered
“passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal
income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to
such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of
foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (not
including any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income
as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such
Note to such U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is
treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or
an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the
settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such
euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is
considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual

325


-----

basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of
exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in
regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date
and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain
or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is
attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally
will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such
gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro
purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the
Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain
or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated
as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange
gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by
such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of euro exchange gain or loss attributable to such
disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year
are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder
unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply
with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax
and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in
respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). U.S. holders who are individuals and who own
“specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time
during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such
assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject
to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income
taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on
which such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain
circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules. U.S. holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their ownership of the
Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject to
the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax
on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S.
source payments. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments generally would
apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal
Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on
these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the
date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are
published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date.
Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the
Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the
expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments (including Italy) have entered into agreements
with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to
implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is
imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate
for the withheld amount.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Notes offered hereby are governed by New York law. However, the Issuer’s creation and issuance of the
Notes (i.e., its corporate resolutions) are governed by Italian law.

The Issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Italy. HoldCo and the Target are incorporated under the
laws of Italy. Following the Post-Completion Merger, MergerCo will also be an entity incorporated under the
laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral for the Notes will be governed by the laws of Italy and the
documents relating to the Escrow Charge will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. The Indenture and
the Notes are or will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and HoldCo and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer, HoldCo, or MergerCo or any such other non-U.S. resident
person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes
or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer will appoint an agent for service of
process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection
with any action in relation to the Notes, the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States
in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, or
other laws against us or on such other persons as mentioned above in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. It may
be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons, the Issuer
provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, HoldCo or, following the Post-Completion Merger,
MergerCo, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets.
Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the
countries in which the Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent
jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final, enforceable and conclusive judgments rendered by U.S. courts,
including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state
securities laws may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of
Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among
others, the following conditions are met:

    - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

    - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with
U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated;

    - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
the defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in
accordance with U.S. law;

    - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal (passato in giudicato) in accordance with
U.S. law;

    - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

    - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

    - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S.
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a

328


-----

proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of
Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set
out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the
U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court
may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought
(e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of
Italian law.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in Italy, the jurisdiction where the Issuer_
_and the Target are organized and certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and of_
_the security interests applicable to the Collateral. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy,_
_insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of_
_organization of a future guarantor or a future security provider of the Notes and it does not purport to be_
_complete or to discuss all the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Notes, the Guarantee or the security interests being provided for the Notes. The application of these various laws_
_in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely_
_affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the security interests_
_in the Collateral. Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations_
_and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Target are incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union (the “EU”).

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to
insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the
company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its
“center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have
differing and conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time
of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is
presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the
three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption
of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s
central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management
of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into
consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are
held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the
company’s operations.

If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU
member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency
proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the
Insolvency Regulation.

If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2)
of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
(subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company
only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any
insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect,
secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in
the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic
activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU
member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state.

330


-----

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which
the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can
only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated
under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a
creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request
the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori
_concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant
EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder
appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the
powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove
assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary
further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets.

The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the
commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to
facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation
with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of
companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency
Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the
Issuer.

**Italy**

**_Limitation on granting of security interests and on enforcement under Italian law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its
by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or guarantee is being provided in the context
of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be
triggered.

_Corporate benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive
a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such
company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and
determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of
the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for
downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and
effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure or
guarantee (as applicable) financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant

331


-----

security provider/grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real
and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it
can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or
security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations
of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of
distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as
to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of
interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be
disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a
security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a
conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor
if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within
the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate
benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising
control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control.
Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be
declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and
such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees
or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and
authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among
others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree
No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the
issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is
part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling
and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies
which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant
guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees
would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

_Financial assistance_

_In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which_
_would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of_
_the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give_
_financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or_
_subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly)_
_controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the_
_purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also_
_be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of_
_these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best_
_interests of the company._

_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum
amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by
reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted
by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount
must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor.
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such

332


-----

determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the
guarantee could be declared void.

_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each, an “Italian Guarantor”) may
be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject
to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

In the event that the Post-Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, as regards to the
Target, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests (if any) granted by the Target will only guarantee and secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not
exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including
the Funding Loan) (or other financial support in any form, not including equity contributions) advanced
from time to time to the Target (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the
Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing
Date, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the
Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any
security interests (if any) granted by the Target; provided that the Target shall be fully entitled to exercise
any rights of set-off, recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) or other similar rights it may
have by reason of any payment made by it under its Guarantee in respect of any obligations owed by the
Issuer, against the payment obligations of the Target under any relevant intercompany loans and/or
documentary credits and/or any other financial support received by the Target, provided that the liability of
the Target under its Guarantee shall not exceed the aggregate amount of any such intercompany loans and/or
documentary credits and/or any other financial support following the exercise of any such set-off rights;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by the Target, also in accordance with article 1938 of the
Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in
“Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment,
prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate
amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes
to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target will be at
any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the
principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the Target at that time;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of the Target under its
Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the
Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set
forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively; and

(v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest (if any) by the Target does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not)
extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or
payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’
proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the Target and, therefore, does not fall within

333


-----

the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian
Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to
clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’
proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of the Target.
Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests (if any) granted by the Target be deemed by a court or public
authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as
applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests (if any) could be declared null and
void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of
any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian
Civil Code, applicable to the Target, the Target will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee
shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor
and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional
limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security
documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above
corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to
pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably
concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security
provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari
passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice
versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and
the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/
or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents
related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the
transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of
any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate
basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

_The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the_
_guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with_
_the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover_
_limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security._

_Trust_

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code.
Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and
guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and
on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to
the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the
rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither
directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the
Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is
not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at
the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the
_rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders_
of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of
the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of

334


-----

the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different
view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the
holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that
Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante
_comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_
appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of
such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates
and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept
of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and
powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain considerations in relation to guarantees and security interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior
to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should
any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes
is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian
subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized
above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity
subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a
company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the period
between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable
_subordination” rule._

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees security
interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the
appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback
of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions
made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”).

For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency
scenario, see “—Certain Italian insolvency law considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee
or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent
estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose
the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related
security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have
a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may
be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

 - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

 - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

 - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party
can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own
obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil
Code;

 - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law
concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or
become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

 - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible
assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

 - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its
opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on
reasonable grounds;

 - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited
by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the
fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles
and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian
law;

 - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to
all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment
might not be held to do so;

336


-----

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not
binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other
provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the
parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or
instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code
are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations
of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined
by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under
the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue
individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic
stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee
is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/
attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to
interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the
forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa);
the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an
indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is
witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian
law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory
provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company,
which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any
obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the
Italian Usury Law; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does
not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued
and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the
event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed
after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties
to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a
consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

337


-----

 - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing
enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

 - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge
could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a
consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would
be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/
shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a
declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act
that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

 - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or,
if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for
the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

 - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act
was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent
design.

**_Certain Italian insolvency law considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be
more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are
expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative
Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19,
2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency
matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which substantially reforms the Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as
subsequently amended and supplemented and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and enacts a
new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of
Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in
the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by
the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation
and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale);
(ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain
such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same
Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the
pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings;
(vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over
proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at
ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on
March 16, 2019, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been
postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (the “Liquidity Decree”), as
converted by Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020, and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named
_Parte Prima-Titolo II (i.e., the new preventive alert and mediation phase), which will entry into force on_

338


-----

December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree
**118/2021”), published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 202 of August 24, 2021.**

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be converted in law within 60 days from its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale,
otherwise it will cease to be effective; in the context of the conversion process changes and amendments – which
cannot be foreseen – may be included and impact the above new provisions.

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it
stands now.

The main innovations of the Law Decree 118/2021 are the following:

(i) additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code;

(ii) introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a
simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato
semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio);

(iii) amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code.

The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in
the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical consequences of_
the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two
following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree
118/2021 requesting the court to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if
necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and
**_(ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to_**
authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore
_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_
assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow,
notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to
corporate groups.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the
filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”).

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties
involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings
close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with
fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried
out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of
commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not
agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed
situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations
require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the
entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

339


-----

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert
issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the
court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any).

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or
with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective
Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors
cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo,
payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of
conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot
be declared bankrupt nor insolvent.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must
simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures
and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will
be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the
court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the
Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240
days.

Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written
notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the
negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives
of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives
immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with in the companies’ register.
When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which
may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree
118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent
that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’
financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under
Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as
follow:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for
application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to
the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at
least 2 years;

340


-----

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects
provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law without the need for an
independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided thereby.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt
restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article
182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

(a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to
Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

(c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called
_Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure._

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in
the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione
_dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato_
_preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta_
_amministrativa),_ extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione
_straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of
security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the
development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place
at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its
appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its
authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

(iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be
consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of
the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree
118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition
with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome, and that the options
provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days
following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under_
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The petition for concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day_
following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111,
167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply.

The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_
regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with
preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a

prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the
entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been
implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the
reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to
Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 (the date of
its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6,
2015, entered into force August 21, 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale); and (ii) the
amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted
into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill
of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue
procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses
and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary
status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing
financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to
enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but
which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_
law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate certain
provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections.

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases
where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court
arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the_
_Italian Bankruptcy Law_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial
condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring
plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval
to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet
the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt
restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all
outstanding claims.

-----

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the
debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition
with creditors and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any
protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/ or
acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to
certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed
(although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain
tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court
pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi_
di ristrutturazione dei debiti)

The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount
of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by
the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare
and that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied
within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione),
in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the
relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at
the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is
insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication.
Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any
conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and
cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement.

The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a
third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, writeoffs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned
publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be
published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having
verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of
the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the
creditors. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement.
At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the
moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or
continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline
(not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be
deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the
moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication
of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate
the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of
May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial
amendments are made to the plan.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to
the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article
182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for
admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and
does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies,
thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt
restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging
to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can
request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called
“cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors are not treated
worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a
non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business
activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified
of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring
agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of
non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however,
non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it.

The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final
Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set
forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt
restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is
valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going
concern.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class
would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the
requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the
truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of
the crisis and (iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent
with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the
creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations and have
been kept informed). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30
days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new
obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing
facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021,
Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally
liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless
agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable
with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will
remain liable as guarantors.

-----

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the
approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders,
but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a
petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may
be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such
priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or approval (omologazione) of
the agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by
shareholders up to 80% of their amount.

Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in
relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the
debtor, if so expressly requested to: (i) incur in new super senior indebtedness subject to authorization by the
court; (ii) secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that
the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the approval
(omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the
creditors; and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already
payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the
company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may
be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to Article 182 quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the
approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing;
(ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail
an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

_Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such
composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds:
(i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of
the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor
company can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a
restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_
date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the
creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed.
During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title
arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the
court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment
of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least

345


-----

20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law),
including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or
affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and
debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition
for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law. The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the
latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within
a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of
a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182- bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts
such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of
nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further
verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and
information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the
stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo
also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court, pending the concordato in bianco, as well as the approval (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing
of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in
absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at
supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, are treated as super-senior (so called
_prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security_
interests granted are exempted from the claw- back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted
with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di
_pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the_
proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company
being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the
preliminary petition.

346


-----

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the
debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these
cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as
a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of
the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition
proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide
for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge.
The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization,
while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato preventivo is approved
only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not
exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of
the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have not exercise their voting right will
be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in
the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect
to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has
however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest—as could be the case
of disenfranchised noteholders—to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote,
albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo
unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive
full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court
may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected
to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting
creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the
implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different
classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless
sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a
greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular,
that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_
or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based
on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
agreement court-supervised composition with creditors aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and
having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors
are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on
the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

347


-----

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and approved (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by
Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the
debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may
request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of
the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by
the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public
prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be
authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_
application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after
admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a
period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to
receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such
indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

_Impacts of the Covid-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter alia, on
insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the
continuity of companies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that
were trading on a going concern basis before the Covid-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of
certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the Covid-19 pandemic or already approved by the
beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree.

Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for
fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a_
_concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei_
_debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an_
extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in
accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court
assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a
_concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities_
were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency
scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type)
of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen
in the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure,
originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266,
of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the
Covid-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing
between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or
(ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor
when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by
the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_
had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

 - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within
a defined period;

 - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors
may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore
_fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the_
relevant timing in his or her decision;

 - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare);

 - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the
company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors;

 - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain
cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made
through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

 - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration
are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of
the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge
(giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors,
and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from
the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect,
Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements
applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is
shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including
employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under
mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as
those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian
bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are
satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below
indicated.

    - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can
terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant
petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration
of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one

349


-----

year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness
to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of
_concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato_
_fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in
respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of
creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of
debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured
claims are paid only in part, provided that they do not receive less than the fair market value of their
secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert). The concordato fallimentare
proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by
value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the
classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

    - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be
allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of
claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured
creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are
paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally
acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and
social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are,
in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in
most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges
(creditori pignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the
proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority.
Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities
of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The
law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from
the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, article 111 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the
following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency
proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged,
such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims.

    - Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to
the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key
avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and
transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally
considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in
other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the
context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to
three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or
transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request
of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

    - Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to
certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency
declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration
(trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the
transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the
delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of

350


-----

receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective
vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency
declaration.

    - Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner.

a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back
(revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be
declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of
the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the
debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration
received by and/or promised to the debtor;

ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary
means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in
order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new
security was granted.

b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified
below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent
party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or
made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

ii. granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration.

c. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as
the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a
non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided
that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the
investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan
(piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato
_preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del_
_debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out
by them; and

vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services
necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity
be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for
by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions
whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective

351


-----

with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction
was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently
entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a
transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and,
if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provides for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with
respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from
the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous
transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In
case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party
purchaser. Finally, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national
rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese_
in stato di insolvenza).

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must
be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in
the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of
its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during
its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the
public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and
creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to
those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial
phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then
issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate
whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver
submit(s) a report to the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of
Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the company to the
extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the judicial
receiver’s report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the
extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim
management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide
either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years
(unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors
(concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary
commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan;
however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt.

_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_
insolvenza)

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative
phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those

352


-----

from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a
Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery
Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public
interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial
institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these
companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special
insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario
_liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_
(comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other
insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of
the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and
includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with
respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.

_Interim financing_

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_
expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the
relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such
finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of
the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the
principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year
(six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that
certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period
of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or
by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the
debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to

353


-----

(i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency
at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the
value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in
kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into
after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of
the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior
to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent
creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into,
and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously
to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the
insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The
transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the
granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a Guarantor and/or security provider. If they are
challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the
relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the
insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions,
all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis –à-vis creditors if
entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or
thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to
insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace
the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European
Union.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement dated October 7, 2021 (the “Purchase
**Agreement”), by and among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell to each Initial**
Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, together with all
other Initial Purchasers, €375.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our
counsel. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof
through and including the date that is 90 days after the date the Notes are issued, to not, without having received
prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of
any securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that are substantially similar to the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. and may not be offered or sold
within the United States except to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (and, if investors are
resident in a member state of the EEA or in the UK, they are not “retail investors” (as defined below). Resales of
the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.” Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to
have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” The
Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (1) outside the United States in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S and (2) in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of such Notes
within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering of the Notes may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer intends to effect any sales of the
Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealer affiliates as permitted
by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the
right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or
otherwise make available any Notes to any “retail investor” in the European Economic Area or the United
Kingdom. The expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

    - a retail client (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) and, with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”));

    - a customer, with respect to the European Economic Area, within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU,
as amended (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II and, with respect to the United
Kingdom, within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or

    - not a “qualified” investor (with respect to the European Economic Area, as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”) and with respect to the United Kingdom, as defined in the
EU Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA).

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

355

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will make an
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for
trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. However, we cannot assure you that the
Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell
any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

In connection with the Offering of the Notes, UniCredit Bank AG (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or persons
acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open
markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also
over allot the Offering of the Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in
the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on
its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of,
or trading markets for, the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through their
selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered with the
SEC.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has also agreed that (a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated
and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and (b) it has complied
and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to any
Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States or Italy, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Group or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for the
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this
Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to
purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resales of the Notes. Please see the sections entitled “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer has agreed to indemnify
each Initial Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute
to payments that any Initial Purchaser may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer will pay the Initial
Purchasers a commission and pay certain fees and expenses relating to the offering of the Notes.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date as
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the tenth business day following the
date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+10). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the
U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless
the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the
Notes initially will settle in T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_The following restrictions will apply to the Notes. You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any_
_offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers
(as defined in Rule 144A, “QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) outside the United States in an offshore
transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the Securities Act and, therefore, the Notes may not
be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to the
Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

    - in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms
used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A and (ii) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in any transaction not subject thereto,
and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is either (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A,
and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB, or (b) it is purchasing
the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Target, the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any
of the foregoing, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any Notes, other
than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It
has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask
questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the
Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum;

(4) it is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not
with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes to a QIB pursuant to Rule 144A or in offshore transactions
pursuant to Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act;

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing
the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, that
if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Notes or any beneficial interests in any
Notes, it will not do so prior to the date which is, in the case of Notes offered to QIBs, one year after the
later of the original issue date of such Notes, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional

358


-----

securities and the last date on which the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer was the owner of such Note (or
any predecessor of such Note) only (a) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration
statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as such Note is
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its
own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance
on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions
in compliance with Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the
Issuer’s right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (d) or (e) to require the delivery of
an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to it, including a certificate of
transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of such Security.

(6) it understands that the 144A Notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR
UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER OF
THIS NOTE (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS
DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) (“QIB”); (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN
BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED NOTES TO
OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THIS
SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL
ISSUE DATE OF SUCH NOTES, THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE OF THE ISSUANCE OF ANY
ADDITIONAL NOTES AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF
THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF SUCH NOTE (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF SUCH SECURITY)
ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THIS NOTE IS ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO
RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A
“QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND
SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN OFFSHORE TRANSACTIONS IN
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO ANY
OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO COMPLIANCE WITH ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS, AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS
PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (E) TO REQUIRE
THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER
INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO IT, INCLUDING A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE
FORM APPEARING ON THE REVERSE OF THIS SECURITY; AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL
TRANSFER TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE
SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of
beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes:

(1) it agrees that it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to whom it transfers the
Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes, if then applicable;

(2) it acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes
acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that the restrictions
set forth therein have been complied with;

359


-----

(3) it acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase
of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any
Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such investor account;
and

(4) it understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or the
Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be
subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Notice to U.S. Investors,” “Notice to Investors” and “Plan
_of Distribution.”_

(5) It agrees to indemnify and hold us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
harmless from and against any cost, damage or loss incurred by any of them as a result of any of the
foregoing representations and agreements being or becoming false.

(6) It acknowledges that any purported acquisition or transfer of the Notes or beneficial interest therein to an
acquirer or transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be null and
void ab initio.

**Notes to the condensed interim financial information as at and for the three months ended 30 June 2021**

**1.** **Business**

EOLO S.p.A. (“EOLO” or the “company”) is a national telecommunications operator and market leader in the
supply of ultra-broadband FWA (fixed wireless access) services to the residential, business and wholesale
sectors.

Set up in 1999 in Varese as NGI, the company’s core business is the supply of wireless connectivity services. In
2007, it developed a wireless broadband internet access service marketed under the “EOLO” brand (which then
became the company’s name in 2016).

At the forefront of the search for innovative technological solutions to eliminate the digital divide, EOLO’s
mission is to guarantee the right to connectivity focusing on the individual in order to improve their quality of
life and create value for businesses.

At 30 June 2021, EOLO has 513 employees based in its headquarters in Busto Arsizio (Varese), located in a
20,000 square metre campus with offices, research labs, a logistics hub, conference centre, internal canteen and
recreational areas, and its operating offices in Rome and Padua.

EOLO provides its services using its proprietary TLC infrastructure comprising fibre optic and radio
transmission nodes located throughout Italy. Its network is developed in northern and central Italy while a
massive investment plan was rolled out in 2019 to expand intensively into southern Italy.

The company complied with the guidelines provided by the government and competent authorities in order to
deal with Covid-19 epidemiological emergency.

In order to guarantee its ability to ensure business continuity, the company kept its employees and consultants up
to date with any new information and urged its employees to work from home when possible while concurrently
safeguarding those employees who continued to come into work as it was impossible for them to work remotely.

Except as indicated above, no other significant impact on operations due to Covid-19 occurred

EOLO has provided all its employees at the head office and those engaged in network maintenance work around
the country with personal protective equipment (PPE).

It also continued to revisit its safety measures and to update its Covid-19 protocol (“Common protocol of
measures to contain and curb the diffusion of Covid-19 in work environments”) about the office capacity, body
temperature scanning, shifts, sanitisation of common areas and canteen management.

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**_Financial information_**

The interim financial information is based on the accounting records at 30 June 2021 and has been prepared on a
going concern basis. It is accompanied by these notes and comprise:

    - statement of financial position: assets and liabilities are presented as current or non-current and the
amounts to be settled or recovered within or after 12 months of the reporting date are described in the
notes to each asset and liability;

    - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income: costs are classified by nature and the
operating profit or loss and pre-tax profit or loss are presented as separate sub-totals;

    - statement of changes in equity: this statement shows the company’s comprehensive income (expense),
owner transactions and details of each equity item presented;

    - statement of cash flows: this presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Cash flows from operating activities are presented using the indirect method, under which the profit or

_Condensed interim financial information_
_at 30 June 2021_

loss for the period is adjusted for non-monetary transactions, the postponement or accrual of previous
or future collections or payments and revenue related to cash flows from investing or financing
activities.

This interim financial information as at and for the three months ended 30 June 2021 has been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 – Interim financial reporting, endorsed by European Union, and does not contain all the
information and notes required for annual financial statements. It should, therefore, be read together with the
financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2021. However, although this interim financial
information does not contain all the disclosures of a complete set of financial statements, it does include all an
explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the financial
position and performance since the end of the last annual reporting period.

The statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the
statement of cash flows are prepared in Euros (the company’s functional currency) without decimal points. The
figures in the statement of changes in equity and these notes are prepared in thousands of Euros, unless specified
otherwise.

The required captions with nil balances for both the current and comparative periods have not been included in
the financial information.

**_Approval of the financial information_**

The company’s board of directors approved the interim financial information as at and for the three months
ended 30 June 2021 at the meeting held on 16 September 2021 and KPMG S.p.A. has reviewed them.

**_Use of judgements and estimates_**

In preparing these interim financial information and notes, management has had to make judgements and
estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and
liabilities at the reporting date. These judgements and estimates are based on information available at the date of
preparation of the financialinformation, management’s experience and other relevant information. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. Estimates are used to measure assets, amortisation and depreciation, assess the
recoverability deferred tax assets, recognise loss allowances and measure employee benefits and contingent
liabilities using actuarial techniques. Management revisits the estimates and judgements regularly and the effects
of any changes are shown in profit or loss.

Critical measurement processes and key judgements used to apply the IFRS and the main sources of uncertainty
in estimates have not changed since those described in the financial statements as at and for the year ended
31 March 2021.

Management checks the estimates and judgements regularly. They are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations about future events that could have an impact on the company’s financial position and are
considered reasonable in the circumstances.

**_Fair value_**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous
market to which the company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance
risk.

A number of the company’s accounting policies and disclosure obligations require the measurement of fair
values for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When one is available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

_Condensed interim financial information_
_at 30 June 2021_

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use
of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the company measures assets
and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction
price - i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the company determines that the fair value on
initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an
active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable
inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially
measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the
transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life
of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the
transaction is closed out.

**3.** **Accounting policies**

This interim financial information has been prepared using the same accounting policies as those applied by the
company in the most recent annual financial statements and there are no standards that the company has not yet
applied or adopted early that could affect it significantly.

During the three months ended 30 June 2021 the company acquired assets with a cost of € 5,222 thousand,
including internal work capitalised for € 309 thousand (three months ended 30 June 2020 cost of
€ 2,455 thousand, including internal work capitalised for € 388 thousand).

“Software and licences” of €15,958 thousand comprise the cost of preliminary analyses and the study, design and
development of new technical ICT solutions, such as evolutions of the geointelligence system, automation of the
marketing and customer journey processes and upgrading of integrations to the big data system. The increase for
the period is mainly related to capital expenditures related to exclusive use of end-to-end fibre optic connections.

The costs of the internal development of unprotected application software are recognised under intangible assets
under development until the related project has been completed, after which they are reclassified to the
appropriate intangible asset caption. At 30 June 2021, the residual amount of these capitalised costs is
€2,004 thousand (€1,938 thousand at 31 March 2021).

“Frequencies” amount to €3,291 thousand and mostly comprise the costs incurred to purchase the rights to use
radio frequencies. They are amortised over the term of the related right.

“Assets under development and payments on account” of €394 thousand mostly relate to uncompleted activities
to develop applications.

“Other” of €1,397 thousand mainly consists of costs incurred to purchase IP addresses.

The company has not revalued or impaired intangible assets at 30 June 2021 or at previous year ends.

The statement of cash flows shows the increases in intangible assets during the period.

“Sundry deferred costs” mainly consist of costs relating to subsequent periods for device maintenance (€1,770
thousand), software maintenance and licences (€1,749 thousand), sundry service activation contributions (€561
thousand) and connectivity (€516 thousand).

“Deferred costs for virtual vouchers” relate to virtual vouchers recognised in profit or loss when they are used by

arising from the company’s tax losses, which were transferred to the parent Cometa S.p.A. and may be used
solely by it due to the expiry of the domestic tax consolidation scheme provided for by article 117 and following
articles of Presidential decree no. 917/1986 on 31 March 2019.

This amount was reclassified as a tax asset after the transfer (as allowed by article 43-ter of Presidential decree
no. 602/73) of part of the excess IRES tax losses recognised by the parent due to its higher payments made.

**19. Employee benefits**

**_a) Non-current_**

The non-current liability for employee benefits comprises post-employment benefits, amounting to
€4,773 thousand at the reporting date, which is a net increase of €190 thousand on 31 March 2021 being the
balance of utilisations and accruals.

These liabilities may be analysed as follows:

_€’000_ **30/06/2021** **31/03/2021** **Variation**

**Closing balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,773** **19,450** **(14,677)**

The decrease in the non-current liability for employee benefits on 31 March 2021 is due to the long-term
incentive plan (LTIP), which was reclassified to current liabilities at 30 June 2021 since EOLO’s ownership is
expected to change in the short term, and this will trigger the pay-outs. Reference should be made to note 19.b for
additional details.

Changes in the post-employment benefits during the period are shown below:

**Closing balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,773** **4,583**

The main actuarial assumptions are set out in the following table (shown as weighted averages):

**30/06/2021** **31/03/2021**

Annual discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.79% 0.72%

Annual real salary growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.50% 0.50%

Should any reasonably possible changes in the actuarial assumptions have taken place at the reporting date, they
would not have had a significant impact on the benefits’ carrying amounts.

**Closing balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **20,362** **5,221** **15,141**

The company introduced a five-year LTIP on 1 September 2018 for its directors and/or managers and/or key
employees.

The liability for this LTIP amounts to €16,306 thousand (including the relevant portion of the related costs), up
€1,439 thousand on 31 March 2021. At 31 March 2021, it was classified under non-current liabilities and was
reclassified at 30 June 2021 under current liabilities for employee benefits since EOLO’s ownership is expected
to change in the short term, and this will trigger payment of the payments.

Under this plan, beneficiaries are awarded a bonus (€2,670 thousand at 30 June 2021) which is included in their
remuneration. This bonus is calculated using a multiplier mechanism based on the increase in the company’s
value compared to a benchmark defined in the plan regulation. In addition, the plan has various payment options
(including partial options) including should the company’s shares be sold (cash-settled), the company be listed
(equity-settled) or upon the benefits’ natural maturity date (cash-settled).

The company engaged an external expert to estimate the plan’s fair value. This expert applied the relevant
valuation criteria and calculated the plan’s fair value to be the present value (at each reference date) of the
remuneration streams to be paid to the beneficiaries using the binomial model. The expert also considered an
estimate of the company’s enterprise value at the reporting date compared to the benchmark defined in the plan
regulation.

The estimate of the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2021 and 30 June 2021 considered the directors’ assessment of
the expected change in ownership in the short term as well as, given the reference context, an enterprise value at
the reporting date calculated using a market comparables approach, and the status of the negotiations. As a result,
the estimated vesting periods were revised.

The estimated fair value at 30 June 2021 is equal to €17.355 million, unchanged compared to 31 March 2021.

Sensitivity analyses show that the plan’s fair value is sensitive to changes in the estimate of the company’s
enterprise value at the reference dates.

**20. Other liabilities**

**_a) Non-current_**

The caption mostly comprises the non-current portion of deferred income for the tax asset on investments in
Southern Italy (€387 thousand and €429 thousand at 30 June 2021 and 31 March 2021, respectively) and the

Trade payables of €56,994 thousand are net of trade discounts and include invoices to be received of
€12,691 thousand. They are mostly due to connectivity service and equipment providers and are concentrated
with just a few key suppliers.

Credit notes to be received show the amounts charged and deemed not due which the company has accordingly
contested with the counterparty, as well as price adjustments granted by the providers of connectivity and related
services.

**22. Contract liabilities**

This caption refers to connectivity services invoiced and paid for in advance but not yet provided.

Revenue refers to the rendering of connectivity services. More information about the company’s products is
available in the table below.

All revenue is earned with Italian customers in Euros.

Other income mostly consists of deferred income for grants obtained for infrastructure investments covered by
the Ministry of Economic Development’s calls for proposals (€204 thousand and €596 thousand at 30 June 2021
and 30 June 2020, respectively) and tax assets for investments in Southern Italy (€42 thousand at 30 June 2021).

The decrease in other income for grants obtained for infrastructure investments covered by the Ministry of
Economic Development’s calls for proposals reflects the infrastructural investments whose depreciation period
endedon 31 March 2021.

**_Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers_**

No debt or equity instruments of EOLO are traded in a public market, nor is EOLO in the process of filing its
financial information with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any
class of instruments in a public market, consequently IFRS 8 on segment reporting is not applicable.

higher revenue. It mostly refers to the cost of Installations & Maintenance and Marketing & Sales, which include
the cost of commissions paid to agents and representatives.

The increase in marketing costs in particular is due to the new advertising campaign launched during the period.

Costs to obtain and fulfil contracts amount to €3,978 thousand and €3,038 thousand for the reporting period and
the same period of the previous year, respectively.

The company uses the following methods and main assumptions to determine the fair value of financial
instruments:

   - non-derivative financial assets: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows discounted at
the reporting-date market interest rate. Their fair value is the same as their carrying amount as it is
already net of impairment losses;

   - loans and bank loans and borrowings: they bear floating interest rates and, therefore, there are no
significant differences between their carrying amount and fair value, also because they are presented
net of the related cost;

   - trade payables and other liabilities: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows
discounted at the reporting-date market interest rate. Their carrying amount is a reasonable
approximation of their fair value;

   - derivative financial liabilities: their fair value equals the present value of the expected cash flows
estimated using observable market parameters, compared to the prices of the counterparty financial
intermediary.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Condensed interim financial information_
_at 30 June 2021_

**_Fair value hierarchy_**

There are three levels:

   - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an
entity can access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most
reliable evidence of fair value and if there is no principal market, the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability shall be identified;

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2
input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Instruments included in
Level 2 are assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals;

   - Level 3: inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to
measure fair value to the extent that Level 1 and 2 inputs are not available.

Derivative financial liabilities are recognised at Level 2 fair value. The carrying amount of the company’s other
financial assets and liabilities, calculated as described above, is a reasonably approximation of their fair value.

**_Financial risk management_**

The company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

   - market risk: interest rate risk and currency risk;

   - liquidity risk;

   - credit risk.

The company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for its risk appetite and risk appetite framework.

The company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by it, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the company’s activities. The
company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The risk of adverse changes in interest rates on the currency markets mostly relates to the non-current credit
facilities agreed on 17 December 2019.

The related agreement establishes an interest rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR for the drawn-down amounts.

Given the type of credit facilities and market trends, the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into
hedges to mitigate or eliminate this risk.

It is not obliged to do so under the terms of the loan agreements.

Had the interest rates been 1% higher at the reporting date, the company’s equity and profit for the period would
have been respectively lower or higher, net of the related tax, by approximately €281 thousand. Moreover, the
company has not considered potential extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be foreseen.

The company does not measure any financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) nor
does it designate derivatives as fair value hedges.

**_Currency risk_**

Trade receivables are not exposed to currency risk as the related transactions solely take place in Euros.

While the company undertakes transactions with suppliers in foreign currency, the amounts involved are
immaterial and, therefore, it is not significantly exposed to currency risk for its trade payables.

The company’s exposure to currency risk is as follows:

**30/06/2021** **31/03/2021**
_€’000_ **€** **USD** **€** **USD**

**Trade payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,369** **5,263** **4,141** **4,855**

The following significant exchange rates have been applied:

**Average annual rate** **Closing rate**
**Period ended** **Period ended**
**30/06/2021** **30/06/2020** **30/06/2021** **31/03/2021**

**USD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 1.2054 1.1686 1.1884 1.1725

Had the above currencies appreciated or depreciated by 10%, the company’s equity and profit for the period
would have increased/decreased by approximately €444 thousand, net of the related tax. This sensitivity analysis
assumes that all the other variables, specifically interest rates, would not change and it does not consider the
effect of planned sales and purchases.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Cash flows generated by operating activities are held in the company’s current accounts with major banks and
possibly invested in low-risk short-term instruments, whose yield is linked to changes in interest rates.

The treasury department closely monitors the company’s net financial position to manage and optimise its
commitments with suppliers and banks.

The company manages its liquidity effectively by using the most suitable sources of funding for its needs.

Interest to be paid on floating rate loans shown in the table is calculated using reporting-date market rates, which
may fluctuate. Future cash flows of contingent consideration and derivatives could differ from the amounts
presented above if the interest or exchange rates or the conditions of the underlying change.

Excluding these financial liabilities, the cash flows are not expected to take place before the expected date or for
significantly different amounts.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk related to non-business customers is minimal as payments are made in advance. With respect to
business customers, the company checks its trade receivables at each reporting date to identify any objective
evidence of impairment due to events that have taken place since their initial recognition. It considers whether
the customer has significant financial difficulties, demonstrated by its inability to make payments or the possible
commencement of court-approved creditors settlement procedures. The loss allowance always matches the trade
receivables’ expected lifetime losses.

All the trade receivables are due from Italian customers.

There are no significant concentrations with single customers.

_Impairment_

The company has a loss allowance to cover estimated losses on trade receivables and other assets, which it tests
for impairment individually (when the amounts involved are significant) or collectively (on groups of similar
assets for unidentified losses). Trade receivables are broken down by ageing bracket in the following table:

The loss allowance of €5,200 thousand at 30 June 2021 (€4,759 thousand at 31 March 2021) mostly refers to
trade receivables past due by more than 360 days, net of payments on account received from the same customers.

Changes in the loss allowance for trade receivables are shown below:

The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable based on the present value of the discounted
cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The company considers
reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes quantitative and qualitative
information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well as forward-looking
information.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**

The company regularly checks its exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and takes suitable
mitigation actions when necessary. Specifically, its policies provide that it sends reminders or collection notices
for past-due receivables. These actions are considered when calculating the loss allowance.

The loss allowance for cash and cash equivalents is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected losses.
These impairment losses are calculated on short-term exposures. The company considers the credit risk related to
its cash and cash equivalents to be low given its banks’ credit ratings. It has not recognised impairment losses on
other non-derivative financial assets (trade receivables) during the period.

The loss allowance covers impairment losses on trade receivables and other non-derivative financial assets.
However, if it is certain it will not recover the outstanding amount, the related non-derivative financial asset is
accordingly impaired directly.

**37. Contingent liabilities**

The company and some of its employees are involved in an ongoing criminal proceeding with respect to the
liability of entities under Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The proceeding started with a report filed by a
competitor, Linkem S.p.A. on 14 October 2016, alleging the unauthorised use of radio frequencies, and hence the
allegations are theft (article 624.2 of the Criminal Code), fraud (article 640.2.1 of the Criminal Code) and
disruption of the freedom of trade or industry (article 513 of the Criminal Code). The latter allegation has been
dismissed and, on 25 January 2021, the public prosecutor requested that the other two allegations of involvement
in crimes as per article 110 of the Criminal Code be dismissed.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Condensed interim financial information_
_at 30 June 2021_

On 15 February 2021, Linkem S.p.A. appealed as per article 410 of the Criminal Code against the dismissal
application. At the date of preparation of this report, a date for the hearing before the preliminary investigation
judge of the Busto Arsizio Court has not been set.

Based on its internal checks and its legal counsel’s advice, the company does not deem that probable risks
currently exist that would require it to set up a specific provision.

**38. Events after the reporting date**

On 19 July 2021, an agreement with Partners Group, a top global investment manager, was announced for the
sale of 75% of its share capital. On behalf of its clients, Partners Group will acquire Searchlight Capital Partners’
investment and part of Cometa S.p.A.’s investment in EOLO. Cometa S.p.A. will retain the remaining 25%.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

**Notes to the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2021**

**1.** **Business**

EOLO S.p.A. (“EOLO” or the “company”) is a national telecommunications operator and market leader in the
supply of ultra-broadband FWA (fixed wireless access) services to the residential, business and wholesale
sectors.

Set up in 1999 in Varese as NGI, the company’s core business is the supply of wireless connectivity services. In
2007, it developed a wireless broadband internet access service marketed under the “EOLO” brand (which then
became the company’s name in 2016).

At the forefront of the search for innovative technological solutions to eliminate the digital divide, EOLO’s
mission is to guarantee the right to connectivity focusing on the individual in order to improve their quality of
life and create value for businesses.

EOLO provides its services using its proprietary TLC infrastructure comprising fibre optic and radio
transmission nodes located throughout Italy. Its network is developed in northern and central Italy while a
massive investment plan was rolled out in 2019 to expand intensively into southern Italy.

At 31 March 2021, EOLO has 494 employees based in its headquarters in Busto Arsizio (Varese), located in a
20,000 square metre campus with offices, research labs, a logistics hub, conference centre, internal canteen and
recreational areas, and its operating offices in Rome and Padua.

The company, complied with the guidelines provided by the government and competent authorities in order to
deal with Covid-19 epidemiological emergency.

In order to guarantee its ability to ensure business continuity, the company kept its employees and consultants up
to date with any new information and urged its employees to work from home when possible while concurrently
safeguarding those employees who continued to come into work as it was impossible for them to work remotely.

Except as indicated above, no other significant impact on operations due to Covid-19 occurred.

EOLO has provided all its employees at the head office and those engaged in network maintenance work around
the country with personal protective equipment (PPE).

It also continued to revisit its safety measures and to update its Covid-19 protocol (“Common protocol of
measures to contain and curb the diffusion of Covid-19 in work environments”) about the office capacity, body
temperature scanning, shifts, sanitisation of common areas and canteen management.

The company participated in the procedure to request reimbursement of the costs incurred by companies to
purchase PPE specifically to contain and curb the diffusion of Covid-19 and received €143,740.95 on 8 July
2020.

**2.** **Ownership and group membership**

Since 22 December 2017, EOLO has been 51% owned by Cometa S.p.A., registered office at Via Gran San
Bernardo 12, Busto Arsizio (Varese), tax code 07674300962, fully paid-up share capital of €10,000,000, and
49% by Searchlight Capital Partners EPC UK Limited, registered office at
Conduit Street 56, London, VAT no. GB277722276.

As described in the directors’ report, the company engaged external advisors during the year to identify possible
opportunities and non-recurring transactions. Specifically, it is evaluating whether to modify its current
ownership structure.

**3.** **Basis of preparation**

**_Statement of compliance with the IFRS_**

The financial statements at 31 March 2021 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and related interpretations (SIC/IFRIC), endorsed by the European Union and in
force at the reporting date, and the measures issued to implement article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/2005. The
Italian regulations introduced to transpose Directive 2013/34/EU are also applicable, when compatible, to
companies that prepare their financial statements under the IFRS.

**_Financial statements_**

The financial statements are based on the accounting records at 31 March 2021 and have been prepared on a
going concern basis. They are accompanied by a directors’ report and these notes and comprise:

    - statement of financial position: assets and liabilities are presented as current or non-current and the
amounts to be settled or recovered within or after 12 months of the reporting date are described in the
notes to each asset and liability;

    - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income: costs are classified by nature and the
operating profit or loss and the profit or loss before tax are presented as separate sub-totals;

F-45

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

    - statement of changes in equity: this statement shows the company’s comprehensive income (expense),
owner transactions and details of each equity item presented;

    - statement of cash flows: this presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Cash flows from operating activities are presented using the indirect method, under which the profit or
loss for the year is adjusted for non-monetary transactions, the postponement or accrual of previous or
future collections or payments and revenue related to cash flows from investing or financing activities.

The purpose of these notes is to present the basis of preparation, the disclosures required by the IFRS and not
included in other parts of the financial statements as well as any other information not provided in the financial
statements but necessary to reliably present the company’s operations.

The statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the
statement of cash flows are prepared in Euros (the company’s functional currency) without decimal points. The
figures in the statement of changes in equity and these notes are prepared in thousands of Euros, unless specified
otherwise.

Moreover, the mandatory captions required by IAS 1 with nil balances for both the current and previous years
have not been included in the financial statements.

**_Approval of the financial statements_**

The company’s board of directors approved the financial statements at 31 March 2021 on 15 July 2021. They
have been audited by KPMG S.p.A. and will be presented to the company’s shareholders. The board of directors
may change the financial statements up until the date of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve them. The
shareholders also have the right to request changes to the financial statements.

**_Use of judgements and estimates_**

In preparing these financial statements and notes, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting
date. These judgements and estimates are based on information available at the date of preparation of the
financial statements, management’s experience and other relevant information. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. Estimates are used to measure assets, amortisation and depreciation, deferred tax assets, loss
allowances, employee benefits and provisions. Management revisits the estimates and judgements regularly and
the effects of any changes are shown in profit or loss. Critical measurement processes and key judgements used
to apply the IFRS and that can significantly affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities or trigger the risk
that their carrying amount may be significantly different in the subsequent reporting period are described below.

These notes summarise the financial statements captions subject to a high degree of judgement or complexity that
are likely to require adjustments due to significant differences between estimates and actual results. The
following sections provide details of these estimates and judgements together with an explanation of the
calculation criteria used for each caption.

The areas that require significant estimates and judgements are:

   - identification of performance obligations and the term of contracts with customers, note 4 (n);
   - the period of time over which the incremental costs to obtain a contract and to fulfil a contract are
expensed, note 4 (n);
   - the useful life of property, plant and equipment, note 4 (b.3);
   - impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, note 4 (b.4);
   - right-of-use assets, note 4 (c);
   - the lease term depending on whether the company is reasonably certain it will exercise the extension
option, note 4 (c);
   - the fair value of share-based payments, note 4 (l);
   - provisions and contingent liabilities, notes 4 (h) and 37.

Management checks the estimates and judgements regularly. They are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations about future events that could have an impact on the company’s financial position and are
considered reasonable in the circumstances.

**4.** **Summary of the significant accounting policies**

**_(a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_**

_(a.1) Initial recognition and measurement_

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation
and any accumulated impairment losses.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised.

_(a.2) Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

_(a.3) Amortisation_

Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives and tested for impairment whenever there is indication of a
possible impairment loss. The company checks the amortisation period and method at the end of each year or
more frequently if necessary. Any changes to the amortisation pattern are applied prospectively. Amortisation is
calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following criteria:

    - software and licences are amortised over three or five years, depending on their residual income
generating potential;

    - development expenditure for internally-developed application software is amortised over three years;

    - rights to use radio frequencies are amortised over the contract term.

An intangible asset with a finite useful life is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition, recognised in profit or loss, is
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset.

**_(b) Property, plant and equipment_**

_(b.1) Initial recognition_

Property, plant and equipment are recognised and measured at cost as established by IAS 16. Therefore, they are
recognised at their purchase or production cost, including directly attributable costs and subsequently adjusted
for accumulated depreciation, any accumulated impairment losses and/or reversals of impairment losses. If
significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Land is not depreciated, even when it is acquired together with a building. The gain or loss on the sale of
property, plant, machinery, equipment or other assets is determined as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the
derecognition.

_(b.2) Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure and the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment are added
to the item’s carrying amount and capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
with the related item increase. All other costs are expensed when incurred.

F-47


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

When the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment is capitalised, the carrying
amount of the parts that are replaced is expensed.

The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed
when incurred.

_(b.3) Depreciation_

Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of
the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is
derecognised. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the
item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and
reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based
on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its
estimated realisable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant
part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates:

         - Buildings 3%

         - Network systems and equipment 10% - 20%

          - Assets under free loan 20% - 50%

Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use the company’s connectivity
services and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the
related contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet
depreciated is expensed

These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are
installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated.

Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment.

When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when
there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant
obsolescence, the company compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the
present value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary. If the conditions for the recognition of the
impairment loss are no longer valid in subsequent years, the loss is reversed up to the carrying amount the asset
would have had (net of depreciation) had the impairment loss never been recognised.

_(b.4) Impairment losses on non-financial assets_

When a non-financial asset shows indication of impairment at the reporting date, the company estimates its
recoverable amount, defined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, applying the
following definitions:

    - Value in use: this is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or
cash-generating unit (CGU). Specifically, the asset will generate cash flows, which will be discounted
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the asset. The cash flows are determined using internal business plans based on detailed
budgets and calculations prepared separately for each asset/cash-generating unit. The budgets do not
include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a
horizon of a maximum of five years.

    - Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company uses valuation models
based on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators.

F-48

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

IAS 36 does not require a formal estimate of the recoverable amount if there are no indicators of impairment. The
exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business
combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment.

When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, the company recognises a loss equal to the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, the
company checks whether the reasons for recognising an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if
not, estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of
goodwill, if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss
been recognised in prior years. The reversal is recognised through profit or loss.

**_(c) Leases_**

At the lease commencement date, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The
right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The company
measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the
company uses its incremental borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently
increased to reflect interest, reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in
future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or when the company changes its assessment of
an option to purchase the underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of
the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been
reduced to zero.

The company’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to:

    - physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals;

    - multi-year rights to use fibre optic sections (dark fibre IRU);

    - office buildings;

    - company cars;

    - data centre equipment and other assets (canteen equipment).

The company elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value. Therefore, it recognises the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

The company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under the new definition of IFRS 16, which
establishes that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components
from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease
components as a single lease component.

The company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in the statement of
financial position. The company recognises right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment
property in the specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease liabilities” in the
statement of financial position.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

The company has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the
reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the
carrying amount of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. It measures the right-of-use asset considering the
amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the date of initial recognition.

The company depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end
of the lease term, unless the lease transfers title to the underlying asset at the end of the lease term or, given the
cost of the right-of-use asset, the company expects to exercise the purchase option. In this case, the company
depreciates the right-of-use asset over its useful life determined using the same criteria as per property, plant and
equipment.

Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognised in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

**_(d) Non-derivative financial assets_**

Non-derivative financial assets include investments in equity instruments, trade receivables, other assets (other
financial assets), financial liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities (other financial liabilities).

All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., when the company becomes
a contractual party to the financial instrument.

Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, at initial recognition, the
company measures a financial asset at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial
asset.

At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at
their transaction price.

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated
with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the company
considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a
contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet
this condition.

In making this assessment, the company considers:

    - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

    - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;

    - prepayment and extension features; and

    - terms that limit the company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non- recourse features).

The company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the company neither transfers
nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial
asset.

The company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire. The company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the

F-50


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms
is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount
extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is
recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the
statement of financial position when, and only when, the company currently has a legally enforceable right to set
off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

_(d.1) Trade receivables and other assets_

Trade receivables and other assets (other financial assets) are classified as financial assets measured at amortised
cost and initially recognised at their transaction cost for trade receivables and their fair value for other assets,
which is usually their nominal amount. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost net of any identified
impairment losses. The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable using the present value of
the discounted cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The
company considers reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes
quantitative and qualitative information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well
as forward-looking information.

_(d.2) Current and non-current loans and borrowings_

Advances and loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of directly
attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. They are classified as current or non-current liabilities based on their settlement date.

_(d.3) Trade payables and other liabilities_

Trade payables and other liabilities (other financial liabilities), with due dates within normal commercial terms,
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

**_(e) Derivatives_**

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or
loss.

The company does not have derivatives designated as hedging instruments.

**_(f) Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash-in-hand and sight and short-term deposits. In accordance with IAS 7,
they are measured at their nominal amount, which equals their fair value.

**_(g) Share capital and other equity items_**

Transactions between the company and the owners acting in their capacity as owners may give rise to amounts
due to and from owners. The company recognises a financial asset with the owners when the owners have an
obligation to the company and a liability when it has an obligation to the owners.

Injections made by owners that do not have to be returned are recognised in the relevant equity item while loans
from owners that have to be repaid are recognised under liabilities.

**_(h) Provisions_**

The company recognises a provision when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event that can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation.

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

F-51


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

The discount rates do not reflect the risks for which future cash flows have been adjusted.

The company regularly reviews the provisions to reflect changes in the estimate of the costs, the payment/
settlement timing and the discount rate. Changes in the estimates are recognised in the same caption of the
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the provision or, when the liability relates to an
item of property, plant and equipment, as a balancing entry to the related asset.

Provisions include accruals for future costs of ongoing disputes and the present value of the costs to be incurred
to restore land used under lease.

**_(i) Employee benefits_**

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefits where the company, and sometimes its employees, pay
fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and the company will have no legal or constructive obligation
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits.

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans that are not defined contribution plans. Defined benefit
plans may be unfunded or they may be wholly or partly funded by the contributions by an entity, and sometimes
its employees, into an entity or fund, that is legally separate from the reporting entity and from which the
employee benefits are paid. The vested amount is projected into the future to estimate the amount to be paid upon
termination of the employment relationship and subsequently discounted to consider the time value of money
before effective payment.

Adjustments to the liability for employee benefits are determined using actuarial assumptions, based on
demographic and financial variables, recognised on an accruals basis in line with the service necessary to obtain
the benefit.

The benefits vested in a year by employees and the interest cost on the amount accrued at the start of the year and
any changes during the year are recognised in “Personnel expenses” in profit or loss. The gain or loss arising on
the actuarial calculation is recognised in “Actuarial gains (losses)” under other comprehensive income.

The company engages a third party actuary to perform the actuarial valuation. Following the amendments to
Italian post-employment benefits (“TFR”) by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and
regulations (the pension reform) issued early in 2007:

    - TFR vested up until 31 December 2006 is treated as a defined benefit plan under IAS 19. The benefits
earned by employees in the form of post-employment benefits, paid when the employment relationship
ends, are recognised over the vesting period;

    - TFR accrued after 1 January 2007 is treated as a defined contribution plan and benefits accrued during
the year are entirely recognised as a cost, while the benefits not yet paid into the fund are recognised
under “Other current liabilities”.

**_(l) Share-based payments_**

Cash-settled share-based payment plans are part of the remuneration package of the beneficiaries. Therefore, the
cost is the fair value of the instruments recognised under “Personnel expenses” over the period from the award
date to the settlement date, with an increase in the related liability. The company remeasures the fair value of the
liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or
loss.

The cost of the liability is recognised using the same criteria for the liability set out above.

**_(m) Foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the company’s functional currency at the exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions.

F-52


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the
exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a
foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or
loss and presented within financial expense.

**_(n) Revenue from contracts with customers_**

The company applies IFRS 15 to recognise revenue from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is
recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of
control - at a point in time or over time - requires judgement.

IFRS 15 requires that revenue be recognised using a five-step model:

    - identify the contract(s) with a customer;

    - identify the performance obligations in the contract;

    - determine the transaction price;

    - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

    - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

_(n.1) Performance obligations and revenue recognition criteria_

The process underlying the company’s recognition of revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 is summarised below:

    - the contract is identified when the parties approve the contract and identify their rights and obligations,
i.e., when the contract becomes legally binding;

    - the duration of the contract with customer has been defined on the basis of the contract term agreed
with the customer (mainly 24 months);

    - the company has identified a single performance obligation for its connectivity services; it does not
account for the performance obligations related to the other services provided with its connectivity
services separately, as their separate accounting would not alter how it recognises revenue;

    - the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the customer, including any
promotions, covering the entire contract term.

    - the company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling price. Revenue from nonrefundable up-front activation fees, which do not constitute a separate
performance obligation and do not convey a material right to customers, is deferred over the contract term;

    - the company recognises revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. It usually invoices
revenues and collects payment on a two-monthly basis in advance.

Contracts with non-business customers generally provide for advance payment, which is not considered a
significant financing component given that advance payment is normal business practice and average payments
are usually made over less than 12 months.

_(n.2) Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil a contract_

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract, comprising commissions paid to agents and brokers, are
recognised in profit or loss over the contract term (24 months).

The costs to fulfil a contract, including the cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio
transceiver at a new customer, are recognised over the contract term (24 months). The costs of initial installation
are recognised in “Property, plant and equipment”. Should the contract be terminated, the incremental costs of
obtaining the contract and the costs to fulfil it are expensed.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

**_(o) Government grants_**

Government grants are initially recognised at fair value as deferred income if the company is reasonably certain
it will receive them and will comply with the attached conditions. They are subsequently recognised as other
income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset to which they relate.

**_(p) Personnel expenses_**

Personnel expenses includes remuneration, social security contributions, accruals for post-employment benefits,
other employee benefits, benefits for directors and consultants and other personnel costs (medical check-ups,
travel and canteen).

**_(q) Financial income and expense_**

Financial income includes interest on invested liquidity, dividends, gains on the sale of available-for-sale
financial assets, fair value gains on financial assets at FVTPL, exchange gains and gains on derivatives
recognised in profit or loss.

Financial expense includes interest on loans and finance leases, exchange losses, impairment losses on financial
assets and losses on derivatives recognised in profit or loss. Borrowing and lease costs are recognised in profit or
loss using the effective interest method.

Interest income and expense is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest
method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts
through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability.

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of
the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial
assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by
applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer creditimpaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

**_(r) Income taxes_**

_(r.1) Current taxes_

The company determines its income taxes on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the tax expense determined on
an accruals basis under the enacted tax laws. The tax rates and laws applied to calculate the amount are those
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Current taxes that arises from a transaction or event which
is recognised outside profit or loss are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and, therefore, in
equity, together with the transaction or event to which they refer.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

_(r.2) Deferred taxes_

Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred taxes are not recognised for:

   - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the
extent that the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it
is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable
profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable
temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for

F-54


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the company’s business plans. Deferred tax assets
are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit
will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

**_(s) New standards_**

There are no standards that the company has not yet applied or adopted early that could affect it significantly.

The standards endorsed by the EU and applicable to the year ending 31 March 2022 are as follows:

1. Interest rate benchmark reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)

Standards not yet endorsed by the EU include:

1. IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts;

2. Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1);

3. Disclosures of accounting policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2);

4. Definition of accounting estimates (Amendments to IAS 8);

5. Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associates or joint ventures (Amendments to IFRS
16 and IAS 28).

The company is evaluating the possible effect of applying the above standards and amendments.

**_(t) Measurement of fair value_**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous
market to which the company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

A number of the company’s accounting policies and disclosure obligations require the measurement of fair
values for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When one is available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use
of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the company measures assets
and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the company determines that the fair value on initial
recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active
market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are
judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair
value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price.
Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument
but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

The reduction in “Sundry amounts” at 31 March 2021 is due to the advances given to employees in the previous
year.

Amounts due from the parent at 31 March 2020 related to the company’s IRES tax losses transferred to Cometa
S.p.A. and solely usable by it due to the expiry of the domestic tax consolidation scheme provided for by article
117 and following articles of Presidential decree no. 917/1986 on 31 March 2019.

This amount was reclassified as a tax asset at 31 March 2021 after the transfer (as allowed by article 43-ter of
Presidential decree no. 602/73) of part of the excess IRES tax losses recognised by the parent due to its higher
payments made.

At 31 March 2021, the tax assets mostly comprise the tax asset for research and development activities (€399
thousand) and the IRES tax asset as per the previous paragraph (€648 thousand).

The financing of €145,000 thousand provided by a syndicate of Italian and international banks on 17 December
2019 comprises the following facilities:

    - refinancing facility of €85,000 thousand, fully provided at 31 March 2021. The related financial
liability amounts to €78,330 thousand at the reporting date;

    - capex facility of €50,000 thousand to be used for investments as part of the business plan; during the
year, an additional €10,000 thousand was drawn down compared to the previous year end in two
instalments on 23 December 2020 and 26 March 2021. The related financial liability amounts to
€18,731 thousand at the reporting date;

    - revolving credit facility of €10,000 thousand, which has not been used at 31 March 2021.

The financing is secured by collateral on the company’s assets (a first level special lien on plant and machinery).

The financial liability is net of €2,839 thousand arising from amortised-cost accounting.

This new non-current financing has a covenant based on the company’s leverage ratio (debt/gross operating
profit ratio) as set out in the related agreement. Compliance with this covenant is checked twice a year on
31 March and 30 September. It has been complied with at the reporting date.

In addition to the above financing, the company’s majority shareholder, Cometa S.p.A., provided it with a
€10,000 thousand loan in the previous year. The related agreement includes a subordination clause, whereby this
loan is repaid only after the above-mentioned syndicate financing.

**Closing balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,583** **3,692**

The main actuarial assumptions are set out in the following table (shown as weighted averages):

**31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**

Annual discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.72% 1.42%
Annual inflation rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.80% 1.20%
Annual post-employment benefits growth rate . . . . . . . . . 2.10% 2.40%
Annual real salary growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.50% 0.50%

Should any reasonably possible changes in the actuarial assumptions have taken place at the reporting date, they
would not have had a significant impact on the benefits’ carrying amounts.

The company introduced a five-year long-term incentive plan (LTIP) on 1 September 2018 for its directors and/
or managers and/or key employees.

Under this plan, beneficiaries are awarded a bonus (€2,670 thousand at 31 March 2021) which is included in their
remuneration. This bonus is calculated using a multiplier mechanism based on the increase in the company’s
value compared to a benchmark defined in the plan regulation. In addition, the plan has various payment options
(including partial options) including should the company’s shares be sold (cash-settled), the company be listed
(equity-settled) or upon the benefits’ natural maturity date (cash-settled).

The company engaged an external expert to estimate the plan’s fair value at the reporting date. This expert
applied the relevant valuation criteria and calculated the plan’s fair value to be the present value (at each
reference date) of the remuneration streams to be paid to the beneficiaries using the binomial model. The expert
also considered an estimate of the company’s enterprise value at the reporting date compared to the benchmark
defined in the plan regulation.

Specifically, the expert calculated the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2020 assuming the benefits would be settled
at their natural maturity date and using an enterprise value at that date estimated using the discounted cash flow
method (WACC of 8.48%) and the 2021-2025 business plan prepared by the company’s directors.

The expert’s estimate of the plan’s fair value at 31 March 2021 considered the directors’ assessment of the
possible change in ownership in the short term as well as, given the reference context, an enterprise value at the
reporting date calculated using a market comparables approach, and the status of the negotiations. As a result, the
estimated vesting periods were revised.

The main parameters used to apply this model are summarised below:

**31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**

Total benefits vested . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . N/A €2.41 million
Risk-free rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . N/A 0.03%
Standard deviation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . N/A 23.40%

**Fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€17.355** **€** **1.727**

Volatility was calculated as a standard deviation of the monthly share prices over a horizon equal to the holding
period before each reference date used for the estimate compared to listed comparable companies.

The expert prepared sensitivity analyses showing that the plan’s fair value is sensitive to changes in the estimate
of the company’s enterprise value at the reference dates.

**_Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers_**

No debt or equity instruments of Eolo are traded in a public market, nor is Eolo in the process of filing its
financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any
class of instruments in a public market, consequently IFRS 8 on segment reporting is not applicable.

The following table shows revenue from contracts with customers broken down by geographical segment,

The company uses the following methods and main assumptions to determine the fair value of financial
instruments:

    - non-derivative financial assets: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows discounted at
the reporting-date market interest rate. Their fair value is the same as their carrying amount as it is
already net of impairment losses;

    - loans and bank loans and borrowings: they bear floating interest rates and, therefore, there are no
significant differences between their carrying amount and fair value, also because they are presented
net of the related cost;

    - trade payables and other liabilities: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows
discounted at the reporting-date market interest rate. Their carrying amount is a reasonable
approximation of their fair value;

F-71


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

    - derivative financial liabilities: their fair value equals the present value of the expected cash flows
estimated using observable market parameters, compared to the prices of the counterparty financial
intermediary.

**_Fair value hierarchy_**

There are three levels:

    - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an
entity can access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most
reliable evidence of fair value and if there is no principal market, the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability shall be identified;

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2
input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Instruments included in
Level 2 are assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals;

    - Level 3: inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to
measure fair value to the extent that Level 2 inputs are not available.

Derivative financial liabilities are recognised at Level 2 fair value. The carrying amount of the company’s other
financial assets and liabilities, calculated as described above, is a reasonably approximation of their fair value.

**_Financial risk management_**

The company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

    - market risk: interest rate risk and currency risk;

    - liquidity risk;

    - credit risk.

The company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for its risk appetite and risk appetite framework.

The company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by it, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the company’s activities. The
company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The risk of adverse changes in interest rates on the currency markets mostly relates to the non-current credit
facilities agreed in the previous year.

The related agreement establishes an interest rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR for the drawn-down amounts.

Given the type of credit facilities and market trends, the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into
hedges to mitigate or eliminate this risk.

It is not obliged to do so under the terms of the loan agreements.

Had the interest rates been 1% higher at the reporting date, the company’s equity and loss for the year would
have been respectively lower or higher, net of the related tax, by approximately €1 million. Moreover, the
company has not considered potential extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be foreseen.

The company does not measure any financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) nor
does it designate derivatives as fair value hedges.

**_Currency risk_**

Trade receivables are not exposed to currency risk as the related transactions solely take place in Euros.

While the company undertakes transactions with suppliers in foreign currency, the amounts involved are
immaterial and, therefore, it is not significantly exposed to currency risk for its trade payables.

The company’s exposure to currency risk is as follows:

**31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**
_€’000_ **€** **USD** **€** **USD**

**Trade payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,141** **4,855** **1,310** **1,436**

The following main exchange rates have been applied:

**Average annual rate** **Closing rate**
**2020/2021** **2019/2020** **31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**

**USD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 1.1686 1.1112 1.1725 1.0956

Had the above currencies appreciated or depreciated by 10%, the company’s equity and loss for the year would
have increased/decreased by approximately €415 thousand, net of the related tax. This sensitivity analyses
assumes that all the other variables, specifically interest rates, would not change and it does not consider the
effect of planned sales and purchases.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Cash flows generated by operating activities are held in the company’s current accounts with major banks and
possibly invested in low-risk short-term instruments, whose yield is linked to changes in interest rates.

The treasury department closely monitors the company’s net financial position to manage and optimise its
commitments with suppliers and banks.

The company manages its liquidity effectively by using the most suitable sources of funding for its needs.

The unused available credit facilities at 31 March 2021 are:

    - capex facility: €30,000 thousand available upon request depending on the company’s need to make
investments to achieve its business plan;

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2021_

    - revolving facility: €10,000 thousand to temporarily meet liquidity requirements;

    - advances of €9,098 thousand on SDD collections. The advances are available before the bank has
checked collection;

    - import financing of €190 thousand. The bank pays the foreign supplier upon receipt of the invoice in
Euros or foreign currency in advance;

    - short-term loans of €500 thousand to cover temporary liquidity requirements.

In addition to the above facilities, the banks have provided guarantees for a total of €6,262 thousand at the
reporting date, including €5,000 thousand to Intracom S.A. for the purchase of radio antennas.

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts
are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting

Cash inflows and outflows shown in the above table reflect the contractual cash flows and undiscounted interest
of derivative financial liabilities held for risk management purposes, which are not usually extinguished before
the related contract expires.

Interest to be paid on floating rate loans shown in the table is calculated using reporting-date market rates, which
may fluctuate. Future cash flows of contingent consideration and derivatives could differ from the amounts
presented above if the interest or exchange rates or the conditions of the underlying change.

_at 31 March 2021_

Excluding these financial liabilities, the cash flows are not expected to take place before the expected date or for
significantly different amounts.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk related to non-business customers is minimal as payments are made in advance. With respect to
business customers, the company checks its trade receivables at each reporting date to identify any objective
evidence of impairment due to events that have taken place since their initial recognition. It considers whether
the customer has significant financial difficulties, demonstrated by its inability to make payments or the possible
commencement of court-approved creditors settlement procedures. The loss allowance always matches the trade
receivables’ expected lifetime losses.

All the trade receivables are due from Italian customers.

There is no significant concentrations with single customers.

_Impairment_

The company has a loss allowance to cover estimated losses on trade receivables and other assets, which it tests
for impairment individually (when the amounts involved are significant) or collectively (on groups of similar
assets for unidentified losses). Trade receivables are broken down by ageing bracket in the following table:

**31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **15,344** **12,535**

The loss allowance of €4,759 thousand at 31 March 2021 (€3,170 thousand at 31 March 2020) mostly refers to
trade receivables past due by more than 360 days, net of payments on account received from the same customers.

Changes in the loss allowance for trade receivables are shown below:

_€’000_ **31/03/2021** **31/03/2020**

**Opening balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **3,170** **2,090**
Utilisations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (141) (188)
Accruals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,730 1,268

**Closing balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,759** **3,170**

The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable based on the present value of the discounted
cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The company considers
reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes quantitative and qualitative
information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well as forward-looking
information.

The company regularly checks its exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and takes suitable
mitigation actions when necessary. Specifically, its policies provide that it sends reminders or collection notices
for past-due receivables. These actions are considered when calculating the loss allowance.

The loss allowance for cash and cash equivalents is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected losses.
These impairment losses are calculated on short-term exposures. The company considers the credit risk related to
its cash and cash equivalents to be low given its banks’ credit ratings. It has not recognised impairment losses on
other non-derivative financial assets (trade receivables) during the year.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**

_at 31 March 2021_

The loss allowance covers impairment losses on trade receivables and other non-derivative financial assets.
However, if it is certain it will not recover the outstanding amount, the related non-derivative financial asset is
accordingly impaired directly.

**37. Contingent liabilities**

The company and some of its employees are involved in an ongoing criminal proceeding with respect to the
liability of entities under Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The proceeding started with a report filed by a
competitor, Linkem S.p.A., on 14 October 2016, alleging the unauthorised use of radio frequencies, and hence
the allegations are theft (article 624.2 of the Criminal Code), fraud (article 640.2.1 of the Criminal Code) and
disruption of the freedom of trade or industry (article 513 of the Criminal Code). The latter allegation has been
dismissed and, on 25 January 2021, the public prosecutor requested that the other two allegations of involvement
in crimes as per article 110 of the Criminal Code be dismissed.

On 15 February 2021, Linkem S.p.A. appealed as per article 410 of the Criminal Code against the dismissal
application. At the date of preparation of this report, a date for the hearing before the preliminary investigation
judge of the Busto Arsizio Court has not been set.

Based on its internal checks and its legal counsel’s advice, the company does not deem that probable risks
currently exist that would require it to set up a specific provision.

**38. Government grants**

Pursuant to Law no. 124/2017 and the related simplification introduced by article 3-quater.2 of Decree law no.
135/2018, it is noted that the company received public assistance as recorded in the national state aid register.

_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

**Notes to the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2020**

**Introduction**

On 20 April 2020, the company’s board of directors resolved that the company’s financial statements would be
drawn up under the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and related interpretations (IFRIC)
endorsed by the European Union at that date and the measures issued to implement article 9 of Legislative decree
no. 38/2005 starting from those as at and for the yaer ended 31 March 2020.

The last set of financial statements prepared in accordance with the Italian financial reporting standards (“OIC”)
was at 31 March 2019.

**1.** **Business**

EOLO S.p.A. (“EOLO” or the “company”) is a national telecommunications operator and market leader in the
supply of ultra-broadband FWA (fixed wireless access) services to the residential, business and wholesale
sectors.

Set up in 1999 in Varese as NGI, the company’s core business is the supply of wireless connectivity services. In
2007, it developed a wireless broadband internet access service marketed under the “EOLO” brand (which then
became the company’s name in 2016).

At the forefront of the search for innovative technological solutions to eliminate the digital divide, EOLO’s
mission is to guarantee the right to connectivity focusing on the individual in order to improve their quality of
life and create value for businesses.

EOLO provides its services using its proprietary TLC infrastructure comprising fibre optic and radio
transmission nodes located throughout Italy. Its network is developed in northern and central Italy while a
massive investment plan was rolled out in 2019 to expand intensively into southern Italy.

At 31 March 2020, EOLO has 452 employees based in its headquarters in Busto Arsizio (Varese), located in a
20,000 square metre campus with offices, research labs, a logistics hub, conference centre, internal canteen and
recreational areas, and its operating offices in Rome and Padua.

The company, complied with the guidelines provided by the government and competent authorities in order to
deal with Covid-19 epidemiological emergency.

In order to guarantee its ability to ensure business continuity, the company kept its employees and consultants up
to date with any new information and urged its eomployees to work from home when possible while concurrently
safeguarding those employees who continued to come into work as it was impossible for them to work remotely.

Except as indicated above, no other significant impact on operations due to Covid-19 occurred. Starting from
1 April, EOLO has provided all its employees at the head office and those engaged in network maintenance work
around the country with personal protective equipment (PPE).

It also revisited its safety measures and to update its Covid-19 protocol (“Common protocol of measures to
contain and curb the diffusion of Covid-19 in work environments”) about the office capacity, body temperature
scanning, shifts, sanitisation of common areas and canteen management.

**2.** **Ownership and group membership**

Since 22 December 2017, EOLO has been 51% owned by Cometa S.p.A., registered office at Via Gan San
Bernardo 12, Busto Arsizio (Varese), tax code: 07674300962, fully paid-up share capital of €10,000,000, and
49% by Searchlight Capital Partners EPC UK Limited, registered office at
Conduit Street 56, London, VAT no. GB277722276.

The last set of financial statements prepared in accordance with the Italian financial reporting standards (“OIC”)
was at 31 March 2019.

The date of transition to the IFRS is 1 April 2018 and its effects and disclosure on the financial statements are
provided in note 41 (Transition to the IFRS). This note shows the effects on the company’s statement of financial
position at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 and its statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
for the year ended 31 March 2019. It also includes a reconciliation of equity and the profit for the year prepared
in accordance with the OIC and IFRS at the above dates.

The company has restated the comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2019 in accordance with the
IFRS endorsed by the European Union. In addition, the statement of financial position includes the opening
balances at 1 April 2018, also prepared in accordance with the IFRS.

**_Financial statements_**

The financial statements are based on the accounting records at 31 March 2020 and have been prepared on a
going concern basis. They are accompanied by a directors’ report and these notes and comprise:

    - statement of financial position: assets and liabilities are presented as current or non-current and the
amounts to be settled or recovered within or after 12 months of the reporting date are described in the
notes to each asset and liability;

    - statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income: costs are classified by nature and the
operating profit or loss and pre-tax profit or loss are presented as separate sub-totals;

    - statement of changes in equity: this statement shows the company’s comprehensive income (expense),
owner transactions and details of each equity item presented;

    - statement of cash flows: this presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Cash flows from operating activities are presented using the indirect method, under which the profit or
loss for the year is adjusted for non-monetary transactions, the postponement or accrual of previous or
future collections or payments and revenue related to cash flows from investing or financing activities.

The purpose of these notes is to present the basis of preparation, the disclosures required by the IFRS and not
included in other parts of the financial statements as well as any other information not provided in the financial
statements but necessary to reliably present the company’s operations.

The statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the
statement of cash flows are prepared in Euros (the company’s functional currency) without decimal points. The
figures in the statement of changes in equity and these notes are prepared in thousands of Euros, unless specified
otherwise.

Moreover, the captions required by IAS 1 with nil balances for both the current and previous years have not been
included in the financial statements.

**_Approval of the financial statements_**

The company’s board of directors approved the financial statements at 31 March 2020 on 21 September 2020.
They have been audited by KPMG S.p.A. and will be presented to the company’s shareholders. The board of
directors may change the financial statements up until the date of the shareholders’ meeting called to approve
them. The shareholders also have the right to request changes to the financial statements.

**_Use of judgements and estimates_**

In preparing these financial statements and notes, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting
date. These judgements and estimates are based on information available at the date of preparation of the
financial statements, management’s experience and other relevant information. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. Estimates are used to measure assets, amortisation and depreciation, deferred tax assets, loss
allowances, employee benefits and provisions. Management revisits the estimates and judgements regularly and
the effects of any changes are shown in profit or loss. Critical measurement processes and key judgements used
to apply the IFRS and that can significantly affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities or trigger the risk
that their carrying amount may be significantly different in the subsequent reporting period are described below.

These notes summarise the financial statements captions subject to a high degree of judgement or complexity that
are more likely to require adjustments due to significant differences between estimates and actual results. The
following sections provide details of these estimates and judgements together with an explanation of the
calculation criteria used for each caption.

The areas that require significant estimates and judgements are:

    - identification of performance obligations and the term of contracts with customers, note 4 (n);

F-90


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

    - the period of time over which the incremental costs to obtain a contract and to fulfil a contract are
expensed, note 4 (n);

    - the useful life of property, plant and equipment, note 4 (b.3);

    - impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, note 4 (b.4);

    - right-of-use assets, note 4 (c);

    - the lease term depending on whether the company is reasonably certain it will exercise the extension
option, note 4 (c);

    - the fair value of share-based payments, note 4 (l);

    - provisions and contingent liabilities, notes 4 (h) and 38.

Management checks the estimates and judgements regularly. They are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations about future events that could have an impact on the company’s financial position and are
considered reasonable in the circumstances.

**4.** **Summary of the significant accounting policies**

**_(a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_**

_(a.1) Initial recognition and measurement_

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation
and any accumulated impairment losses.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised.

_(a.2) Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

_(a.3) Amortisation_

Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives and tested for impairment whenever there is indication of a
possible impairment loss. The company checks the amortisation period and method at the end of each year or
more frequently if necessary. Any changes to the amortisation pattern are applied prospectively. Amortisation is
calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following criteria:

    - software and licences are amortised over three or five years, depending on their residual income
generating potential;

    - development expenditure for internally-developed application software is amortised over three years;

    - rights to use radio frequencies are amortised over the contract term.

An intangible asset with a finite useful life is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition, recognised in profit or loss, is
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset.

**_(b) Property, plant and equipment_**

_(b.1) Initial recognition_

Property, plant and equipment are recognised and measured at cost as established by IAS 16. Therefore, they are
recognised at their purchase or production cost, including directly attributable costs and subsequently adjusted
for accumulated depreciation, any accumulated impairment losses and/or reversals of impairment losses. If
significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

F-91


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

Land is not depreciated, even when it is acquired together with a building. The gain or loss on the sale of
property, plant, machinery, equipment or other assets is determined as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the
derecognition.

_(b.2) Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure and the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment are added
to the item’s carrying amount and capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
with the related item increase. All other costs are expensed when incurred.

When the cost of replacing parts of some items of property, plant and equipment is capitalised, the carrying
amount of the parts that are replaced is expensed.

The cost of non-routine maintenance that extends the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated over the item’s useful economic life. The cost of routine maintenance is expensed
when incurred.

_(b.3) Depreciation_

Depreciation of an item of property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use until the earlier of
the date that asset is classified as held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) and the date that the asset is
derecognised. Any changes to the depreciation pattern are applied prospectively. The depreciable amount is the
item’s carrying amount less its estimated disposal proceeds at the end of its useful life, if significant and
reasonably determinable. Depreciation is calculated using rates that reflect the item’s estimated useful life based
on the company’s plans which include its physical wear and tear and technological obsolescence and its
estimated realisable value net of the scrapping costs. When an asset is composed of more than one significant
part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is calculated on a systematic basis over the asset’s estimated useful life using the following rates:

            - Buildings 3%

            - Network systems and equipment 10% - 20%

            - Assets under free loan 20% - 50%

Assets under free loan include assets given to customers on a free loan basis to use the company’s connectivity
services and the cost of initially installing them. The cost of initially installing them has a useful life based on the
related contract term (mainly 24 months), in case of early withdrawal of the contract the portion not yet
depreciated is expensed.

These assets continue to be classified as “Assets under construction and payments on account” until they are
installed at the customer’s premises/residence. After their installation, the cost is reclassified and depreciated.

Depreciation is also calculated on temporarily idle equipment.

When there is an indication of a possible impairment loss on an item of property, plant and equipment, i.e., when
there is a significant decrease in the asset’s market value, significant technological changes or significant
obsolescence, the company compares its carrying amount, regardless of the accumulated depreciation, to the
present value of its future cash flows and impairs it where necessary. If the conditions for the recognition of the
impairment loss are no longer valid in subsequent years, the loss is reversed up to the carrying amount the asset
would have had (net of depreciation) had the impairment loss never been recognised.

_(b.4) Impairment losses on non-financial assets_

When a non-financial asset shows indication of impairment at the reporting date, the company estimates its
recoverable amount, defined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell applying the
following definitions:

    - Value in use: this is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or
cash-generating unit (CGU). Specifically, the asset will generate cash flows, which will be discounted

F-92


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the asset. The cash flows are determined using internal business plans based on detailed
budgets and calculations prepared separately for each asset/cash-generating unit. The budgets do not
include the effects of non-recurring transactions (restructurings, sales and acquisitions) and cover a
horizon of a maximum of five years.

    - Fair value: the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company uses valuation models
based on listed shares, market multiples and other available indicators.

IAS 36 does not require a formal estimate of the recoverable amount if there are no indicators of impairment. The
exceptions to this rule are assets that are not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in a business
combination, which must be tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment.

When the carrying amount of a non-financial asset is impaired, the company recognises a loss equal to the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its recoverable amount. In addition, at each year end, the
company checks whether the reasons for recognising an impairment loss (or reversal thereof) still exist and, if
not, estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An impairment loss may be reversed, except in the case of
goodwill, if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal of impairment losses may not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss
been recognised in prior years. The reversal is recognised through profit or loss.

**_(c) Leases_**

IFRS 16 redefines how to recognise a lease. It replaces IAS 17 - Leases, IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an
arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 - Operating leases - Incentives and SIC-27 - Evaluating the substance of
transactions involving the legal form of a lease.

IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make
lease payments. The standard also provides exemptions for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value.

The company’s leases that fall under the scope of IFRS 16 mostly relate to:

    - physical space to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals;

    - multi-year rights to use fibre optic sections (dark fibre IRU);

    - office buildings;

    - company cars;

    - data centre equipment and other assets (canteen equipment).

The company elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value. Therefore, it recognises the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

The company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach in its financial statements at
31 March 2020. Therefore, the effects of initially applying the standard have been recognised at 1 April 2018
with the recognition of right-of-use assets and other lease liabilities. The company has depreciated the
right-of-use assets and recognised financial expense on the lease liabilities.

In accordance with IFRS 16, the company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease under its new
definition, which establishes that a lease is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right the control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

It has elected to adopt the practical expedient for company car leases and not to separate non-lease components
from lease components and, instead, to account for each lease component and any associated non-lease
components as a single lease component.

As required by IFRS 16, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most of its leases in
the statement of financial position. . The company recognises right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition
of investment property in the specific “Right-of-use assets” caption and the related liability under “Lease
liabilities” in the statement of financial position.

At the lease commencement date, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The
right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The company
measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the
company uses its incremental borrowing rate. It usually uses the latter rate. The lease liability is subsequently
increased to reflect interest, reduced to reflect the lease payments made and remeasured if there is a change in
future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine them, there is a change in the
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or when the company changes its assessment of
an option to purchase the underlying asset, to extend the lease or terminate it.

The company has estimated the lease term for leases which have an extension option. Its assessment of the
reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option affects the estimate of the lease term and, especially, the
carrying amount of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. In order to apply the modified retrospective
approach to the above leases, the company has adopted the practical expedient to rely on past experience to
determine the lease term.

At the date of initial recognition, the company measured the lease liabilities at the present value of the lease
payments that were not paid at that date, discounted using its incremental borrowing rate at 1 April 2018. It
measured right-of-use assets considering the amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at
or before this date.

Any impairment losses on the right-of-use asset are determined and recognised in accordance with IAS 36—
Impairment of assets.

**_(d) Non-derivative financial assets_**

Non-derivative financial assets include investments in equity instruments, trade receivables, other assets (other
financial assets), financial liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities (other financial liabilities).

All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., when the company becomes
a contractual party to the financial instrument.

Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, at initial recognition, the
company measures a financial asset at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial
asset.

At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at
their transaction price.

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated
with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

F-94

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the company
considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a
contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet
this condition.

In making this assessment, the company considers:

    - contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

    - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;

    - prepayment and extension features; and

    - terms that limit the company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non-recourse features).

The company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the company neither transfers
nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial
asset.

The company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire. The company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the
modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms
is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount
extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is
recognised in profit or loss.Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the
statement of financial position when, and only when, the company currently has a legally enforceable right to set
off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

_(d.1) Trade receivables and other assets_

Trade receivables and other assets (other financial assets) are classified as financial assets measured at amortised
cost and initially recognised at their transaction cost for trade receivables and their fair value for other assets,
which is usually their nominal amount. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost net of any identified
impairment losses. The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable using the present value of
the discounted cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The
company considers reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes
quantitative and qualitative information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well
as forward-looking information.

_(d.2) Current and non-current loans and borrowings_

Advances and loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of directly
attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. They are classified as current or non-current liabilities based on their settlement date.

_(d.3) Trade payables and other liabilities_

Trade payables and other liabilities (other financial liabilities), with due dates within normal commercial terms,
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

**_(e) Derivatives_**

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or
loss.

The company does not have derivatives designated as hedging instruments.

F-95


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

**_(f) Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash-in-hand and sight and short-term deposits. In accordance with IAS 7,
they are measured at their nominal amount, which equals their fair value.

**_(g) Share capital and other equity items_**

Transactions between the company and the owners acting in their capacity as owners may give rise to amounts
due to and from owners. The company recognises a financial asset with the owners when the owners have an
obligation to the company and a liability when it has an obligation to the owners.

Injections made by owners that do not have to be returned are recognised in the relevant equity item while loans
from owners that have to be returned are recognised under liabilities.

**_(h) Provisions_**

The company recognises a provision when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event that can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation.

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

The discount rates do not reflect the risks for which future cash flows have been adjusted.

The company regularly reviews the provisions to reflect changes in the estimate of the costs, the payment/
settlement timing and the discount rate. Changes in the estimates are recognised in the same caption of the
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the provision or, when the liability relates to an
item of property, plant and equipment, as a balancing entry to the related asset.

Provisions include accruals for future costs of ongoing disputes and the present value of the costs to be incurred
to restore land used under lease.

**_(i) Employee benefits_**

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefits where the company and sometimes its employees pay
fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and the company will have no legal or constructive obligation
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits.

Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans that are not defined contribution plans. Defined benefit
plans may be unfunded or they may be wholly or partly funded by the contributions by an entity, and sometimes
its employees, into an entity or fund, that is legally separate from the reporting entity and from which the
employee benefits are paid. The vested amount is projected into the future to estimate the amount to be paid upon
termination of the employment relationship and subsequently discounted to consider the time value of money
before effective payment.

Adjustments to the liability for employee benefits are determined using actuarial assumptions, based on
demographic and financial variables, recognised on an accruals basis in line with the service necessary to obtain
the benefit.

The benefits vested in a year by employees and the interest cost on the amount accrued at the start of the year and
any changes during the year are recognised in “Personnel expenses” in profit or loss. The gain or loss arising on
the actuarial calculation is recognised in “Actuarial gains (losses)” under other comprehensive income.

F-96


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

The company engages a third party actuary to perform the actuarial valuation. Following the amendments to
Italian post-employment benefits (“TFR”) by Law no. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and
regulations (the pension reform) issued early in 2007:

    - TFR vested up until 31 December 2006 is treated as a defined benefit plan under IAS 19. The benefits
earned by employees in the form of post-employment benefits, paid when the employment relationship
ends, are recognised over the vesting period;

    - TFR accrued after 1 January 2007 is treated as a defined contribution plan and benefits accrued during
the year are entirely recognised as a cost, while the benefits not yet paid into the fund are recognised
under “Other current liabilities”.

**_(l) Share-based payments_**

Cash-settled share-based payment plans are part of the remuneration package of the beneficiaries. Therefore, the
cost is the fair value of the instruments recognised under “Personnel expenses” over the period from the award
date to the settlement date, with an increase in the related liability. The company remeasures the fair value of the
liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or
loss.

**_(m) Foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the company’s functional currency at the exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the
exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a
foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or
loss and presented within financial expense.

**_(n) Revenue from contracts with customers_**

The company applies IFRS 15 to recognise revenue from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is
recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of
control-at a point in time or over time-requires judgement.

The company has elected to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effects in opening equity
at the date of initial application (1 April 2018, which is the date of transition to the IFRS).

IFRS 15 requires that revenue be recognised using a five-step model:

    - identify the contract(s) with a customer;

    - identify the performance obligations in the contract;

    - determine the transaction price;

    - allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

    - recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

_(n.1) Performance obligations and revenue recognition criteria_

The process underlying the company’s recognition of revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 is summarised below:

    - the contract is identified when the parties approve the contract and identify their rights and obligations,
i.e., when the contract becomes legally binding;

F-97


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

    - the duration of the contract with customer has been defined on the basis of the contract term agreed
with the customer (mainly 24 months);

    - the company has identified a single performance obligation for its connectivity services; it does not
account for the performance obligations related to the other services provided with its connectivity
services separately, as their separate accounting would not alter how it recognises revenue;

    - the transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the customer, including any
promotions, covering the entire contract term.;

    - the company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation on the basis of the relative
stand-alone selling price. Revenue from nonrefundable up-front activation fees, which do not constitute
a separate performance obligation and do not convey a material right to customers, is deferred over the
contract term;

    - the company recognises revenue over time as it satisfies the performance obligation. It usually invoices
revenues and collects payment on a two-monthly basis in advance.

Contracts with non-business customers generally provide for advance payment, which is not considered a
significant financing component given that advance payment is normal business practice and average payments
are usually made over less than 12 months.

_(n.2) Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil a contract_

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract, comprising commissions paid to agents and brokers, are
recognised in profit or loss over the contract term (24 months).

The costs to fulfil a contract, including the cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio
transceiver at a new customer, are recognised over the contract term (24 months). The costs of initial installation
are recognised in “Property, plant and equipment”. Should the contract be terminated, the incremental costs of
obtaining the contract and the costs to fulfil it are expensed.

**_(o) Government grants_**

Government grants are initially recognised at fair value as deferred income if the company is reasonably certain
it will receive them and will comply with the attached conditions. They are subsequently recognised as other
income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset to which they relate.

**_(p) Personnel expense_**

Personnel expense includes remuneration, social security contributions, accruals for post-employment benefits,
other employee benefits, benefits for directors and consultants and other personnel costs (medical check-ups,
travel and canteen).

**_(q) Financial income and expense_**

Financial income includes interest on invested liquidity, dividends, gains on the sale of available-for-sale
financial assets, fair value gains on financial assets at FVTPL, exchange gains and gains on derivatives
recognised in profit or loss.

Financial expense includes interest on loans and finance leases, exchange losses, impairment losses on financial
assets and losses on derivatives recognised in profit or loss. Borrowing and lease costs are recognised in profit or
loss using the effective interest method.

Interest income and expense is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest
method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts
through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability.

F-98


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of
the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial
assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by
applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer creditimpaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

**_(r) Income taxes_**

_(r.1) Current taxes_

The company determines its income taxes on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the tax expense determined on
an accruals basis under the enacted tax laws. The tax rates and laws applied to calculate the amount are those
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Current taxes that arises from a transaction or event which
is recognised outside profit or loss are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and, therefore, in
equity, together with the transaction or event to which they refer.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

_(r.2) Deferred taxes_

Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred taxes are not
recognised for:

   - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the
extent that the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it
is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future
taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of
taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits,
adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the company’s business plans.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable
profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

**_(s) New standards_**

**_(t) Measurement of fair value_**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous
market to which the company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance
risk.

A number of the company’s accounting policies and disclosure obligations require the measurement of fair
values for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When one is available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use
of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the company measures assets
and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction
price - i.e., the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the company determines that the fair value on
initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an
active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable
inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially
measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the
transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life
of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the
transaction is closed out.

The main actuarial assumptions are set out in the following table (shown as weighted averages):

Annual real salary growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.50% 0.50% 0.50%

Should any reasonably possible changes in the actuarial assumptions have taken place at the reporting date, they
would not have had a significant impact on the benefits’ carrying amounts.

The company approved a five-year long-term incentive plan (LTIP) on 1 September 2018 for its directors and/or
managers and/or key employees.

The company engaged an external expert to estimate the plan’s fair value at the reporting dates. This expert
applied the relevant valuation criteria and calculated the plan’s fair value to be the present value (at each
reference date) of the remuneration streams to be paid to the beneficiaries using the binomial model.

The main parameters used to apply this model are summarised below:

**31/03/2020** **31/03/2019** **01/04/2018**

Total benefits vested . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 2.41 million € 2.45 million € 1.80 million

**Fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€1.727 million** **€1.445 million** **€1.102 million**

- Figure calculated considering recent non-recurring transactions (acquisition of 49% by SearchLight Capital
Partners in December 2017 and subsequent capital increase).

Volatility was calculated as a standard deviation of the monthly share prices over a horizon equal to the holding
period before each reference date used for the estimate compared to listed comparable companies.

The company uses the following methods and main assumptions to determine the fair value of financial
instruments:

    - non-derivative financial assets: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows discounted at
the reporting-date market interest rate. Their fair value is the same as their carrying amount as it is
already net of impairment losses;

    - loans and bank loans and borrowings: they bear floating interest rates and, therefore, there are no
significant differences between their carrying amount and fair value, also because they are presented
net of the related cost;

**_EOLO S.p.A._**

_at 31 March 2020_

    - trade payables and other liabilities: their fair value is estimated using the expected cash flows
discounted at the reporting-date market interest rate. Their carrying amount is a reasonable
approximation of their fair value;

    - derivative financial liabilities: their fair value equals the present value of the expected cash flows
estimated using observable market parameters, compared to the prices of the counterparty financial
intermediary.

**_Fair value hierarchy_**

There are three levels:

    - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an
entity can access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most
reliable evidence of fair value and if there is no principal market, the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability shall be identified;

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2
input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Instruments included in
Level 2 are assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals;

    - Level 3: inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to
measure fair value to the extent that Level 2 inputs are not available.

Derivative financial liabilities are recognised at Level 2 fair value. The carrying amount of the company’s other
financial assets and liabilities, calculated as described above, is a reasonably approximation of their fair value.

**_Financial risk management_**

The company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

    - market risk: interest rate risk and currency risk;

    - liquidity risk;

    - credit risk.

The company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for its risk appetite and risk appetite framework.

The company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by it, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the company’s activities. The
company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The risk of adverse changes in interest rates on the currency markets mostly relates to the non-current credit
facilities agreed in the previous year.

The related agreement establishes an interest rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR for the drawn-down amounts.

Given the type of credit facilities and market trends, the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into
hedges to mitigate or eliminate this risk.

It is not obliged to do so under the terms of the loan agreements.

Had the interest rates been 1% higher at the reporting date, the company’s equity and profit for the year would
have been respectively lower or higher, net of the related tax, by approximately €1 million. Moreover, the
company has not considered potential extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be foreseen.

The company does not measure any financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) nor
does it designate derivatives as fair value hedges.

**_Currency risk_**

Trade receivables are not exposed to currency risk as the related transactions solely take place in Euros.

While the company undertakes transactions with suppliers in foreign currency, the amounts involved are
immaterial and, therefore, it is not significantly exposed to currency risk for its trade payables

The company’s exposure to currency risk is as follows:

**31/03/2020** **31/03/2019** **01/04/2018**
_€’000_ **€** **USD** **€** **USD** **€** **USD**

Had the above currencies appreciated or depreciated by 10%, the company’s equity and profit for the year would
have increased/decreased by approximately €130 thousand, net of the related tax.

This sensitivity analyses assumes that all the other variables, specifically interest rates, would not change and it
does not consider the effect of planned sales and purchases.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Cash flows generated by operating activities are held in the company’s current accounts with major banks and
possibly invested in low-risk short-term instruments, whose yield is linked to changes in interest rates.

The treasury department closely monitors the company’s net financial position to manage and optimise its
commitments with suppliers and banks.

The company manages its liquidity effectively by using the most suitable sources of funding for its needs.

The unused available credit facilities at 31 March 2020 are:

    - capex facility: €40,000 thousand available upon request depending on the company’s need to make
investments to achieve its business plan;

    - advances of €11,500 thousand on SDD collections. The advances are available before the bank has
checked collection;

    - import financing of €4,303 thousand. The bank pays the foreign supplier upon receipt of the invoice in
Euros or foreign currency in advance;

    - short-term loans of €1,000 thousand to cover temporary liquidity requirements.

In addition to the above facilities, the banks have provided guarantees for a total of €6,087 thousand at the
reporting date, including €5,000 thousand to Intracom S.A. for the purchase of radio antennas.

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts
are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting

**71,233** **78,705** **17,661** **43,683** **17,361**

Cash inflows and outflows shown in the above table reflect the undiscounted contractual cash flows of derivative
financial liabilities held for risk management purposes, which are not usually extinguished before the related
contract expires.

Interest to be paid on floating rate loans shown in the table is calculated using reporting-date market rates, which
may fluctuate. Future cash flows of contingent consideration and derivatives could differ from the amounts
presented above if the interest or exchange rates or the conditions of the underlying change.

Excluding these financial liabilities, the cash flows are not expected to take place before the expected date or for
significantly different amounts.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk related to non-business customers is minimal as payments are made in advance. With respect to
business customers, the company checks its trade receivables at each reporting date to identify any objective
evidence of impairment due to events that have taken place since their initial recognition. It considers whether
the customer has significant financial difficulties, demonstrated by its inability to make payments or the possible
commencement of court-approved creditors settlement procedures. The loss allowance always matches the trade
receivables’ expected lifetime losses.

All the trade receivables are due from Italian customers.

There is no significant concentrations with single customers.

_Impairment_

The company has a loss allowance to cover estimated losses on trade receivables and other assets, which it tests
for impairment individually (when the amounts involved are significant) or collectively (on groups of similar
assets for unidentified losses). Trade receivables are broken down by ageing bracket in the following table:

**31/03/2020** **31/03/2019** **01/04/2018**

The company checks whether the trade receivables are recoverable based on the present value of the discounted
cash flows. The loss allowance is always equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The company considers
reasonable and supportable information which is relevant and available. This includes quantitative and qualitative
information and analyses, based on past experience, of the trade receivables as well as forward-looking
information.

The company regularly checks its exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and takes suitable
mitigation actions when necessary. Specifically, its policies provide that it sends reminders or collection notices
for past-due receivables. These actions are considered when calculating the loss allowance.

The loss allowance for cash and cash equivalents is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit
losses. These impairment losses are calculated on short-term exposures. The company considers the credit risk
related to its cash and cash equivalents to be low given its banks’ credit ratings. It has not recognised impairment
losses on other non-derivative financial assets (trade receivables) during the year.

**36. Related parties**

The company’s related parties are its key management personnel, its parent and other related parties as defined

**38. Contingent liabilities**

The company and some of its employees are involved in an ongoing criminal proceeding with respect to the
liability of entities under Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The proceeding started with a report filed by a
competitor, Linkem S.p.A., on 14 October 2016, alleging theft (article 624.2 of the Criminal Code), fraud (article
640.2.1 of the Criminal Code) and disruption of the freedom of trade or industry (article 513 of the Criminal
Code). On 25 July 2019, the public prosecutor requested that the crime covered by article 513 of the Criminal
Code be dismissed. None of the parties allegedly injured by that crime has opposed the request for its dismissal
although they were regularly informed of this as per article 408 of the Criminal Code.

As no oppositions have been received, the preliminary investigation judge referred to the arguments presented in
the precautionary attachment order and ordered the dismissal of the allegation about the disruption of the
freedom of trade and industry “as there is no case to answer”. On 9 July 2019, the amount of €3,537,074.09,
which had been subjected to precautionary attachment in December 2018, was credited to one of the company’s
bank accounts.

In addition, based on its internal checks and its legal counsel’s advice, the company does not deem that probable
risks do not currently exist that would require it to set up a specific provision.

**39. Government grants**

Pursuant to Law no. 124/2017 and the related simplification introduced by article 3-quater.2 of Decree law no.
135/2018, it is noted that the company received public assistance as recorded in the national state aid register.

**40. Events after the reporting date**

The company participated in the procedure to request reimbursement of the costs incurred by companies to
purchase PPE specifically to contain and curb the diffusion of Covid-19 and received €143,740.95 on 8 July
2020.

**41. Transition to the IFRS**

As already specified in note 3, the financial statements at 31 March 2020 are the first prepared by the company in
accordance with the IFRS.

It has applied the accounting policies described in note 4 to prepare its financial statements at 31 March 2020, the
comparative figures as at 31 March 2019 and for the year then ended and the opening IFRS statement of financial
position at 1 April 2018 (date of transition to the IFRS). The opening IFRS statement of financial position at
1 April 2018 presents the adjusted figures from its financial statements prepared in accordance with the OIC (the
previously-applied reporting standards). This note discloses the effects of the transition from the OIC to the IFRS
on the company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.

_at 31 March 2020_

In addition, as required by IFRS 1 - First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting standards, the
company has referred to IFRS 1.IG.63 to present a reconciliation between the amounts determined in accordance
with the OIC and those redetermined in accordance with the IFRS both at the date of transition (1 April 2018)
and 31 March 2019 together with notes explaining the adjustments. Specifically, it prepared:

   - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March
2019;

   - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for
the year ended 31 March 2019;

   - a reconciliation of the OIC and IFRS equity as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019;

   - the company’s accounting policies, which show its elections in applying the IFRS;

   - notes to the reconciliation schedules.

**_(a) Basis of preparation of the financial statements restated in accordance with the IFRS_**

_(a.1) Introduction_

The company’s financial statements, restated in accordance with the IFRS, have been derived from the financial
statements drawn up under the OIC, which have been adjusted and reclassified to reflect the differences in the
presentation, recognition and measurement of captions required by the IFRS.

Specifically, the adjustments to ensure compliance with the IFRS in force at 31 March 2020 (IFRS first reporting
date) were applied to the opening statement of financial position as at 1 April 2018 (the date of transition to the
IFRS) and the financial statements at 31 March 2019 (comparative period), unless stated otherwise.

The transition to the IFRS is effectively a change in accounting policies and, therefore, as required by IFRS 1, its
effects are presented in opening equity at the date of transition (1 April 2018). The company has complied with
all the standards when preparing these financial statements.

_(a.2) First-time adoption of the IFRS_

The company has prepared its opening statement of financial position at the date of transition to the IFRS (1
April 2018) in accordance with IFRS 1.10, except for the exceptions and exemptions provided for by the same
standard and detailed later in this section, by:

   - recognising all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by the IFRS;

   - not recognising items as assets or liabilities if the IFRS do not permit such recognition;

   - reclassifying items that it recognised in accordance with the OIC as one type of asset, liability or
component of equity, but are a different type of asset, liability or component of equity in accordance
with the IFRS;

   - applying the IFRS in measuring all recognised assets and liabilities.

The company has elected to restate the opening statement of financial statement as at 1 April 2018 and the
financial statements at 31 March 2019 as follows: (a) assets and liabilities are recognised as current or noncurrent; (b) costs are classified by nature in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income;
(c) cash flows are presented using the indirect method.

_(a.3) Application of exceptions_

The company has considered all exceptions provide for by IFRS 1 as set out below:

(1) Estimates

The company’s estimates at the date of transition to the IFRS (1 April 2018) and at 31 March 2019 are consistent
with the estimates made for the same dates in accordance with the OIC, except when the estimates and related

F-126


-----

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

disclosures in accordance with the OIC are no longer relevant due to the company’s adoption of different
accounting policies with its transition to the IFRS. In this case, the estimates were not updated to reflect
information received subsequently. Changes in estimates that are appropriate are recognised prospectively.

(2) Classification and measurement of financial instruments, derecognition of financial assets and financial
liabilities, impairment losses on financial assets

The company has applied IFRS 9 prospectively from the date of transition to the IFRS (1 April 2018).

(3) Embedded derivatives

The company has assessed whether to separate embedded derivatives from their host contracts and account for
them as derivatives based on the conditions that existed at the more recent of the following two dates: the date on
which the company became a party to the contract and the date of any change in the contract terms that
significantly modifies the contract’s cash flows. It concluded that it did not have embedded derivatives that
needed to be separated from their host contracts.

(4) Government grants

At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company had not received government grants. Therefore, this exception
was not applicable.

(5) Hedge accounting

At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company did not have transactions that would qualify for hedge
accounting under the IFRS.

(6) Non-controlling interests

At 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, the company did not have business combinations with non-controlling
interests carried out in previous years. Therefore, this exception was not applicable.

(7) Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures and assets and liabilities of the parent

The parent, Cometa S.p.A., adopted the IFRS on 1 April 2018 (date of transition of its subsidiary to the IFRS).

(8) Investment entities

The company is not an investment entity and, therefore, this exception was not applicable.

_(a.4) Application of exemptions_

The company considered all the exemptions provided for by IFRS 1 as set out below:

(1) Revenue

The company has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effects in opening equity at the
date of initial application (1 April 2018 - the date of transition to the IFRS), without using any of the practical
expedients provided for by IFRS 15.C5.

(2) Contracts that contain a lease

The company has applied IFRS 16 retrospectively and, therefore, it recognised the cumulative effect of its
adoption on 1 April 2018 (the date of transition) by recognising additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

(3) Other exemptions

After considering the other exemptions granted by IFRS 1, the company found that they were not applicable to its
statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019.

**_(b) IFRS impacts on the statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 and on the_**
**_statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year_**
**_ended 31 March 2019_**

Due to the differences between the IFRS and the OIC and the company’s elections under the IFRS, as described
in the previous paragraph, it has restated the figures presented under the OIC, which has affected equity and the
comprehensive income (expense) as shown in the following tables.

The statements of financial position as at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 and the statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income and significant adjustments made to the statement of cash flows for the year ended
31 March 2019 are presented in the following pages.

The statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income show the
following for each caption:

    - the carrying amount determined in accordance with the OIC and reclassified under the IFRS;

    - the IFRS adjustments, including the reclassifications arising from the application of IFRS 16 and
IFRS 15;

    - the IFRS carrying amount.

**41.4 Significant adjustments made to the statement of cash flows**

As a result of the application of IFRS 16, the lease payments (principal) are recognised under cash flows from
financing activities (€11,405 million). As allowed by IAS 7, the company elected to also recognise the related
interest payments under cash flows from financing activities.

There are no other significant adjustments between the statement of cash flows presented under the IFRS and that
prepared under the OIC.

_(i) Costs that cannot be capitalised_

Under the OIC, in certain cases, start-up costs can be recognised with the consent of the board of statutory
auditors at cost, net of accumulated amortisation calculated on a systematic basis. Under the IFRS, the cost of
starting up new operations or new products or processes may not be capitalised.

Therefore, the company derecognised them from intangible assets generating:

    - a decrease of €26 thousand and €11 thousand in intangible assets and equity at 1 April 2018 and
31 March 2019, respectively;

    - a decrease of €16 thousand in amortisation for the year ended 31 March 2019.

_(ii) IFRS 16 reclassifications_

The caption includes the reclassification of right-of-use assets of €15,503 thousand and €16,546 thousand at
1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, respectively.

The reclassifications to right-of-use assets relate to:

    - costs paid to obtain multi-year rights to use fibre optic sections (dark fibre IRU);

    - costs paid in advance to place EOLO equipment for the reception and transmission of radio signals and
the regeneration of fibre optic connections in third party sites.

**_(b) Property, plant and equipment_**

_(i) Capitalisation of directly attributable costs_

Under IAS 16, the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management can be capitalised.

Therefore, the company has capitalised these costs under property, plant and equipment generating:

    - an increase of €1,442 thousand and €1,944 thousand in property, plant and equipment and equity at
1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, respectively;

    - an increase of €543 thousand in depreciation for the year ended 31 March 2019;

    - a decrease of €1,045 thousand in the cost of purchasing materials and services for the year ended
31 March 2019.

_(ii) Restoration costs_

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment under IAS 16 includes the cost of dismantling and removing
the item and restoring the site on which it is located when it has a legal or construction obligation to do so. The
related liability is provided for in a provisions for risks and charges at its present value. The capitalised cost is
expensed over the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment (10 years) through its depreciation.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

Therefore, the company has recognised the carrying amount of these costs included under property, plant and
equipment generating:

    - an increase of €505 thousand and €470 thousand in property, plant and equipment at 1 April 2018 and
31 March 2019, respectively;

    - a decrease of €52 thousand in equity at 31 March 2019 without affecting equity at 1 April 2018, the
date of initial application;

    - an increase of €52 thousand in depreciation for the year ended 31 March 2019;

_(iii) IFRS 16 reclassifications_

The caption includes the reclassification of right-of-use assets of €4,178 thousand and €4,069 thousand at
1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, respectively.

The reclassifications to right-of-use assets relate to:

    - costs paid in advance to use third party spaces;

    - incremental costs, upgrading of the physical space of third parties, already capitalised under property,
plant and equipment.

**_c. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities_**

In accordance with IFRS 16, the company recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in its statement of
financial position. The right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the
lease liability. The company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date. The company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method and,
therefore, the cumulative effect of its application was recognised at 1 April 2018 with the recognition of
right-of-use assets and other lease liabilities.

**_EOLO S.p.A._**
_Financial statements_
_at 31 March 2020_

Accordingly, the company has recognised:

    - right-of-use assets of €67,880 thousand and €82,686 thousand at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

    - lease liabilities of €47,712 thousand and €62,644 thousand at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

    - a decrease of €726 thousand in equity at 31 March 2019 without affecting equity at 1 April 2018;

    - depreciation and amortisation of €10,805 thousand (including reclassifications to intangible assets
described in notes “a, Intangible assets” and “b, Property, plant and equipment”);

    - interest expense of €2,049 thousand.

Reference should be to made to the notes “a, Intangible assets”, “b, Property, plant and equipment”, “g, Other
_assets” and “j, Trade payables” for information about the reclassifications._

**_d. Contract costs_**

**IFRS balances . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,594** **3,062**

In accordance with IFRS 16, the incremental costs to obtain a contract (commissions paid to agents and brokers)
and costs to fulfil a contract (cost of subsequent installations after the initial installation of the radio transceiver
at a new customer—CPE) are deferred over the contract term (24 months).

The company has recognised the carrying amount of these costs generating:

    - an increase of €3,062 thousand and €4,594 thousand in contract costs at 1 April 2018 and
31 March 2019, respectively;

    - a decrease of €1,405 thousand and €4,361 thousand in other assets at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

    - an increase of €1,656 thousand and €233 thousand in equity at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

    - an increase of €1,423 thousand in the cost of services due to the deferral of commissions recognised in
profit or loss under the OIC up until December 2017.

**_e. Deferred tax assets and liabilities_**

In accordance with IFRS 9, the company measures credit losses using the expected credit loss approach. This
implies a prospective approach as the estimate of the expected credit losses, determined collectively and
individually, is based on reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and does
not only include historical and current information but also forward-looking information.

The application of IFRS 9 led to the following adjustments:

    - a decrease of €925 thousand in trade receivables and equity at 31 March 2019;

    - an increase of €925 thousand in the loss allowance and an impairment loss of the same amount
recognised in profit or loss for the year ended 31 March 2019.

As part of its business activities and in accordance with IAS 37, the company is required to dismantle the
infrastructure and restore the site when it has a legal and constructive obligation to do so as per the lease for the
areas/buildings on which the equipment is placed after use of the site has been discontinued.

Measurement of the provision for restoration costs is affected by estimates of the unit restoration costs and the
inflation/discount rates, which the company is unable to control.

The provision for restoration costs includes the present value of the costs to be incurred to restore the leased sites.

The application of IAS 37 led to the following adjustments:

    - an increase of €505 thousand and €534 thousand in the provisions at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

_(i) Post-employment benefits_

Under IAS 19, the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR) are a defined benefit plan under which the company
has an obligation to pay employees benefits when the employment relationship ends, calculated considering their
years of service, their remuneration and the inflation rate.

Unlike the practice under the OIC, the related liability is calculated using actuarial techniques that consider when
the employees will leave the company, their remuneration over their period of service and the fact that payment
of the benefits is deferred (discounting). An independent expert has measured the liability for the defined benefit
plan using actuarial techniques.

Therefore, the company has adjusted its future obligation generating:

    - an increase in post-employment benefits and a decrease in equity of €278 thousand and €451 thousand
at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, respectively;

    - a decrease of €40 thousand in personnel expenses at 31 March 2019;

    - an increase of €31 thousand in interest expense;

    - a decrease of €181 thousand in other comprehensive expense at 31 March 2019.

_(ii) Incentive plan_

In accordance with IFRS 2, cash-settled share-based payment plans are part of the remuneration package of the
beneficiaries. Therefore, the cost, which is the fair value of the instruments, is recognised under “Personnel
expenses” over the period from the award date to the vesting date, with an increase in the related liability.

The company remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with
any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss under personnel expenses.

Therefore, the company has reclassified the liability to employee benefits generating:

    - an increase in employee benefits and a decrease in equity of €168 thousand at 31 March 2019;

    - an increase of €168 thousand in personnel expenses at 31 March 2019.

There are no effects on equity at 1 April 2018 as the incentive plan was approved on 1 September 2018.

In accordance with IFRS 15, deferred income on the rendering of services is recognised in “Contract liabilities”
in the statement of financial position.

The transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract with the counterparty, including any
promotions, covering the entire contract term. The company has defined the contract term as 24 months, in line
with the contract terms defined by the parties.

The company has elected to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively, recognising the cumulative effects in opening equity
at the date of initial application (1 April 2018, which is the date of transition to the IFRS).

Application of this standard, especially with regard to the deferral of revenue from the activation of the
connectivity service and the recognition timing of any contractually-provided for promotions, led to:

    - an increase of €733 thousand and €2,273 thousand in contract liabilities at 1 April 2018 and
31 March 2019, respectively;

    - a decrease of €733 thousand and €2,274 thousand in equity at 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019,
respectively;

    - a decrease of €1,541 thousand in revenue and other income for the year ended 31 March 2019.
