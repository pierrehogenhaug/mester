Offering Circular Supplement No. 2 dated September 21, 2017


-----

**Changes to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

**Size of New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

We previously indicated in the preliminary offering circular that the New Senior Secured Credit

Facilities will consist of a seven-year $2,401.0 million Dollar term loan facility, or the “Dollar Term Loan
Facility,” a seven-year $599.0 million equivalent Euro term loan facility, or the “Euro Term Loan Facility,”
and a five-year New Revolving Facility of up to $250.0 million. As revised, the Dollar Term Loan Facility
will decrease by $599.0 million to $1,802.0 million, and the Euro Term Loan Facility will correspondingly
increase by $599.0 million equivalent to $1,198.0 million equivalent.

As a result of the foregoing changes to the respective components of the New Senior Secured

Credit Facilities, we expect changes to the unaudited pro forma financial information presented in the
preliminary offering circular to include:

    - a decrease in pro forma interest expense of approximately $6.3 million and $3.2 million
for the twelve and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively, with such
decreases being fully attributable to a reduction in cash interest;

    - a decrease in pro forma income tax benefit of approximately $2.5 million and $1.2 million
for the twelve and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively; and

    - a decrease in pro forma net loss of approximately $3.9 million and $1.9 million for the
twelve and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

There would be no change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet

presented in the preliminary offering circular as a result of the changes to the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities.

**Changes to Mandatory Prepayments**

Clause (a) under the heading “Description of Other Indebtedness—Mandatory Prepayments” in

the preliminary offering circular is revised in its entirety as follows:

(a) commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, an amount equal to 75% of
Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) during such
fiscal year and, at the option of the borrower, made after year-end and prior to the
payment due date) in excess of $15.0 million, with step-downs to 50%, 25% and 0%
based upon the achievement and maintenance of specified first lien secured net leverage
ratios;

All information (including all conforming changes to related disclosure) presented in the

preliminary offering circular is deemed to have changed to the extent affected by the changes described
herein.

**Potential Rollover of Class A Phantom LP Units**

We previously indicated in the preliminary offering circular that all Class A Phantom LP Units will

be settled and paid out in cash in connection with the Transactions. In connection with the Internal
Reorganization, the Class A Phantom LP Units may alternatively be rolled over.

If the Class A Phantom LP Units are rolled over, rather than settled and paid out in cash, the $5.1

million of share-based compensation liability, recorded within “Other liabilities” in the consolidated
balance sheet of Avantor as of June 30, 2017, would remain outstanding. As a result, we expect changes
to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 presented in the
preliminary offering circular to include:


-----

    - an increase in total liabilities of $5.1 million; and

    - a corresponding decrease in total equity of the same amount.

Additionally, under the heading “Use of Proceeds” in the preliminary offering circular there would

be a $5.1 million increase in cash expected to be paid to equityholders of Avantor and its subsidiaries,
which will be fully offset by a decrease in cash payments for other items.

In the event that the Class A Phantom LP Units are rolled over in connection with the

Transactions, all information (including all conforming changes to related disclosure) presented in the
preliminary offering circular would be deemed to have changed to the extent affected by the changes
described herein.

**Changes to Certain Disclosures in the Description of Senior Secured Notes**

All changes to the Description of Senior Secured Notes reflected in Annex A hereto are deemed

to be included in the preliminary offering circular.

**Changes to Certain Disclosures in the Description of Senior Unsecured Notes**

All changes to the Description of Senior Unsecured Notes reflected in Annex B hereto are

deemed to be included in the preliminary offering circular.

**General**

This offering circular supplement to the preliminary offering circular should be read together with

the preliminary offering circular before making a decision in connection with an investment in the
securities. The information in this offering circular supplement supersedes the information in the
preliminary offering circular to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.

**Annex A**

Changes to the Description of Senior Secured Notes


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

**General**

The Issuer will issue $1,401,050,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior first lien notes due 2024 (the

“Dollar Notes”) and €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior first lien notes due 2024 (the “Euro

_Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes” and each, a “Series of Notes”) pursuant to an indenture to be dated_
as of the Issue Date (the “Initial Indenture”) among the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as
trustee (the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes will
each be issued as a separate series, but, except as otherwise provided below, will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture (as defined below). On the Effective Date, upon the consummation of the Transactions,
Holdings and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and
together with the Initial Indenture, the “Indenture”) with the Trustee. The Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” Application will be made to list the Euro Notes
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and for the Euro Notes to be admitted to trading
thereto. There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted.

The Issuer will also offer $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior notes due 2025 (the

“Unsecured Notes”) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Initial Unsecured Indenture”) among
the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Unsecured Notes Trustee”). On the
Effective Date, upon the consummation of the Transactions, Holdings and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a
supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Unsecured Indenture” and, together with the Initial Unsecured Indenture, the
“Unsecured Indenture”) with the Unsecured Notes Trustee. The Unsecured Indenture will not be subject to the provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Unsecured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Description of Senior Notes.”

If the closing of this offering of the Notes occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, then, pending consummation of the

Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with
the closing of the offering of Notes on the Issue Date, deposit (x) the gross proceeds of this offering of the Dollar Notes
into a segregated escrow account (the “Dollar Escrow Account”), (y) the gross proceeds of this offering of the Euro Notes
into a segregated escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account” and, together with the Dollar Escrow Account, the “Escrow
_Accounts” and each an “Escrow Account”) and (z) the gross proceeds of the offering of Unsecured Notes into a_
segregated escrow account, in each case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (as
amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”), dated as of the Issue Date among the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Unsecured Notes Trustee and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as escrow
agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, each Series of
Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such Series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest on such Series of Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees,

does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the provisions of the
Indenture and the Notes, including the definitions of certain terms used therein. We urge you to read each of these
documents because they, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders. You may request copies of the
Indenture and the Notes at our address set forth under the heading “Summary.”

In this section of the Offering Circular, references to the “Issuer” are to Avantor, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and

not any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, in this section of the Offering Circular, references to the “Notes” are
to the $1,401,050,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior first lien notes due 2024 and the €500,000,000 aggregate

principal amount of % senior first lien notes due 2024 and exclude the Unsecured Notes.

**Brief Description of Notes**

Upon consummation of the Transactions, the Notes will be:

     - general senior debt obligations of the Issuer;


-----

dispositive restructuring plan (and each shall be deemed to have voted to reject any such plan) that is inconsistent with or
in violation of the terms of the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
Second Lien Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured
creditor) may propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan unless
such plan (a) pays off, in cash in full, all First Lien Obligations or (b) is accepted by the class of holders of First Lien
Obligations voting thereon in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Each Second Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Second Lien Secured Party, will

acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the First Lien Obligations and the Second Lien Obligations
constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the
Collateral, the Second Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the First Lien Obligations and must be separately
classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, if it is held that the claims of the First Lien Secured Parties and the Second Lien Secured Parties in respect of
the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a
plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Second Lien Representative, for itself and on
behalf of the applicable Second Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral
shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors
in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient
(for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Second Lien Secured Parties), the First Lien Secured Parties shall be
entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims,
all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such
insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Second Lien
Obligations, with each Second Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Second Lien Secured Party,
acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by
them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the
effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Second Lien Secured Parties.

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting Collateral

from the Liens securing the Notes and the First Lien Notes Obligations under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) to enable us to consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by the termination of capital

leases or the repossession of the leased property in a capital lease by the lessor) of such property or assets (to a
Person that is not the Issuer or a GuarantorSubsidiary of the Issuer) to the extent not prohibited
underconsummated in accordance with the covenant described under “Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to the

terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

(3) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event.

(4) the release of Excess Proceeds or Collateral Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the

conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer conducted in accordance with the Indenture; or

(5) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released (i) upon payment in full of

the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the
Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as
described below under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture as described under
“Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above.

Changes to the Description of Senior Unsecured Notes


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES**

**General**

The Issuer will issue $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of       % senior notes due 2025 (the
“Notes”) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Initial Indenture”) among the Issuer and The
Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). On the Effective Date, upon the
consummation of the Transactions, Holdings and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a supplemental indenture
(the “Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Initial Indenture, the “Indenture”) with the Trustee. The Indenture
will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer will also offer $1,401,050,000 aggregate principal amount of       % senior first lien notes due
2024 (the “Dollar Notes”) and €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of   % senior first lien notes due 2024 (the
“Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, “Secured Notes”) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue
Date (the “Initial Secured Indenture”) among the Issuer, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee
(the “Secured Notes Trustee”) and the collateral agent. On the Effective Date, upon the consummation of the
Transactions, Holdings and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental
_Secured Indenture” and together with the Initial Secured Indenture, the “Secured Indenture”) with the Trustee. The_
Secured Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Secured
Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
See “Description of Senior Secured Notes.”

If the closing of this offering of the Notes occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, then, pending consummation of
the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will,
concurrently with the closing of the offering of Notes on the Issue Date, deposit (x) the gross proceeds of the offering of
the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), (y) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Dollar
Notes into a segregated escrow account, and (z) the gross proceeds of this offering of the Euro Notes into a
segregated escrow account, in each case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (as
amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”), dated as of the Issue Date among
the Issuer, the Trustee, the Secured Notes Trustee and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as escrow
agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, the Notes
will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from
the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the
Guarantees, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, including the definitions of certain terms used therein. We urge you to read
each of these documents because they, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders. You may request
copies of the Indenture and the Notes at our address set forth under the heading “Summary.”

In this section of the Offering Circular, references to the “Issuer” are to Avantor, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and not any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, in this section of the Offering Circular, references to the
“Notes” are to the $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of   % senior notes due 2025 and exclude the Secured
Notes.

**Brief Description of Notes**

Upon consummation of the Transactions, the Notes will be:

     - general senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer;

     - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

     - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the Senior Credit_
Facilities and the Secured Notes) of the Issuer;

     - effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness (including the Senior Credit Facilities and the Secured
Notes) of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;


-----

Redemption for the Notes exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property (such excess amount, the “Due Amount”), the
Sponsor will be required, directly or indirectly through one of its subsidiaries, pursuant to the Sponsor Commitment Letter,
to transfer (or cause to be transferred) to the Issuer, an amount of cash in dollars equal to the accrued and unpaid interest
owing to the holders of the Notes sufficient to fund the Due Amount for the Notes. On the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property
(if any) to the Issuer.

The Sponsor Commitment Letter may not be amended by the Issuer or the Sponsor if it would materially adversely

impact the Sponsor’s commitment to fund the Due Amount in connection with any Special Mandatory Redemption for the
Notes. Each of the Trustee, the Secured Notes Trustee, and the Escrow Agent will have third-party beneficiary rights under
the Sponsor Commitment Letter solely for the purpose of (i) seeking specific performance of the Issuer’s right to cause the
Sponsor to fund its commitment to pay the Due Amount and (ii) preventing the Sponsor and the Issuer from amending the
Sponsor Commitment Letter in a manner that would materially adversely impact the Sponsor’s commitment to fund the
Due Amount.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as set forth under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” above, the Issuer will not be

required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders.” The Issuer, the Investors and their respective Affiliates may, at their discretion, at any time and
from time to time, acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases,
negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the circumstances set forth in the ninth paragraph under “—Repurchase at the

Option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior to,

2020.

At any time prior to, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a

part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and
Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium
as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption
hereunder, the “Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

On and after, 2020, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem the Notes, in

whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and
Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth
below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment or

Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in
the preceding clauses (1) through (20) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted


-----

Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant the Issuer will be entitled to divide
or classify (or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (20) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the
clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted

Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

As of the Effective Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not permit

any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence of the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as
set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted
Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to this covenant or
pursuant to the definition “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and
will not guarantee the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment” with

respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to
be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or
otherwise (collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), and issue shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if either (x) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00
or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Applicable Measurement Period would have been equal to or less than
6.90 to 1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been
issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such Applicable
Measurement Period; provided, further, that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors may not incur
Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the greater of (x)
$200.0150.0 million and (y) 20.015.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period of
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors
incurred pursuant to this paragraph, together with amounts incurred under clause (14)(x) of the next paragraph by
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, would be outstanding at such time.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) the incurrence of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities by the Issuer or any of its Restricted

SubsidiariesGuarantor and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder
(with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount
thereof), up to an aggregate principal amount then outstanding not to exceed the sum of (a) $5,500.0 million plus
the greater of (I) $825.0 million and (II) 82.5% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable

**the Option of Holders—Asset Sales” in satisfaction of the requirements of such covenant plus (b) an**
additional amount after all amounts have been incurred under clause (1)(a), if after giving pro forma effect to the
incurrence of such additional amount and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Secured

such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or portion thereof) in one of the above clauses or paragraphs; provided that
all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities on the Effective Date (after giving effect to the
Transactions), and any refinancing thereof, will at all times be treated as incurred on the Effective Dateand
**outstanding under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph; and may not be reclassified;**

(2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more

than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs above; and

(3) the principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under any clause of this covenant shall be determined

after giving effect to the application of proceeds of any such Indebtedness to refinance any such other
Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue

discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this
covenant. If Indebtedness originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1)
and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then
such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness will be deemed to have been
incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next
sentence. Any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) and (12) of the second
paragraph of this covenant shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in
connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of

Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was deemed to be
incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt, for purposes of this covenant;
_provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and_
such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be
