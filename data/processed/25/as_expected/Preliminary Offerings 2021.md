**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **CONFIDENTIAL**

**Avantor Funding, Inc.**
$800,000,000     % Senior Notes due 2029


Avantor Funding, Inc., or “Avantor Funding” or the “Issuer,” a Delaware corporation, is offering $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of    %
senior notes due 2029, or the “notes.”

The notes will mature on       , 2029. The Issuer will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in arrears on         and         of each year,
commencing on       , 2022.


The Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to       , 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering
memorandum. On or after       , 2024, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes at any time prior to       , 2024 using the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon the occurrence of certain
events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

The net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be used as part of the financing for the Acquisition (as defined herein). In the event this offering of
notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption provisions. If the Acquisition
is not consummated on or prior to December 31, 2021 (subject to the extension to a date not beyond February 28, 2022), or certain other conditions are not met, the
notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100% of the issue price thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest from the initial issue date to the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Vail Holdco Sub LLC, or “Holdings,” and each existing and
subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect domestic restricted subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Issuer) that also guarantee the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (as defined herein) and the Existing Notes (as defined herein), or collectively, the “guarantors,” and such guarantees, the “guarantees.” The notes will be
senior unsecured obligations and the notes and the related guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and guarantors’ existing and future
senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively
subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
Existing Secured Notes (as defined herein) and any other existing or future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In
addition, the notes and the related guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness and will be
structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including indebtedness under the A/R Facility (as defined herein).

There is currently no public market for the notes. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.


_Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 14 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection_
_with an investment in the notes._

**Offering price of the notes:       %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from         , 2021**

**the securities law of any other jurisdiction. The notes will not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons, except to persons reasonably**

contents of this offering memorandum as investment, legal or tax advice. You should consult your own counsel,

We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making any representation to you regarding the legality of an
investment in the notes by you under appropriate legal investment or similar laws.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to
be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in
connection with their consideration of the purchase of the notes and (2) in offshore transactions complying with

offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, nor may it be distributed or any of its
contents be disclosed to anyone other than the prospective investors to whom it is being provided.

In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and
agreements as indicated in this offering memorandum under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” The notes are
subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. You should be

See “Transfer Restrictions.”

This offering memorandum contains or incorporates by reference summaries, believed to be accurate, of
some of the terms of certain documents, but reference is made to the actual documents, copies of which will be
made available upon request. For the complete information contained in those documents, see “Where You Can
Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference.”

No person is authorized in connection with any offering made by this offering memorandum to give any
information or to make any representation not contained in or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum and, if given or made, any other information or representation must not be relied upon as having been
authorized by us or the initial purchasers. The information contained in or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum is as of the date hereof and subject to change, completion or amendment without notice. Neither the
delivery of this offering memorandum at any time nor any subsequent commitment to enter into any financing shall,


-----

under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the information set forth in or
incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum or in our affairs since the date of this offering memorandum.

In making an investment decision regarding the notes offered by this offering memorandum, you must rely
on your own examination of our company and the terms of this offering, including the merits and risks involved.
This offering is being made on the basis of this offering memorandum. Any decision to purchase notes in this
offering must be based on the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of notes at any time, and we and the initial purchasers
reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the notes, in whole or in part, and to allot to you less than
the full amount of the notes subscribed for by you. We are making this offering subject to the terms described in this
offering memorandum and the indenture related to the notes.

The notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the notes sold pursuant to this offering
memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, all of which will be deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC, and registered in its name or in the name of Cede & Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the
global certificates relating to the notes will be shown on, and transfers of such global certificates will be effected
only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the
global certificates, notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in
the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Book Entry; Delivery and Form.”

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes
to any person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. For a further description
of certain restrictions on the offer and sale of the notes, see “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about        , 2021,
which is the         business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+  ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second business day
before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who
wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second business day before delivery should consult their own
advisors.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

This offering memorandum includes or incorporates by reference market and industry data and forecasts
that we have derived from independent consultants, publicly available information, various industry publications,
other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates. Independent consultant reports, industry
publications and other published industry sources generally indicate that the information contained therein was
obtained from sources believed to be reliable.

Our internal data and estimates are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations
and other contacts in the markets in which we operate and our management’s understanding of industry conditions.
Although we believe that such information is reliable, we have not had this information verified by any independent
sources. Similarly, our internal research is based upon our understanding of industry conditions, and such
information has not been verified by any independent sources. Any estimates underlying such market-derived
information and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the independent
parties’ estimates and in our estimates.

into U.S. dollar amounts at specified exchange rates solely for convenience. These translations should not be
construed as representations that the U.S. dollar amounts represent such euro amounts or could be converted into
euro at the rate indicated as of any dates mentioned in this offering memorandum. Euro denominated borrowings
described in this offering memorandum on a historical basis have been translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange
rate in effect on the date of such balance sheet.

Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this offering memorandum (or in documents we
have incorporated by reference) may appear without the [®] or [™] symbols, but the absence of such symbols does not
indicate the registration status of the trademarks and is not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert,
to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable licensor to such trademarks and
trade names.

**PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES**

This offering memorandum contains, or incorporates by reference, certain financial measures, including
Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage, that are not
recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA,
Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage have been presented in this offering
memorandum as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included in this offering memorandum because
they are key metrics used by management to assess our financial performance. We use these measures to supplement
GAAP measures of performance in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting
decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We believe
such measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our


-----

industry and are helpful supplemental measures to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s core
operational performance as they exclude costs that do not relate to the underlying operation of their business and
include cost savings that are expected to occur.

Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are nonGAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a
measure of financial performance or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, nor should
they be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or other items. Additionally,
Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are not intended to be
a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect certain cash requirements
such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in
the future. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage contain
certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital
needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and/or amortized. Management compensates for these
limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of
other companies due to different methods of calculation.

In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net
Leverage, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been
inaccurate. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these adjustments as a projection that we will
achieve these benefits but rather only as an indication of our current expectations.

For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net
Leverage and reconciliations to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, see “Summary—Summary
Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be
reviewed by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the notes or the guarantees and we have no
present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the
Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes
will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum and the documents we incorporate by reference herein contain certain forwardlooking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as
assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. These statements include, but are not limited to,

“estimate,” “expect,” “plan” and “project” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify

factors, which may cause our actual results, performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Any statements contained or incorporated by reference herein that are not statements of historical facts
may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ
materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements.

Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. Should one or
more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results,
performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this offering memorandum as anticipated,
believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under
the heading “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report and
Quarterly Reports, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. Unless required by United States federal
securities laws, we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which

on the needs of laboratory scientists and include procurement, logistics, chemical and equipment tracking and
glassware autoclaving. In addition, we offer more complex and value-added scientific research support services such
as DNA extraction, bioreactor servicing, clinical and biorepository services and compound management. We deliver
these services in part through over 1,400 associates who are co-located with customers, working side-by-side with
their scientists every day.

Our 117-year legacy began in 1904 with the founding of the J.T. Baker Chemical Company. In 2010,
we were acquired by New Mountain Capital from Covidien plc. Since then, we have expanded through a series of
large acquisitions across the globe. In 2016, we merged with NuSil, a leading supplier of high-purity silicone
products for the medical device and aerospace industries that was founded in 1985. In 2017, we also acquired VWR
(the “VWR Acquisition”), a global manufacturer and distributor of laboratory and production products and services
founded in 1852 that now represents the primary ordering platform for our customers. Avantor, Inc. was
incorporated in Delaware in May 2017 in anticipation of our acquisition of VWR. We completed our initial public
offering (the “IPO”) through Avantor, Inc. and listed our shares on the NYSE in May 2019.

**_Recent Developments_**

_Proposed Acquisition_

On September 7, 2021, we announced that we entered into a Purchase Agreement and Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) the Masterflex bioprocessing business
and related assets (collectively, “Masterflex”) of Antylia Scientific, a privately held, portfolio company of
investment firms GTCR and Golden Gate Capital, which we expect will be EBITDA accretive. The all-cash
transaction is valued at $2.9 billion, subject to final adjustments at closing. The Purchase Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties and covenants and also includes indemnification provisions under which the
parties have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities. The Acquisition is subject to customary
closing conditions, including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. The closing of the Acquisition is not
subject to any financing condition. We currently expect the Acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2021.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with (i) approximately $966.9 million in
net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses) from our recent equity
offering that closed on September 16, 2021, (ii) $900.0 million in new term loan financing, each as described below,
(iii) cash on hand and (iv) borrowings under our A/R Facility, to finance the Acquisition and to pay related fees and
expenses. In this offering memorandum, references to the “Financing Transactions” refer to this offering, the Equity
Offering and the Term Loan Financing described below, and references to the “Transactions” refer to the Financing
Transactions and the Acquisition, including the application of the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions to
complete such transactions, as described herein. In addition, unless otherwise specified or the context requires
otherwise, references in this offering memorandum to the “consummation of the Acquisition” or similar expressions
shall be deemed to include the application of the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions to complete such
transactions, as described herein.

There is no assurance that the Transactions will be consummated on the terms contemplated or by the
time currently contemplated, or at all, or, if consummated, that the terms of the Acquisition, including the financing
thereof and the closing date, will not differ, perhaps substantially, from those currently contemplated or described in
this offering memorandum or the documents incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. This offering
is not conditioned on the completion of the Acquisition or the Term Loan Financing. In the event this offering of
notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special
mandatory redemption provisions. To the extent the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are
not met, we will redeem the notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on such notes from the initial issue date to the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

_Financing Transactions_

In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we have completed, or otherwise anticipate
entering into, the following financing transactions, collectively, the “Financing Transactions”:

      - the contribution from our issuance of 23,809,524 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of
$1,000.0 million (the “Equity Offering”), which was completed on September 16, 2021;

      - the issuance by Avantor Funding of $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes
offered hereby; and

      - the incremental borrowing by Avantor Funding of approximately $900.0 million in term loans
under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Term Loan Financing”).

_Preliminary Third Quarter 2021 Unaudited Revenues_

Our third quarter 2021 unaudited revenue is expected to be approximately $1.83 billion, increasing 14.3%
from the prior quarter and resulting in estimated organic revenue growth of approximately 10.2%.


-----

The estimated fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue results are preliminary, unaudited and subject to
completion, reflect management’s current views and may change as a result of management’s review of results and
other factors, including a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties.
Such preliminary results for the fiscal 2021 third quarter are subject to the finalization and closing of our accounting
books and records (which have yet to be performed), and should not be viewed as a substitute for full quarterly
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We caution
you that the estimated fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue estimates are not guarantees of future performance or
outcomes and that actual results may differ materially from those described above. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ from those described above are set forth in “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in the
offering memorandum. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new
information, future events or other factors. You should read this information together with the financial statements
and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” for prior periods incorporated by reference into the offering memorandum. Neither our independent
registered public accounting firm nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has audited, reviewed
or compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary results, nor have they expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance on the preliminary results.

**_Ownership and Corporate Structure_**

The following chart illustrates the ownership and corporate structure of Avantor and its subsidiaries and the
outstanding debt of such entities as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions. This chart is provided
for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated with, or all obligations of, the Issuer.

- The Existing Notes are, and the notes offered hereby will be, guaranteed on a joint and several basis by Holdings and each of
Holdings’ direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that guarantee obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and
Holdings’ existing and future direct or indirect material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuer, as borrower)
subject to customary exceptions.
(1) In connection with the Financing Transactions, we issued 23,809,524 shares of common stock in the Equity Offering for gross

proceeds of $1,000.0 million, which was completed on September 16, 2021. To the extent the Acquisition is not consummated, we
anticipate we will use the net proceeds from the Equity Offering for general corporate purposes.


-----

(2) Represents the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, consisting of (i) $1,320.3 million equivalent

aggregate principal amount of the Existing Euro Term Loan Facility and (ii) $1,526.5 million aggregate principal amount of the
Existing Dollar Term Loan Facility. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our Revolver and
we would have had $515.0 million of available borrowings thereunder (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). In addition,
as described in this offering memorandum, we intend to fund the Acquisition with the net proceeds from the Financing
Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, and we do not currently intend to draw on the
Revolver. However, the consummation of this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be dependent on the market and other
factors, and there is no assurance that such indebtedness will be incurred in full, or at all. In this event, we may fund a portion of the
Acquisition with borrowings under the Revolver.

In addition, in connection with the Transactions, we intend to incur $900.0 million in incremental term loans under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. There is no assurance that the Term Loan Financing will be incurred on the terms contemplated, or at all,
and the Acquisition and this offering are not conditioned on the completion of the Term Loan Financing. In addition, if the
Acquisition is not consummated, we do not expect to incur any borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in connection
with the Transactions.
(3) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2028 and the 3.875% Senior Notes due

2028, which were issued by Avantor Funding in July 2020. Reflects the U.S. dollar equivalent of the €400.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028. Represents an exchange rate of $1.185 to €1.00, determined as of June 30,
2021.
(4) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.625% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025, which were issued by

Avantor Funding in November 2020. Reflects the U.S. dollar equivalent of the €650.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
2.625% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025.
(5) As of June 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our A/R Facility and we would have had $300.0 million of

available borrowings thereunder (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). Avantor Receivables Funding, LLC, the borrower
under the A/R Facility, is not a guarantor of the Issuer’s existing debt. None of the net proceeds of borrowings under such
unrestricted subsidiary debt will be made available to support the operations or satisfy any corporate purposes of Avantor and
neither the Issuer nor any of its subsidiaries (other than Avantor Receivables Funding, LLC) is obligated to make payment on the
A/R Facility. In addition, as described in this offering memorandum, we intend to fund the Acquisition with the net proceeds from
the Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and $100.0 million of borrowings under our A/R Facility. However, the
consummation of this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be dependent on the market and other factors, and there is no
assurance that such indebtedness will be incurred in full, or at all. In this event, we may fund a portion of the Acquisition with
increased borrowings under the A/R Facility.

**The Offering**

_The summary below describes the principal terms of the notes (as defined below). Some of the terms and_
_conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. See “Description of Notes” for a_
_more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the notes and the indenture that will govern the notes._

**Issuer ................................................** Avantor Funding, Inc.

**Notes Offered ...................................** $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % senior notes due
2029.

**Maturity ...........................................**, 2029

**Interest ..............................................** Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of     % per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on      and       of each year,
commencing      , 2022. Interest will accrue from       , 2021.

**Guarantees .......................................** The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior basis by Holdings and each of Holdings’ existing
and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect domestic
restricted subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) to the extent such subsidiary
guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The guarantees of any guarantor will be automatically released in the
event such guarantor’s guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities is released (other than in connection with a refinancing or
repayment in full of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities). See
“Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**Ranking ............................................** The notes will be the Issuer’s and the guarantees will be the guarantors’
senior unsecured obligations and will:

                  - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and each
guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness, including
indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Existing Notes;

                  - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and each
guarantor’s future subordinated indebtedness and other obligations
that expressly provide for their subordination to the notes and the
guarantees;

                  - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including indebtedness
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured
Notes and any other existing and future secured indebtedness, to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and

                  - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness
and other liabilities of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer,
including indebtedness under the A/R Facility.


-----

As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the
Transactions:

                  - the notes and related guarantees would have ranked effectively
junior to approximately $4,709.3 million of secured indebtedness,
consisting primarily of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, the
Term Loan Financing, the Existing Secured Notes and the A/R
Facility;

                  - there would have been additional availability (i) under the Revolver
of up to $515.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of
credit) and (ii) under the A/R Facility of up to $200.0 million
(excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). The Issuer can also
incur additional secured indebtedness if certain specified conditions
are met under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and
the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby; and

                  - excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as
intercompany transactions, after giving effect to the Transactions,
the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for
approximately $3,185.3 million, or 45.2%, of its net sales for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and approximately $7,692.0
million, or 68.4%, of its total assets as of June 30, 2021, and would
have accounted for approximately $138.9 million, or 1.8%, of its
total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of June
30, 2021.

**Special Mandatory Redemption .....** In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion
of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special
mandatory redemption provisions. The consummation of the Acquisition
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. The “Initial Outside
Date” with respect to the notes shall be December 31, 2021, subject to
the extension to a date that is not later than February 28, 2022, or the
“Extended Outside Date.” The Initial Outside Date or the Extended
Outside Date, as applicable, are referred to herein as the “Outside Date.”
In the event that (a) the completion date of the Acquisition does not take
place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of
the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the
Initial Outside Date (or, if extended, the Extended Outside Date) or (c)
the Purchase Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Initial
Outside Date (or, if extended, the Extended Outside Date), the notes will
be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100% of the issue
price of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes from
the initial issue date to the redemption date, or the “special mandatory
redemption price.” See “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

**Optional Redemption ......................** The Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior
to       , 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes, if any,
to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole”


-----

premium, as described under the heading “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption.”

At any time on or after       , 2024, the Issuer may redeem some or
all of the notes at the redemption prices described under the heading
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Additionally, from time to time prior to       , 2024, the Issuer may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a
redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount of the notes
to be redeemed (i) with an amount equal to or less than the net cash
proceeds that we raise in one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

**Change of Control ...........................** Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control, we must
offer to repurchase the notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase
at the Option of the Holders—Change of Control.”

We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to
us at the time of a change of control, because:

                  - we may not have enough funds at that time; or

                  - the terms of our indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities may prevent us from making such payment.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—
The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of
Control required by the indenture that will govern the notes.”

**Certain Covenants ...........................** The indenture that will govern the notes will contain covenants that,
among other things, will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the
Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to:

                  - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

                  - incur liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

                  - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted
payments;

                  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

                  - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as
described under the heading “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

Many of these covenants will cease to apply to the notes during any time
that the notes have investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc., or “Moody’s,” and Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services, or “S&P,” and Fitch, Inc., or “Fitch,” and no default has

occurred and is continuing under the indenture that will govern the notes.
See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.”

The notes and the guarantees have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, and we are under no
obligation to so register the notes. The notes will be subject to
restrictions on transfer and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, except that holders will not be
permitted to transfer the notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the
applicable holding period has been satisfied. See “Transfer Restrictions.”
We do not intend to issue registered notes and guarantees in exchange for
the notes and the guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence
of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the
notes. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the
Notes—Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and
the Issuer does not currently intend to register the notes under applicable
securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell
the notes without registration under applicable securities laws.”


**No Prior Market ..............................** The notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market.
Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make
a market in the notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may
discontinue market making activities at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes will
develop or, if such a market develops, that it will be maintained.

**Listing ...............................................** The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated
quotation system.

**Denominations .................................** Minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof.

**Use of Proceeds ................................** We intend to use the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions, along
with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, to finance the
Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. However, to the extent
the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are not
met, the notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption. See “Use
of Proceeds,” “Risk Factors—If the Acquisition is not consummated by
the Outside Date or certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will
be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain
the return you expect on the notes” and “Description of Notes—Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data**

The following tables set forth our summary historical consolidated financial data as of the dates and for the
periods indicated. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2020 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 is derived from our
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum. The summary historical condensed consolidated financial data as of June 30, 2021 and for the six
months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 is derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial
statements and, in the opinion of our management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair
presentation of our consolidated results for these periods. The results for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily
indicative of the results expected for any future period.

We have also presented summary unaudited consolidated financial data for the twelve-month period ended
June 30, 2021, which does not comply with GAAP. This data has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited
statement of operations and cash flow data for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 from the audited statement
of operations and cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2020 and then adding the unaudited statement of
operations and cash flow data for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum. We have presented this financial data because we believe it provides our investors with
useful information to assess our recent performance.

You should read the information contained in this table in conjunction with “Capitalization” included in
this offering memorandum, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto in our Annual
Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in our Quarterly Reports, each of
which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

as discussed further below. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to
evaluate companies in our industry and is a helpful supplemental measure to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s
core operational performance as it excludes costs that do not relate to the underlying operation of their business.
We define Consolidated EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect items that are generally permitted in calculating
covenant compliance under the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and the credit agreements that governs the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. We describe these adjustments reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated EBITDA in the table below. We
believe Consolidated EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our
industry and is a helpful supplemental measure to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s performance as it further
includes cost savings that are expected to occur.
We define Adjusted Net Income as net income or loss exclusive of amortization as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of
certain costs related to the IPO, our reorganization and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing
operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors as a
way to analyze the underlying trends in our core business consistently across the periods inclusive of interest and depreciation.
We define Adjusted Net Leverage as gross debt, reduced by our cash and cash equivalents, divided by our trailing 12-month
Adjusted EBITDA (excluding stock-based compensation expense and including the run-rate effect of synergies). We believe
Adjusted Net Leverage is useful to investors as a way to evaluate and measure the Company’s capital allocation strategies and the
underlying trends in the business.
Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are non-GAAP measures of our
financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of financial performance, or
any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, nor should it be construed as an inference that our future results
will be unaffected by unusual or other items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and
Adjusted Net Leverage are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect
certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that
may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage contain
certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash
costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP
results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage. Our
presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage is not necessarily
comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or loss, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure, to
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, using data derived from our consolidated financial statements, in each case for the

(a) Represents amounts as determined under GAAP.
(b) Represents remeasurement of various foreign-denominated borrowings into functional currencies. Our U.S. subsidiaries carry a
significant amount of euro-denominated debt, and many of our subsidiaries borrow and lend with each other in foreign currencies.
Through July 11, 2019, the foreign currency losses were primarily caused by unhedged intercompany loans receivable ranging
from €190 million and €795 million.

On July 11, 2019, we completed an intercompany recapitalization that is intended to mitigate substantially all of our net euro
financing exposure in future periods. We still expect to record gains and losses related to intercompany borrowings denominated
in other currencies. Historically, the remeasurement of borrowings denominated in currencies other than the euro has not been
material.
(c) Represents expenses primarily related to remeasuring standalone appreciation rights at fair value on a recurring basis and the
vesting of performance stock options with the completion of our IPO.
(d) Represents the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, each incurred as a result of refinancing our outstanding
indebtedness or making significant prepayments on our term loans, and which were otherwise classified as interest expense in our
prior presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of a loss on extinguishment of debt of $73.7 million in 2019, we determined
it was appropriate to include this as an addition to Adjusted Net Income, and also to include the related 35% tax effect in the
income tax benefit applicable to pretax adjustments.

(f) Represents reversals of the short-term impact of purchase accounting adjustments on earnings. The most significant adjustment in
2019 was a normalization of expense for prepaid customer rebates that were derecognized in purchase accounting.
(g) Represents direct expenses incurred to consummate the VWR Acquisition and other expenses incurred related to the planning and
integration of VWR.
(h) Represents the accounting effects of tax reform legislation enacted in the United States. In 2018, we finalized our provisional
accounting for U.S. tax reform, which included interpreting new transition tax regulations issued in 2018. In connection with
finalizing our provisional accounting, we recognized an income tax benefit of $27.3 million, consisting of a $48.8 million benefit
related to the one-time transition tax, offset in part by an expense of $21.5 million related to deferred tax remeasurement. During
the preparation of our third quarter 2019 results, we concluded that it was more appropriate to remove the impact of these onetime benefits from U.S. tax reform in the calculation of Adjusted Net Income, and reclassify such impact as an increase to the
income tax benefit provision applicable to Adjusted Net Income. As a result, Adjusted Net Income for 2018 was reduced by
$27.3 million, but there were no changes to the amount of 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.

(k) Represents the income tax benefit associated with the reconciling items between net income or loss and Adjusted Net Income. To

determine the aggregate tax effect of the reconciling items, we utilized statutory income tax rates ranging from 0% and 35%,
depending upon the applicable jurisdictions of each adjustment.
(l) Represents the difference between income tax expense or benefit as determined under GAAP and the income tax benefit applicable
to pretax adjustments.

(a) Represents the Adjusted EBITDA of Avantor for the trailing twelve-month period plus management’s best estimates of the
incremental results attributable to acquired companies, derived entirely from financial information provided by the management of
the respective companies acquired in the relevant acquisition prior to our ownership and control of such companies, as if such
acquisitions had been completed on the first day of such trailing twelve-month period as permitted by our debt covenants. Such
estimates and financial information for acquired companies may or may not have been audited, require us to estimate the financial
results of these operations on a carved-out basis prior to our ownership, and in certain instances may have been prepared on a basis
other than U.S. GAAP though we believe these differences in the basis of accounting to be immaterial for the purpose of presenting
Adjusted EBITDA and other financial metrics, including Adjusted Net Leverage.

(b) Represents additional projected annualized cost synergies (above and beyond what is already included in our historical results)
that we believe would be generated as a result of the actions we have taken as of the periods presented in respect of the global value
capture program.

(3) Represents Consolidated EBITDA for the twelve months ended for each period shown.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with_
_the other information in this offering memorandum or incorporated by reference herein, including the risks and_
_uncertainties discussed under the section “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other_
_Data” included in this offering memorandum, the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the audited financial statements and the notes_
_thereto in our Annual Report and the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis_
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements_
_and related notes thereto in our Quarterly Reports, each of which is incorporated by reference herein, before_
_deciding to purchase any notes. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial condition,_
_results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, you may lose all or part_
_of your investment in the notes._

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_We may not be able to complete the Acquisition or the Term Loan Financing on or during the timeline expected,_**
**_or at all, or we may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition._**

On September 7, 2021, we announced that we entered into the Purchase Agreement to acquire the
Masterflex bioprocessing business and related assets of Antylia Scientific. We intend to use the net proceeds of the
Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, to finance the Acquisition
and to pay related fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Transactions will be consummated on the terms
contemplated, or at all, and this offering is not conditioned on the completion of the Acquisition or the Term Loan
Financing. In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then,
pending the consummation of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption
provisions. To the extent the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are not met, the notes will
be subject to special mandatory redemption. See “—If the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date or
certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not
obtain the return you expect on the notes” and “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.”

In addition, regardless of whether we close the Acquisition, the expected benefits of the Acquisition may
not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to potential complications with respect
to Masterflex’s integration; potential disruptions to Masterflex’s management or current or future plans and
operations due to the Acquisition; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise.
Failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition could adversely affect our financial condition and
operating results following the consummation of the Acquisition and many of these costs will be borne by us even if
the Acquisition is not consummated. In addition, if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our investment in
Masterflex were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value, the investment would be written down to
its fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

**_If the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date or certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will_**
**_be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes._**

If the Acquisition does not occur prior to the Outside Date or if certain other events that trigger special
mandatory redemption occur, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, as described under the
heading “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption,” and you may not obtain the return you expect to
receive on the notes.

**_We may be unable to redeem any or all of the notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption._**

The net proceeds from the offering relating to the notes will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory
redemption price with respect to the notes. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price
equal to 100% of the issue price of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes from the initial issue date


-----

to the redemption date. In the event of a special mandatory redemption, we will need to fund the balance of the
special mandatory redemption price from other sources of liquidity. In this event, we may not have sufficient funds
to purchase any or all of the notes, which would constitute an event of default under the indenture that will govern
the notes. “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_The Issuer has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect the Issuer’s financial_**
**_condition, and prevent the Issuer from fulfilling its obligations under the notes._**

After completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which
requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the
Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had
approximately $7,533.3 million of indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, including the notes offered hereby, and
estimated cash interest for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 would have been approximately $297.0 million.
On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would also have had an additional
$515.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and an
additional $200.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but
undrawn letters of credit).

The Issuer’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and to the holders
of the notes, including the following:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and or other debt;

    - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could further
adversely impact our cash flows;

    - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures,
investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business
opportunities and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;

    - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific
adverse economic conditions; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to
dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments,
acquisitions or other general corporate requirements.

The Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the
future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures that govern the
Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s
subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would
increase. See “Description of Notes.”

The Issuer’s ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under such debt
instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of the Issuer’s debt depends on, among


-----

other things, the Issuer’s operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of
which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The Issuer is not able to control
many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, the Issuer’s cash flow may not be sufficient
to allow the Issuer to pay principal and interest on its debt, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
and the Existing Notes, and meet its other obligations.

**_Due to many factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Issuer may_**
**_not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the_**
**_notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, and meet the Issuer’s other ongoing liquidity_**
**_needs, and it may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under its debt agreements,_**
**_which may not be successful._**

The Issuer’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. The
Issuer’s ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory
and other factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. The Issuer’s future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet such
obligations and commitments. If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to
service its indebtedness and to meet its other commitments, the Issuer will be required to adopt one or more
alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring the Issuer’s indebtedness (including the notes), selling material
assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy the Issuer’s
capital requirements. In addition, the Issuer’s existing or future debt agreements contain and will contain restrictive
covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The Issuer’s failure to comply with these
covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its
debts. See “Description of Notes.”

In addition, the Issuer conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which
will not be issuers or guarantors of the notes or its other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of such indebtedness,
including the notes, will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to
make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes,
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such other indebtedness, the subsidiaries will not have
any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such
other indebtedness, as applicable, or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be
able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the Issuer’s
indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal
and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from the Issuer’s subsidiaries. While the
indentures that govern the Existing Notes, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness limit, and the indenture that will govern the notes will
limit, the ability of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are, in the case of our existing debt,
and will be, in the case of the notes offered hereby, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that
the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make the required
principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes.

If the Issuer cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Issuer will be in default, and as a result,
holders of the notes and certain of its other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be
due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing
the borrowings under such agreements and the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which, in each
case, could result in your losing all or a portion of your investment in the notes.


-----

**_The notes and the related guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and_**
**_the guarantors’ indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and any of_**
**_their other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The notes and the related guarantees are not secured by any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ assets and
therefore are effectively subordinated to the claims of their respective secured debt holders (including, without
limitation, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the Existing Secured Notes) to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all
such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the Existing Secured Notes.

As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the aggregate amount of
the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries secured indebtedness would have been $4,709.3 million, and there would
have been $515.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) of availability under the Revolver and
$200.0 million of availability under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit), all of which
would have been effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In
addition, the Issuer is permitted to add incremental facilities under the credit agreement that governs the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and additional secured indebtedness, including additional Existing Secured Notes, under
the indentures governing the Existing Notes, in each case, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The
indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be
substantial and the holders of which will also be entitled to the remedies available to a secured lender. See
“Description of Notes.”

If the Issuer becomes insolvent or is liquidated, or if payment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or
under the Existing Secured Notes is accelerated, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will be entitled to
exercise the remedies available to a secured holder under applicable law (in addition to any remedies that may be
available under documents pertaining to such indebtedness). If an event of default occurs under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities or under the indenture that governs the Existing Secured Notes, the holders of such senior secured
indebtedness will have a prior right to the Issuer’s assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the notes, even if the
Issuer is in default with respect to the notes. In that event, the Issuer’s assets would first be used to repay in full all
indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes), resulting in all or a portion of the Issuer’s assets being unavailable
to satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any
distribution or payment of the Issuer’s assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization
or other bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding, holders of the notes will participate in the Issuer’s remaining
assets ratably with each other and with all holders of the Issuer’s unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the
same class as the notes, and potentially with all of the Issuer’s other general creditors, based upon the respective
amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, the Issuer cannot assure you that there will
be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than
holders of the Issuer’s secured indebtedness.

**_A significant portion of our net sales and assets are derived from entities that will not be guarantors of the notes._**
**_The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

From and after the consummation of this offering, the notes offered hereby will be guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by Holdings and all of Holdings’ existing and future domestic subsidiaries to the extent each such
subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, the guarantee of the notes by a subsidiary will
be automatically released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the
indentures that govern the Existing Notes permit, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will
permit, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, to incur certain additional
indebtedness, and will not limit their ability to incur trade payables and similar liabilities that are not considered
indebtedness thereunder.

You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.
Furthermore, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is liquidated, reorganized or


-----

dissolved, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors,
including trade creditors, banks and other lenders, followed by claims of any holders of preferred stock of such nonguarantor subsidiary. Only the residual equity value will be available to us and the Issuer’s guarantors, and only to
the extent the Issuer or any guarantor is a parent company of such non-guarantor subsidiary. Consequently, each
guarantee of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the
event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including
their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries,
are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made
available for distribution to us.

Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, after giving effect to
the Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for approximately $3,185.3 million, or
45.2%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and approximately $7,692.0 million, or 68.4%, of
its total assets as of June 30, 2021, and would have accounted for approximately $138.9 million, or 1.8%, of its total
gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2021.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in connection with a
sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that
will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such
guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a
refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee,
or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the
secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well. If the
guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary,
and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or
unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of
all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities have the discretion to release any guarantors under the_**
**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which could cause those guarantors to be released_**
**_from their guarantees of the notes._**

While any obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the
notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes, if the related guarantor is no longer a
guarantor of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any
other guarantor. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of
circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the notes,
and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those nonguarantor subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.

**_The credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures that govern the_**
**_Existing Notes restrict, and the indenture that will govern the notes will restrict, the Issuer’s current and future_**
**_operations, particularly the Issuer’s ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, and as a result, may_**
**_adversely affect the Issuer’s business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures that govern the
Existing Notes restrict contain, and the indenture that will govern the notes will contain, a number of covenants that,


-----

among other things, may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or
engage in other business activities that may be in the Issuer’s interest. The agreements governing the Issuer’s
indebtedness restrict or will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s
restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - make loans and investments;

    - sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

    - sell stock of the Issuer’s subsidiaries;

    - create or incur liens;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - enter into agreements restricting the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or to
incur liens on assets;

    - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the
lenders; and

    - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets.

In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a
result of these covenants and restrictions, the Issuer is and will be limited in how the Issuer conducts its business,
and the Issuer may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage
of new business opportunities. In addition, the Issuer will be required to maintain specified financial ratios and
satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness the Issuer may incur could include more
restrictive covenants. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants
in the future and, if the Issuer fails to do so, that the Issuer will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or
amend the covenants. Events beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, may affect our ability to
comply with our covenants.

The Issuer’s failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in
the Issuer’s future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or
waived, could result in the Issuer being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. If the Issuer is
forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, the Issuer’s
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_Reforms, including the phasing out of LIBOR after 2021, may adversely affect us._**

We have floating rate debt, the interest rate of which is determined based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”). LIBOR and other “benchmark” rates are subject to ongoing national and international regulatory
scrutiny and reform. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced
that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rates after 2021 (the
“FCA Announcement”). On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced in a public statement the future cessation of
quotations for tenors of overnight/Spot next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S.-dollar LIBOR. The
FCA’s announcements indicate that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. U.S.-dollar LIBOR is
expected to be replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference


-----

to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing
SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is
unknown whether any of these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR.
There is currently no definitive successor reference rate to LIBOR and various industry organizations are still
working to develop workable transition mechanisms. As part of this industry transition, we will be required to
migrate any current adjustable rate loans we service to any such successor reference rate. Until a successor rate is
determined, we cannot implement the transition away from LIBOR for the adjustable rate loans we service. As such,
we are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any alternative
reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United
States or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the
market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of
credit held by us. LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition. The
outcome of reforms may result in increased interest expense to us, affect our ability to incur debt on terms
acceptable to us and may result in increased costs related to amending our existing debt instruments, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes and the guarantees_**
**_relating to the notes, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the_**
**_notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees._**

The incurrence of indebtedness evidenced by the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review and
challenge under relevant state and federal fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer statutes in a bankruptcy or
reorganization case or a lawsuit by or on behalf of the Issuer’s creditors outside of bankruptcy. Under these statutes,
the notes and the guarantees could be avoided, or claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees could be
subordinated to all of the Issuer’s other indebtedness, if a court were to find at the time the Issuer or such guarantor
issued the notes or incurred a guarantee of the notes, that the Issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the note or incurring the guarantee, and:

    - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor;

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of such indebtedness;

    - was engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the
guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer or guarantor would incur, indebtedness beyond the
Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to repay such debts as they mature.

A court might also avoid the issuance of the notes or a guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the
court found that the Issuer issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the applicable guarantee with actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ respective creditors.

If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim
against us or the guarantors. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including
the remaining guarantors, if any. If a note or a guarantee is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer
or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a
creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or
found to be unenforceable. You may also be required to return payments you have received, as the court might direct
you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors with respect to such note and
guarantees.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor made at a time when the Issuer or
such guarantor is subsequently found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such
guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an
insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days to any non-insider party and such


-----

payment would give the holders of notes more than such holders of notes would have received in a liquidation under
Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, or the “Bankruptcy Code.”

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor
did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee if such guarantor did not
substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee. Thus, if the
guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was
incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable
guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance or transfer and preferences laws
will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding. Generally, however, the Issuer would be considered
insolvent if:

    - the sum of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of
all the Issuer’s assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of the Issuer’s assets were less than the amount that would be required to
pay the Issuer’s probable liability on existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature; or

    - the Issuer could not pay the Issuer’s debts as they become due.

The Issuer cannot assure you as to the standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a
court would agree with the Issuer’s conclusions in this regard that the Issuer and the guarantors will not be insolvent
or rendered insolvent by the issuance of the notes and the guarantees. Regardless of the actual standard applied by
the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee would not be avoided as a preference,
fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would
not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. The indenture that will govern the notes offered
hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum
amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer. The Issuer cannot assure you such a savings clause limitation, as a legal matter
will protect such guarantees from fraudulent conveyance or transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining
amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to
other claims against us under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (1) the holders
of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the
Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (3) equitable
subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control required by the indenture that will_**
**_govern the notes._**

Upon a Change of Control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right
to require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
of such notes, plus accrued interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding
notes, the Issuer may need to refinance the notes and/or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to
make the required repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, the Issuer could require
third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable
terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered
notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may


-----

cause the acceleration of the Issuer’s other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The
Issuer’s future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or
transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes.

The indentures governing the Existing Notes also contain similar change of control offer provisions. The
credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of
default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt
arrangements may contain similar provisions. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of
control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under such other indebtedness, the Issuer would probably
require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on
acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders
thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral, thereby limiting the Issuer’s ability to raise cash to
purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets._**

One of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. However, the phrase “all or substantially all” will likely be interpreted
under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a
degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s capital
stock or assets has occurred, in which case, the ability of a holder of the notes to obtain the benefit of an offer to
repurchase all of a portion of the notes held by such holder may be impaired. See “Description of Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders.”

**_The Issuer can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged_**
**_transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that
will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of the Issuer’s indebtedness or otherwise
adversely affect the Issuer’s capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, the Issuer could, in
the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, which would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but
that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital
structure or credit ratings.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and the Issuer does not currently intend to register_**
**_the notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes_**
**_without registration under applicable securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, and the Issuer does not currently intend to register the notes. The holders of the
notes will not be entitled to require the Issuer to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may
transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. As a result, you may be required to bear the
risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and the Issuer will_**
**_not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act_**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and the Issuer
will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will
not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.


-----

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. The Issuer
expects the notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under and pursuant to Rule
144A of the Securities Act or pursuant to Regulation S, but the Issuer does not intend to list the notes on any
national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial
purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws
and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced,
they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the
notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In
such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a
trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors,
some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, including:

    - the number of holders of notes;

    - the Issuer’s operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - prevailing interest rates; and

    - the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade indebtedness has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience
similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which
you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, the Issuer’s performance
and other factors.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The
Issuer is not obligated to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the notes in an exchange
offer registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they may be
transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and applicable state
securities laws.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the notes, if any, could cause_**
**_the liquidity or market value of the notes to decline._**

The notes have been rated by rating agencies. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the
notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances
relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in the Issuer’s business, so warrant. Any lowering or
withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could reduce the liquidity or market value of the notes.


-----

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will be suspended if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by two of the three rating agencies._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will no longer apply to us during any time
that the notes are rated investment grade by two of the three rating agencies, provided that at such time no default
under the relevant indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants restrict, among other things, the
Issuer’s ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance
that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will
maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that
would not be permitted while these covenants were in force and any action taken while these covenants are
suspended will not result in an event of default under the indenture on the basis that such actions would have been
prohibited by these covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.”

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the notes may be_**
**_less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the indenture._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of
the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal
to the sum of:

    - the original issue price of the notes; and

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that
does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal
amount thereof stated in the indenture.

**_Holders of the notes may not be able to effect service of process or enforce judgments obtained against us outside_**
**_of the United States._**

We are organized under the laws of the United States. A substantial portion of our assets are located in the
United States and, as a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process or enforce judgments
obtained against us outside the United States.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from this offering of the notes will be approximately $800.0 million.
We intend to use the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under
our A/R Facility, to finance the Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses.

However, to the extent the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are not met, the
notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—If the Acquisition is not consummated
by the Outside Date or certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will be required to redeem the notes, which
means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes” and “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

(1) As adjusted amount assumes approximately $200.0 million of cash generated during the third quarter of 2021 is used to fund the

Acquisition. As adjusted amount may further increase or decrease depending on, among other things, actual costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, including any purchase price adjustments. In addition, as described in this offering
memorandum, we intend to fund the Acquisition with the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand
and borrowings under our A/R Facility, as reflected on an as adjusted basis. However, the consummation of this offering and the
Term Loan Financing will be dependent on the market and other factors, and there is no assurance that this offering and the Term
Loan Financing will be incurred in full, or at all. In this event, we may fund a portion of the Acquisition with increased cash from
the balance sheet.


-----

(2) As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $515.0 million of availability under the Revolver (excluding $1.6 million of undrawn letters

of credit). In addition, as described in this offering memorandum, we intend to fund the Acquisition with the net proceeds from the
Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, and we do not currently intend to draw on
the Revolver. However, the consummation of this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be dependent on the market and other
factors, and there is no assurance that this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be incurred in full, or at all. In this event, we
may fund a portion of the Acquisition with borrowings under the Revolver.
(3) On an actual basis, as of June 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under our A/R Facility and we would have had

$300.0 million of available borrowings thereunder (excluding $ 8.8 million of undrawn letters of credit). In addition, as described in
this offering memorandum, we intend to fund the Acquisition with the net proceeds from the Financing Transactions, along with
cash on hand and $100.0 million of borrowings under our A/R Facility, as reflected on an as adjusted basis. However, the
consummation of this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be dependent on the market and other factors, and there is no
assurance that this offering and the Term Loan Financing will be incurred in full, or at all. In this event, we may fund a portion of
the Acquisition with increased borrowings under the A/R Facility.
(4) Reflects the U.S. dollar equivalent of the €1,114.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Euro Term Loan Facility.

Represents an exchange rate of $1.185 to €1.00, determined as of June 30, 2021.
(5) The full amount of the Term Loan Financing will be drawn on the closing date of the Acquisition. The amounts shown above do not

give effect to the unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs. The amount shown also excludes any original issue discount
that may be incurred, which would be amortized and included as interest expense in our statement of income and comprehensive
income over the life of the term loan. In addition, if the aggregate net proceeds from this offering is less than anticipated, we
currently intend to incur an increased amount of indebtedness in the Term Loan Financing prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition.
(6) Reflects the U.S. dollar equivalent of the €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028.

Represents an exchange rate of $1.185 to €1.00, determined as of June 30, 2021.
(7) Reflects the U.S. dollar equivalent of the €650.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.625% Senior First Lien Notes due

2025.
(8) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the notes offered hereby, excluding initial purchasers’ discounts and debt issuance

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

The Issuer will issue $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of       % senior notes due 2029 (the
“Notes”) pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among the Issuer, the
Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Indenture will
not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

If the closing of this offering of the Notes and the Issue Date occur prior to the date of the closing of the
Acquisition (the “Acquisition Date”), then the Notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption
provisions. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, the Notes will be redeemed at a
price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the
Guarantees, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, including the definitions of certain terms used therein. We urge you to
read each of these documents because they, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders. You may
request copies of the Indenture and the Notes at our address set forth under the heading “Summary.”

In this section of the Offering Memorandum, references to the “Issuer” are to Avantor Funding, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries.

**Brief Description of Notes**

The Notes will be:

    - general senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including the_
Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Notes) of the Issuer;

    - effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including the Senior
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such Indebtedness;

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities,
including Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Subsidiary Guarantors,
including the A/R Facility; and

    - guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings and each Domestic Subsidiary that is a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Issuer) that incurs or guarantees any
Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities.

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, Holdings and each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Holdings
(other than the Issuer) that is a borrower or guarantor of any Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, as a
primary obligor and not merely as surety, will jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior
unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or


-----

otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, whether for payment of principal of,
premium on, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the
Indenture by executing the Indenture.

As further described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” each Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Issuer) that
incurs or guarantees any Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or certain future Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any other Guarantor (and any Domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary if such nonWholly-Owned Subsidiary guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities or certain other capital markets debt securities of
the Issuer or any other Guarantor) will, subject to certain exceptions and to release as provided below or elsewhere
in this “Description of Notes,” guarantee the Notes.

The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be:

    - a general senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor;

    - senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor_
(including its guarantee of all Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing
Senior Notes);

    - effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including its guarantee of
all Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes) of such
Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other claims and liabilities,
including Preferred Stock of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Subsidiary
Guarantors, including the A/R Facility.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and the Guarantees provided may be released
in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—The notes and the
note guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries.” In the
event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of
their assets to the Issuer or any other Guarantor.

Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, on an as-adjusted
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for
approximately $3,185.3 million, or 45.2%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and
approximately $7,692.0 million, or 68.4%, of its total assets as of June 30, 2021, and would have accounted for
approximately $138.9 million, or 1.8%, of its total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of June
30, 2021.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and, therefore, are limited to the amount
that such Guarantor could guarantee without such Guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance; this limitation,
however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. If a Guarantee
were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other
contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a


-----

Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or
the note guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

**_Release of Guarantees_**

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that its Obligations under the Indenture and such
Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other
disposition (by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital
Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable
Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof);

(b) (i) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor
with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities or (ii) the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct
obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee except, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii), a
discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being
understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release);

(c) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture;

(d) the Issuer exercising its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the
Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(e) the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division of any Subsidiary
Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division, or upon the liquidation of such Subsidiary
Guarantor; or

(f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that such Guarantee will not be
released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with respect to any
Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities or the Existing Senior Notes.

**Ranking**

The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and the payment of any
Guarantee will be unsecured and the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment
with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, including the
Obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Notes. The
Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment
to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ Secured Indebtedness, including the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness. The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a particular
Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.

A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer, including trade creditors and creditors holding
Indebtedness or guarantees issued by such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders of such


-----

non-guarantor Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such non-guarantor
Subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including Holders, even if such claims do not constitute Senior
Indebtedness. Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred stockholders, if any, of such non-guarantor Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to
the Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the
Guarantors would have had:

(1) $4,536.9 million of Secured Indebtedness, consisting of Secured Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes (excluding $72.4 million of our Financing Lease
Obligations), with $515.0 million of unused availability under our revolving credit facility (excluding
issued but undrawn letters of credit), all of which would be effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby;
and

(2) $2,824.0 million of unsecured Senior Indebtedness (including the Notes).

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be
substantial. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” In addition, although the Indenture will limit the incurrence
of Indebtedness by, and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of, the Restricted Subsidiaries, such
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and the Indebtedness incurred and
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial. See “Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”
Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence or issuance by such Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes
will be the Trustee. The paying agent will make payments on the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars with respect to the Notes. The initial registrar for the
Notes will be the Trustee. The registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from
time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions set forth in
the section of the Offering Memorandum entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The registrar and the Trustee may require
a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders
will be required to pay all taxes and fees required by law and due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to
transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender offer.
Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 10 days before delivering a
notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**


-----

The Issuer will issue $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will
mature on        , 2029. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the
Issuer may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Indenture. The
Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
_provided, however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the Notes and the_
Additional Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture, the Guarantees and this “Description of Notes” include any
Additional Notes that are actually issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of         % per annum, and will be payable in cash semiannually in arrears on          and         , commencing on         , 2022, to the Holders of record as of
the close of business (if applicable) on the immediately preceding          and          (whether or not a
Business Day). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly
provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the
Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The Notes will be issued
in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the paying
agent maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” or, at the option
of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set forth
in the register of Holders or by wire transfer; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest
with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its
nominee will be made in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer,
the Issuer’s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment
date, the maturity date or any earlier required repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a Legal Holiday,
the required payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest on such payment will
accrue in respect of the delay.

**Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the closing of this offering of Notes and the Issue Date occur prior to the Acquisition Date, the Notes will
be subject to the provisions hereof. In the event that (a) the Acquisition does not take place on or prior to the Outside
Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the
Outside Date or (c) the Masterflex Purchase Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Outside Date (the
date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate_
issue price of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption (“Special Mandatory Notice”) will be delivered by the Issuer,
no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the paying agent, and
will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the third Business Day after such notice
is given by the Issuer (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the
Issuer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the paying Agent for payment to each Holder of the Notes the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes.

The net proceeds of the offering of Notes will not be sufficient to fund any accrued and unpaid interest
owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event of a
Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will pay, an amount of cash in dollars sufficient to fund the balance of
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, including accrued and unpaid interest owing to the Holders. On the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Issuer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the paying agent for payment to
each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes.


-----

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as set forth under “—Special Mandatory Redemption” above, the Issuer will not be required to
make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase
at the Option of Holders.” The Issuer, the Investors and their respective Affiliates may, at their discretion, at any
time and from time to time, acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market
purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below or in the circumstances set forth in the ninth paragraph under “—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior
to         , 2024.

At any time prior to         , 2024, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem
all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any
applicable date of redemption hereunder, the “Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the
Redemption Date.

On and after         , 2024, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on          of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2024 ..................................................................................................................... %
2025 ..................................................................................................................... %
2026 and thereafter .............................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, until          , 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice as described under the
heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture at a
redemption price (as calculated by the Issuer) equal to (x)           % of the aggregate principal amount thereof,
with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings to the extent such net
cash proceeds are received by or contributed to the Issuer plus (y) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but
excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date; provided that
(a) at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the
Issue Date (but excluding any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date) remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption and (b) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of
the date of closing of each such Equity Offering.

The Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in the manner described under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Selection and Notice.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of not less than
90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the


-----

Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such repurchase date, to
redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or repurchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be
less than par and shall exclude any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest
paid to any Holder in such tender offer payment) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the
right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, unless, prior to, or
concurrently with, the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below), the Issuer
has previously or concurrently mailed or delivered, or otherwise sent through electronic transmission, a redemption
notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and
Discharge,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the
“Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof (or such
higher amount as the Issuer may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”))
(such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below). Within 30 days
following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following
information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to
such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided that the
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in the Issuer’s discretion, until such time (including
more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8)
below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the
reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC to the paying
agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that, until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent
(or such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the
“withdrawal deadline”), that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to


-----

require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the
withdrawal deadline, an electronic transmission (in PDF), a telegram, a facsimile transmission or letter or
otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal
amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes
and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be
issued new Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that
the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion
of the Notes surrendered; provided that the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least
$2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000;

(8) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other
conditions specified therein and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the
Issuer’s discretion (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered), the Change of
Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or
waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer
shall determine that any or all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will
not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment
Date as so delayed; and

(9) such other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a
Holder must follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of Notes through the
facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under
the Indenture). In addition, the Existing Senior Notes contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions
described in this “—Change of Control” section. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default
under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the
Existing Senior Notes, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities, the


-----

Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the
Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements, such default or failure to
repurchase any tendered Existing Senior Notes could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit
Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by
our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may
not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under the indenture that
will govern the notes offered hereby and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.”

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.
The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We
currently have no intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we
could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time
or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness
are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party approved in writing by
the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such
Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by
the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, provided that such notice is given not more than 60 days following such
purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or
purchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the
“Second Change _of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment (excluding_
any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest to any Holder in such Change of
Control Payment) in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in
the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change
of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As
a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.


-----

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer with
respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or
modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may
be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the
Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the offer to purchase a Holder’s Notes in the tender offer is
not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in
writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate
Offer) may increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender premium or
similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control
Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued
and unpaid interest thereon.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (measured at the time of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such
Asset Sale (measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together with all other Asset
Sales since November 21, 2017 (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(i) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as
reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence, accrual or
increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith
by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their
terms subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees, that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset
Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from
such liabilities;

(ii) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or
Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180
days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(iii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (with the fair
market value of such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (iii) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed 2.0% of the Total Assets at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale,

shall, for purposes of the paragraphs under this caption “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales” (and no other provision of the Indenture), be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents.


-----

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds
_Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the_
Applicable Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”),

(i) to repay:

(w) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred
under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (and in
the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto);

(x) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (and in the
case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto);

(y) Obligations under the Notes or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of other Senior
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect thereto,
if applicable); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so repay any
Senior Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer will either (1) reduce Obligations under
the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (A) redeeming Notes as described under “—
Optional Redemption” or (B) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in arm’slength privately negotiated transactions (which, in each case, may be below par), or (2) make
an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all
Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no
less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest, if any, thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased (which offer
shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or

(z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, other
than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such
Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of
such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital
expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other property or assets (other than Capital Stock), in the case
of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), either (A) that is used or useful in a Similar Business or (B) that
replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(iii) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, in the case of clause (ii) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such
Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration
of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Applicable Proceeds are
actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the
period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the “First Commitment Application Period”), and, in
the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the expiration of the
Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith,
then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
reasonably expects to enter into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the First Commitment
Application Period (a “Second Commitment”) and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such manner
prior to 180 days from the expiration of the First Commitment Application Period (the period from the
consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the “Second Commitment Application Period”); provided, further, that
if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Applicable Proceeds are


-----

applied or if such Second Commitment is not entered into prior to the expiration of the First Commitment
Application Period, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Second
Commitment Application Period has expired.

To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million (the “Excess
_Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of_
other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders
of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is
equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if
applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within twenty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds
exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by transmitting electronically or mailing the notice required pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to
such Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale
Proceeds Application Period (the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds
(the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if
applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in
the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (such remaining proceeds, the “Declined Proceeds”) in any manner
not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the
Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee or applicable depositary shall select the Notes (subject
to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the
accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered, with
adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an
unauthorized denomination; provided that no Notes of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion
of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are
any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion
shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of
any Advance Offer, any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may
use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the
holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness
outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such
Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Asset Sale provisions described in the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be


-----

made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the
Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees.

The Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Existing Senior Notes limit, and future credit
agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a
party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event
the Issuer is contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may
be, may seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or
repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the
Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture, selection of
the Notes for redemption or purchase will be made in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC; provided that
no Notes of less than $2,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part.

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically, in accordance with DTC procedures in
the case of global notes, or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days (or such shorter period as is
specified solely in respect of any Special Mandatory Redemption) but except as set forth in the sixth paragraph
under “—Optional Redemption,” not more than 60 days before the purchase date or Redemption Date to each
Holder at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that
redemption notices may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued
in connection with a defeasance of the Notes, a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the next
paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part only, any notice of redemption or purchase that relates
to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed or purchased.

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given in
connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a
Change of Control and prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may,
at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or
occurrence of the related Equity Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or
purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Redemption Date or purchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was
mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived,
or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Redemption Date or purchase date or by the Redemption
Date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if
in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the
Issuer may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person. In no
event shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate
amount of the Notes eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed.

With respect to any certificated notes, if any Notes are to be purchased or redeemed in part only, the Issuer
will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the original Note in
the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note; provided that the new Notes will be only
issued in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for redemption
or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is
conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the purchase date or Redemption Date, unless the
Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase or redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of
them called for purchase or redemption, unless such redemption or purchase remains conditioned on the occurrence
of a future event.


-----

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions.
Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different Redemption
Dates and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such
redemptions are deemed to occur.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Covenant Suspension_**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants to be contained in the Indenture. If on any date
following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of three Rating Agencies and (ii) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), then
beginning on such date and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock;”

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(7) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.”

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the “Suspension
_Date”), the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sale shall be reset at zero. In the event that the Issuer and the_
Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the
foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or more of the applicable Rating Agencies
withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade
Rating such that the Notes no longer have Investment Grade Ratings from at least two of three Rating Agencies,
then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with
respect to future events.

The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but excluding the
Reversion Date) is referred to in this “Description of Notes” as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the
Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken
or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to
a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments made on or after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be
calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in
effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Acquisition or
Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period), (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued during the Suspension
Period in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph
of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (3) no


-----

Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during any Suspension Period, (4) any Affiliate
Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension
Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (5) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries,” (6) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to
any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period, (7) all Liens created, incurred or
assumed during the Suspension Period in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” (8)
all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition
Acquisition or Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been
made pursuant to clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” and (9) on the Reversion Date, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to
the extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such
covenant and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be
interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension
Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other
covenant).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any
actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time
based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to
honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension
Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant
Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if
such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension
Period on the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the
Holders of the Notes of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the
Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity
Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or
distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to
purchase such Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock); or


-----

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the
case of any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of
securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer,
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment
or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of
the Issuer or any Parent Entity, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, in
each case held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease, discharge or otherwise
acquire or retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or
maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clauses (7), (8) or (9) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” or

(b) the prepayment, redemption, defeasance, purchase, repurchase, discharge or
other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the
date of prepayment, redemption, defeasance, purchase, repurchase, discharge or acquisition or
retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto)
being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and, in the case of a
Restricted Investment, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of
“—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof;

(2) except in the case of (i) a Restricted Investment and (ii) amounts attributable to
subclauses (b) through (f) of clause (3) below, immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro
forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after November 21, 2017 (including Restricted
Payments permitted by clauses (1) and (6)(c) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other
Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without
duplication):

clauses (10) and (16), there is no continuous Event of Default under clauses (1), (2) or (6) under “Events of Default
and Remedies.”

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted
Payments described in the preceding clauses (1) through (21) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in
the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole
discretion) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (21) and
such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in a


-----

manner that otherwise complies with this covenant. In the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or
Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified under clause (16) above or clause
(29) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” (such clauses, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the
amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that may be made pursuant to the Incurrence Clauses
shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially concurrent incurrence of Indebtedness to finance
any other portion of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment or any other Restricted Payment or Permitted
Investment divided, classified or reclassified under the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the
preceding clauses or one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments” other than an Incurrence
Clause.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the fair market value on the Transaction
Test Date, in the case of a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, or the date of the Restricted
Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not
permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence of
the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in
the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount
determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted
only if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether
pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment”
with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise
(collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may
incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), and issue shares of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, if either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the
Applicable Measurement Period would have been equal to or less than 6.90 to 1.00, in each case, determined on a
pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness
had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the
application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such Applicable Measurement Period; provided,
_further, that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue_
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the greater of (x) $550.0 million and
(y) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement Period of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors incurred
pursuant to this paragraph, together with amounts incurred under clause (14)(x) of the next paragraph by Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, would be outstanding at such time.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (32) of the preceding paragraph or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may
divide, classify or reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or portion
thereof) in one of the above clauses or paragraphs; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facilities on the Issue Date, and any refinancing thereof, will at all times be treated as
incurred and outstanding under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph and may not be reclassified;

(2) at the time of incurrence, the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of
Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs
above; and

(3) the principal amount of Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock outstanding under any clause of this covenant shall be determined after giving effect to
the application of proceeds of any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock to refinance
any such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for
purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon
a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time,
then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1)
so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not
exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts
permitted by the next sentence. Any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (4) and (12) of the second


-----

paragraph of this covenant shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance
costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or
liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated by the Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was deemed to be incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the
case of revolving credit debt, for purposes of this covenant; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a
foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not
exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including upfront
fees, original issue discount or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of any
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being
refinanced, shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in
which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the
date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other
Indebtedness solely because such Indebtedness has a junior priority with respect to shared collateral or because it is
secured by sufficient collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or
assume any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness
or any related guarantee of Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless
the Notes (or the related Guarantee in the case of Liens on assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor) are secured equally and
ratably with (or, at the Issuer’s option or if such Subject Lien secures Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior basis
to) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by its
terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In addition, in the event that a Subject Lien
is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release
and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such
Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of


-----

original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Issuer will not merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division
as the Dividing Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of (including, in each case, by way of Division) all or substantially all of the properties or assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person
unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, winding up or Division (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person organized or
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the laws of the United States, any
state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called
the “Successor Company”); provided that in the case where the Successor Company is not a corporation, a
corporation becomes a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, expressly assumes all the Obligations of
the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, in each case, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other
documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period,

(a) the Successor Company or the Issuer would be permitted to incur at least $1.00
of additional Indebtedness under either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test or the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio test described in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock,” or

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer (or the Successor
Company, as applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the Applicable
Measurement Period immediately prior to such transaction, or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio for the Issuer (or the Successor Company, as applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would be equal to or less than the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Division, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and such supplemental
indentures or other documents or instruments, if any, comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes
and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4),

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with, wind up or into or
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and


-----

(2) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up, or consummate a
Division as the Dividing Person with an Affiliate of the Issuer, solely for the purpose of reincorporating the
Issuer in the United States or any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia.

Subject to the provisions described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee, no Subsidiary
Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit a Subsidiary Guarantor to, merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or
into or wind up into or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person (whether or not the Issuer or a Guarantor is
the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose (including, in each case, by way of
Division) of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person
unless:

(1) (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or
surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, winding up or Division (if other than such
Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition
will have been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of
such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States or any state or territory
thereof or the District of Columbia (such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being
herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor, if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor, expressly
assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary
Guarantor’s related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or
instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; or

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor only, the transaction is not prohibited by the
covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee and such
Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and
such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (i) merge,
consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or
the Issuer, (ii) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or consummate a Division as the
Dividing Person with or into the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing the Subsidiary Guarantor in the United States or any state or territory thereof or the District of
Columbia, (iii) convert into a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such
Subsidiary Guarantor or a jurisdiction in the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia,
(iv) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets comprising of
Equity Interest of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to the Issuer or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or
(v) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the Board of the Issuer or
the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer) determines in good faith that such action is
in the best interests of the Issuer and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders, in each case, without regard
to the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything in this “Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets” covenant, the consummation of the Transactions (including, without limitation, the Acquisition) will be
permitted under the Indenture.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or


-----

enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or
for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $110.0 million and (y) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for
the Applicable Measurement Period, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’slength basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no comparable transaction is available with
which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such transaction is taken in its entirety;
and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of
(x) $165.0 million and (y) 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement
Period, a resolution adopted by the Board of the Issuer approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in
an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such transaction and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of the Issuer into any Parent Entity;
_provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash,_
Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise consummated in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business
purpose;

the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (13)(f) of the third

permitted transferee) of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, including in
connection with the VWR Transaction;

(5) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not
materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than
those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect or contemplated as of the Issue Date (other
than any agreement or arrangement of the type described in clause (3) above), or any amendment thereto
(so long as any such amendment is not materially disadvantageous in the good faith judgment of the Board


-----

of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer) to the Holders
when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date);

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
its obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement or the equivalent (including any registration
rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any Parent Entity) is a party on the
Issue Date and any similar agreements which it (or any Parent Entity) may enter into thereafter; provided,
_however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or_
such Parent Entity) of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any
similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent
that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise materially disadvantageous in
the good faith judgment of the Board of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent
Entity of the Issuer) to the Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in
effect on the Issue Date;

(8) the VWR Transaction, the Transactions and the payment of all fees and expenses related

are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Board of the
Issuer or the senior management thereof (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer), or are on terms, taken as a
whole, that are not materially less favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

Issuer and the granting and performing of customary registration rights to any Parent Entity or to any
Permitted Holder or to any former, current or future director, manager, officer, member, partner, employee

-----

connection therewith) so long as the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or
more favorable terms and (B) payments to Permitted Holders in respect of securities or loans of the Issuer

(17) intellectual property licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice;

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors

other transaction entered into in connection with any such acquisition, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or redesignation, in existence at the time of such acquisition or at the time it
merges, consolidates or amalgamates with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or

Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries;

(n) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be
incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred

materially impair the Issuer’s ability to make payments under the Notes when due, (B) the
encumbrances and restrictions in such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock apply
only during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant
relating to such Indebtedness or (C) the encumbrances and restrictions in such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock either are not materially more restrictive taken as a whole
than those contained in the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes or the Notes as in
effect on the Issue Date or generally represent market terms at the time of incurrence or issuance

contracts restricting the assignment or other transfer thereof (or the assets subject thereto),

restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in
the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more restrictive with respect to such
encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common
stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination
of loans and advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**


-----

The Issuer will not permit any Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (and any Domestic
Subsidiary that is a non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary guarantees the Senior
Credit Facilities or other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a direct or
indirect Domestic Subsidiary of a direct or indirect Subsidiary that is CFC, a FSHCO, a Guarantor or a Receivables
Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) any Credit
Facility permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (iii) capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any other Guarantor

delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Subsidiary; provided that this
covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—
Guarantees.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders:

(1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements substantially in forms that would be
required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q of the Issuer, if the Issuer were
required to file such forms, plus a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” (y) with respect to the annual and quarterly information, a presentation of Adjusted
EBITDA of the Issuer substantially consistent with the presentation thereof in the Offering Memorandum
and derived from such financial information, and (z) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a
report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm; and

(2) within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported,
such other information containing substantially the same information that would be required to be
contained in filings with the SEC on Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02,
5.01 and 5.02(b) and (c) (other than with respect to information otherwise required or contemplated by
Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) as in effect on the Issue Date if the Issuer were
required to file such reports; provided, however, that no such current report will be required to include as an
exhibit, or to include a summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement,
plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, member, partner,
manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries);

_provided, however, that (i) in no event shall such financial statements or reports be required to comply with (x) Rule_
3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (or such other rule or regulation that amends, supplements or
replaces such Rule 3-10, including for the avoidance of doubt, Rules 13-01 or 13-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated
by the SEC), (x) Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X (or such other rule or regulation that amends, supplements or replaces

of any of Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, Affiliates or equity method investees, (ii) in no event shall
such financial statements or reports be required to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein,
(iii) in no event shall such financial statements or reports be required to include any information that is not otherwise
similar to information currently included in the Offering Memorandum, other than with respect to reports provided
under clause (2) above, (iv) no such reports referenced under clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the
Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to the Holders or the business, assets,
operations or financial position of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (v) in no event
shall reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial
statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K except for
(x) agreements evidencing material Indebtedness and (y) historical and pro forma financial information to the extent


-----

reasonably available and, in any case with respect to such pro forma financial information, such pro forma financial
information shall include only pro forma revenues, Consolidated EBITDA and capital expenditures in lieu thereof.

All such annual reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they
relate, and all such quarterly reports shall be furnished within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which
they relate.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and if any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph
will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either (i) on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, (ii) in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” or (iii) in
any other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer.

The Issuer will make available such information and such reports (as well as the details regarding the
conference call described below) to any Holder and, upon request, to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case
by posting such information on its website, on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system
which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available to any
Holder, any bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of
investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such information as confidential or
accesses such information on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system which will
require a confidentiality acknowledgment; provided that the Issuer shall post such information thereon and make
readily available any password or other login information to any such Holder, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker; provided, further, however, that the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any such Holder,
prospective investor, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the
extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of such information to such Person would be
competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, bona fide
prospective investors, security analysts or market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the information
contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for
any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such
reports (and the information contained therein).

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer (or a Parent Entity) will also:

(1) as promptly as reasonably practicable after furnishing to the Trustee each annual and
quarterly report required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this “Reports and Other Information”
covenant or such earlier time after the completion of such reporting period, hold a conference call to
discuss the results of operations for the relevant reporting period (which conference call, for the avoidance
of doubt, may be held prior to such time that the annual or quarterly financial statements required by the
first paragraph of this “Reports and Other Information” covenant for such reporting period are furnished to
Holders so long as an earnings release for the applicable period has been furnished or otherwise made
available to the Holders prior to the conference call) and may be the same as any call for the Issuer’s or any
Parent Entity’s equity holders; and

(2) issue a press release to the appropriate nationally recognized wire services prior to the
date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this paragraph, announcing
the time and date of such conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or
informing Holders, beneficial owners, prospective investors, market makers and securities analysts how
they can obtain such information.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors,
upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so
long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.


-----

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this “Reports and Other Information”
covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial and other information
relating to any Parent Entity instead of the Issuer; provided that to the extent such Parent Entity holds assets (other
than its direct or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the lesser of (i) 1.0% of revenues of such Parent Entity
and (ii) 1.0% of the total revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Entity, then such information related to
such Parent Entity shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that explains in
reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the information
relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other information referred to in
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has filed reports
containing such information (or any such information of a Parent Entity in accordance with the immediately
preceding paragraph) with the SEC.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “Reports and
Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been
cured.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following events is an “Event of Default” with respect to the
Notes under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written
notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the
Notes; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—
Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days
after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given; provided, further, that no such notice may
be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to the Holders, more than two years
prior to such notice;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of any Subsidiary Guarantor (other
than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Permitted Receivables Financing),
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or
relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is


-----

in the aggregate, in excess of $300.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) at any one time
outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $300.0 million (or its
foreign currency equivalent) (to the extent not covered by insurance as to which the insurer has been
notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final judgments remain unpaid,
undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and, in the
event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any
creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “Certain
Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); or

(7) the Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements
of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and
effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture) or be declared null and void or any
responsible officer of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers
of any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “Certain Covenants—
Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in
writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than
by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or
the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under
the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding
Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then
outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable
immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first
paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without
further action or notice. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must
send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide
that the Trustee shall not have knowledge or notice of an Event of Default, unless it shall have received written
notice thereof. The Indenture will provide further that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any
continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to
accelerate the Notes if in the judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing
Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of
Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting
Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes; provided such rescission would
not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in
clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default,
other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and
without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:


-----

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; or

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have
requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes
have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to a responsible officer of the Trustee to provide
a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one
or more Holders of the Notes, other than a Regulated Bank (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a
written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and a responsible officer of the Trustee that such Holder
is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder
Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time
of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the
beneficial owner of such Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time,
in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at


-----

such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed
pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following
the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with
respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the
percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the
effect that such Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration
voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such
Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction,
Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it in accordance
with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to
it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated Banks, Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no
liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any
Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether any Holder has
delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other
agreement, or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within fifteen Business Days, upon becoming
aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers,**
**Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or
stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies or entities shall have any liability for
any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that
such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes or the Guarantees, as
the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the
Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations
discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee
(“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:


-----

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture,
the Notes and its Guarantee, as applicable (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with
such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events
pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such
amounts (including scheduled payments thereon) as will be sufficient (without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest), in the opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the Redemption Date, as
the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify
whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular Redemption Date; provided that, upon
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date
of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the
Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium
Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had
not occurred;


-----

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions
and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had
not occurred;

(4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case the
granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which, the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than
that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous
deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance,
as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore
been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due
and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, (ii) will become due and
payable within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and
at the expense, of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Guarantor have irrevocably deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars,
Government Securities or a combination thereof, in such amounts (including scheduled payments thereon)
as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium,
if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided that, upon any redemption that
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of
the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to
be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall
be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption;

(b) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make
such deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each


-----

case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) with respect to the Indenture or the Notes shall
have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such
deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under
any material agreement or material instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or
any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that
resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and
simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in
connection therewith);

(c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of
Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee stating that all conditions
precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee may
be amended or supplemented and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee may be waived, in each case, with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the
Issuer or its Affiliates, including consents or waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment, supplement or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note (other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Sales) or reduce the premium payable upon the
redemption of such Notes or change the time at which such Notes may be redeemed as described under “—
Optional Redemption;” provided that any amendment to the minimum notice requirement may be made
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee
which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;


-----

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or any Note of any Holder
to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of any Note or related Guarantee that would
adversely affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Significant
Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to its Guarantee or the Indenture to
which it is a party), and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee without
the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to
alter the provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including the related definitions) in a
manner that does not materially adversely affect any Holder;

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;”

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the Notes;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in any material
respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

(8) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, if applicable;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee or any successor paying agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(10) to add a Guarantor, a guarantee of a Parent Entity, or a co-obligor of the Notes under the
Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees to any provision of this
“Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance
and administration of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees;


-----

(14) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or
required by the Indenture;

(15) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted by the Indenture
(including pursuant to the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Liens”); and

(16) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture or the Notes to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the Indenture provisions
described under “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) will be deemed given on the first date on
which publication is made, notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar
days after mailing or transmitting, notices sent by overnight delivery service will be deemed given when delivered
and notices given electronically will be deemed given when sent. Notice given in accordance with the procedures of
DTC will be deemed given on the date sent to DTC.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions;
however, if it acquires any conflicting interest (as defined in the Indenture) it must eliminate such conflict within 90
days or resign as Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that at all
times that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Indenture, and use the same degree of care of and skill in their exercise as a prudent
person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee will be
under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless
such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense with respect to such exercise.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York.

**Limited Condition Acquisition and Specified Transaction**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture (including the absence of defaults of Events of Default), in each case
in connection with (a) any Limited Condition Acquisition, (b) any incurrence or issuance of or repayment,
redemption, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, (c) the creation of
Liens, (d) the making of any Asset Sale or any disposition excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”, or (e) the
making of an Investment (including any acquisition) (the transactions referred to in clauses (b) through (e),
collectively, the “Specified Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”) and any actions or transactions
related thereto, the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial metric or whether the Limited Condition
Acquisition or any such Specified Transaction is permitted (or any requirement or conditions therefor is complied
with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default)) may, at the option of the Issuer,


-----

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Entity of the Issuer, any successor entity of any of the foregoing
(including a third party) (the “Testing Party”) (which election may be made on or prior to the date of consummation
of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction), be the date the definitive agreements for such
Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a
binding offer or launch of a “certain funds” tender offer), the date of the announcement of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or Specified Transaction, or the date that a notice, which may be conditional, of repayment or
redemption in connection with a repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is given to the holders of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (any
such date, the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall be calculated with such
pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the
definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio
after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transactions and any actions or transactions
to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Liens, Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x)
if any of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or are not complied with as a result of fluctuations in
such basket, ratio or related financial metrics (including due to fluctuations in Fixed Charges, Consolidated Net
Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person that is otherwise the subject of the
Limited Condition Acquisition or the Specified Transaction during and after the Applicable Measurement Period) at
or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto, such baskets, ratios or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations and (y) such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the
time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction and any actions or

however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the
Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial metrics on the

applicable Transaction Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics, (b) if any ratios or
financial metrics improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics
or baskets may be utilized, (c) if the Testing Party elects to have such determinations occur at the Transaction Test
Date, any such transactions (including the Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction and any actions
or transactions related thereto) shall be deemed to have occurred on the Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or financial metrics under the Indenture after the
Transaction Test Date and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction
unless and until such Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by
the Testing Party, prior to the consummation thereof and (d) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the

margin, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party
has exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the
Transaction Test Date (including any new Transaction Test Date) for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition
or Specified Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or
Specified Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing
for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition
or Specified Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Issuer (as determined in good faith by the
Board or senior management of the Issuer), with reference to, if necessary in the good faith determination of the


-----

Board or senior management of the Issuer, any information delivered pursuant to the proviso in the seventh

Total Assets) under the Indenture, the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of any amount denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated, to the extent not already reflected in U.S. dollars in the relevant financial statements
(which may be internal), based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of the most recent
fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the Applicable Calculation
Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock

undertaken in reliance on a provision in any covenant (including any constituent definition thereof) of the Indenture
that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any Fixed Charge

on a provision of the Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation,
any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test) (any
such amounts, the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be
disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts (but any such
calculation, for the avoidance of doubt, shall give full pro forma effect to all applicable and related transactions,
including (but subject to the foregoing) any incurrence and repayments of Indebtedness and all other permitted pro
forma adjustments).

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, in the event an item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other
transaction is undertaken in reliance of a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the
incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in
connection therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of the Issuer, its Restricted Subsidiaries and any
Parent Entity (as reasonably determined by the Issuer).

(and, for the avoidance of doubt, not a straight-line or operating lease) on both the balance sheet and income
statement for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. At the time any determination thereof is to be

reflected as a liability on such balance sheet (excluding the footnotes thereto) in accordance with GAAP.

“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person as of any Applicable Calculation Date,

incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, repays, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness or issues or redeems
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the Applicable Measurement Period but
on or prior to the Applicable Calculation Date, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro
forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of
Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, including a pro
_forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable_
Measurement Period; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to any Indebtedness
incurred on such Applicable Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”; provided, further, that for purposes of the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, in connection
with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” such Person may elect to treat
an Elected Amount under any Indebtedness which is to be incurred (or any commitment thereunder), as being
incurred as of the Applicable Calculation Date and (i) any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such
commitment that was so treated (so long as the total amount under such Indebtedness does not exceed the Elected
Amount) shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence of additional Indebtedness at such
subsequent time, (ii) such Person may revoke an election of an Elected Amount and (iii) for subsequent calculations
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not
such amount is actually outstanding.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions (including the
Acquisition), dispositions, Divisions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations (as
determined in accordance with GAAP) and operational changes that have been made by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries during the Applicable Measurement Period or subsequent to such Applicable Measurement
Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Applicable Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, Divisions, mergers, amalgamations,
consolidations, disposed operations and operational changes (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the
Applicable Measurement Period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,


-----

amalgamation, consolidation, disposed operation (including any spin-off transaction) or operational change that
would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such Applicable Measurement Period as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, disposed operation or operational change
had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a
Subsidiary was previously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary but was redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary
during or subsequent to the Applicable Measurement Period and is a Restricted Subsidiary as of the Applicable
Calculation Date, the computation referred to above shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that such
redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any change
in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (and may
include, for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, cost savings, operating expense reductions and
synergies resulting from any Asset Sale or other disposition or such Investment, acquisition, disposition, Division,
merger, amalgamation or consolidation or other transaction (including the Transactions), in each case calculated in
accordance with and permitted by clause (2) of the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” herein). If any
Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness
shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Applicable Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the
entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance
with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a
revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of
such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if lower, the maximum commitments under such revolving credit
facility as of the Applicable Calculation Date. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall
be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen
as the Issuer may designate.

Accountants and statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in such other
statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession, which
are in effect from time to time; provided that unless the Issuer elects otherwise, as evidenced by a written notice of
the Issuer to the Trustee, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be construed, and
all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving effect to any
election under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or any successor
thereto (including pursuant to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the


-----

Issuer or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the accounting for operating leases and financing
or capital leases under U.S. GAAP as in effect on November 21, 2017 (including, without limitation, FASB
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840—Leases) shall apply for the purpose of determining compliance with
the provisions of the Indenture, including the definition of Financing Lease Obligation. At any time after the Issue
Date, the Issuer may elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election,
references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture); provided that any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, that any calculation
or determination in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended
prior to the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with
GAAP. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For
the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be
treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action) referred to in this
definition will not (1) be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness or (2) have the effect of rendering invalid any
Restricted Payment, Investment or other action made prior to the date of such election pursuant to the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, any incurrence of Indebtedness incurred
prior to the date of such election pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or any incurrence of Liens
pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (or any other action conditioned on the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries having been able to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness) if such Restricted Payment,
Investment, incurrence or other action was valid under the Indenture on the date made, incurred or taken, as the case
may be.

If there occurs or has occurred a change in generally accepted accounting principles and such change would
cause a change in the method of calculation of any term or measure used in the Indenture or the indentures
governing the Existing Senior Notes and such change would cause a change in the method of calculation of any term
or measure used in the Indenture (an “Accounting Change”), then the Issuer may elect, as evidenced by a written
notice of the Issuer to the Trustee, that such term or measure shall be calculated as if such Accounting Change had
not occurred.

any such Government Securities or a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such Government Securities
held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided that (except as required by

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of

interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (each as defined
below) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A
Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.

Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges
Among Global Notes.”

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for notes in certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited circumstances described below.

owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in
certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Regulation S
Notes will also be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will also bear the legend as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the
applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of
Euroclear or Clearstream), which may change from time to time.


-----

**Depositary Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of
convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge
investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are
not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the
indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants designated by the
initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership
of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests
therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not participants may hold their
interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in
such system. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear
or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants.
After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes through participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. All interests in
a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or
Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states
require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC
can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person
having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC
system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate
evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes**
**registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be**
**considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture governing the notes for any**
**purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture


-----

governing the notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the
Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer or the Trustee, nor any
agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect
participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect
participants.

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities
such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the
payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date.
Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the
principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the
indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the
responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by
DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may
conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with
the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its
respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the
relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued or changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.


-----

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each
case, a successor depositary is not appointed;

(2) the Issuer, at its option, notify the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the
Certificated Notes; or

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default with respect to the Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. In
all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will
be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary
(in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer
Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be provided in the indenture governing the notes) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, qualified institutional buyers under Rule
144A or institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for
beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant notes pursuant to Rule 144A;
and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form to be provided in the
indenture governing the notes) to the effect that the relevant notes are being transferred to a
Person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture governing the notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904


-----

of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests among the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule
144A Global Notes will be effected through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in
connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal
amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in
one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global
Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in such other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to
beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of
DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the
Distribution Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to
Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the
Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address.
The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be made eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds
Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by
DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated
Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by
or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date
of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes are subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing notes, you will be
deemed to have made the following acknowledgements, representations to and agreements with us and the initial
purchasers:

(1) You acknowledge that:

    - the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws and are being
offered for resale in transactions that do not require registration under the Securities Act or any other
securities laws; and

    - unless so registered, the notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except under an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities laws, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
forth in paragraph 5 below.

(2) You acknowledge that this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration
under the Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC rules that would apply to an offering
document relating to a public offering of securities.

(3) You represent that you are not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of ours,
that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

    - you are a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and are
purchasing notes for your own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer, and
you are aware that the initial purchasers are selling the notes to you in reliance on Rule 144A; or

    - you are not a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) or purchasing for the

offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(4) You acknowledge that neither we nor the initial purchasers nor any person representing us or the initial
purchasers have made any representation to you with respect to us or this offering of notes, other than the
information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge
that no representation or warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such
materials. You represent that you are relying only on the information contained or incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum in making your investment decision with respect to the notes. You agree that you have had
access to such financial and other information concerning us and the notes as you have deemed necessary in
connection with your decision to purchase notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request
information from us.

(5) You represent that you are purchasing notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts
for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any distribution of the notes in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their
control and subject to your or their ability to resell the notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for
which you are purchasing notes, and each subsequent holder of the notes by its acceptance of the notes will agree,
that until the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below), the notes may be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred only:

(a) to us or any of our subsidiaries;

(b) under a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act;


-----

(c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person the seller reasonably
believes is a qualified institutional buyer that is purchasing for its own account or for the account
of another qualified institutional buyer and to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) through offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the

the Securities Act) that is not a qualified institutional buyer and that is purchasing for its own
account or for the account of another institutional accredited investor, in each case in a minimum
principal amount of notes of $250,000; or

(f) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,

subject in each of the above cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property or the
property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control and to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws. Notwithstanding the above, holders will not be permitted to transfer the
notes in reliance on Rule 144 even after the applicable holding period has been satisfied.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the issuer, or any affiliate of the
issuer, was the owner of such note or an interest in such global note, and so may continue indefinitely.

(6) You also acknowledge that:

    - the above restrictions on resale will apply from the closing date until the date that is six months (in the
case of Rule 144A notes) after the later of the closing date, the closing date of the issuance of any
additional notes and the last date that we or any of our affiliates was the owner of the notes or any
predecessor of the notes or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S notes) after the later of the closing
date, the closing date of the issuance of any additional notes and when the notes or any predecessor of
the notes are first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in
reliance on Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply after the applicable
Resale Restriction Period ends;

    - if a holder of notes proposes to resell or transfer notes under clause (e) above before the applicable
Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to us and the trustee a letter from the purchaser
in the form set forth in the indenture which must provide, among other things, that the purchaser is an
institutional accredited investor that is acquiring the notes not for distribution in violation of the
Securities Act;

    - we and the trustee reserve the right to require in connection with any offer, sale or other transfer of
notes under clauses (d), (e) and (f) above the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or
other information satisfactory to us and the trustee; and

    - each note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and, in the case of Non-U.S. Holders
(as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date
hereof. This summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets by holders who purchase the notes for cash
upon original issuance at their initial offering price.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including
if you are:

    - a dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt entity;

    - an insurance company;

    - a controlled foreign corporation;

    - a passive foreign investment company;

    - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction
or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement;

    - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar; or

    - a United States expatriate.

If an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should
consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps
retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those
summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding
the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes that are different from those discussed below.


-----

This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income and estate taxes and does not
deal with foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their personal
circumstances. We cannot assure you that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we
describe in this summary.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning**
**the United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and**
**disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws**
**and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Contingent Payments**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control”), we may be obligated to make payments on the notes in excess of stated interest and
principal. We intend to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments
because of these additional payments. Assuming such position is respected, a holder of notes would be required to
include in income the amount of any such additional payment at the time such payments are received or accrued in
accordance with the holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described below under
“—Consequences to U.S. Holders—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of
Notes.” Our determination is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses a contrary treatment in a statement
attached to its timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the notes were acquired.
Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the notes of the contingent
payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the
notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Consequences to U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you
if you are a U.S. Holder.

A “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than an entity treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes) that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the
following:

    - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

    - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United
States person.

**_Notes_**

_Payments of Interest_

Interest on a note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in
accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.


-----

_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you will generally
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount you realize upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid qualified stated
interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and your adjusted
tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be your cost for that note. Any gain or loss you
recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held
the note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are
eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss
you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.

**Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences that will
apply to you if you are a Non-U.S. Holder. A “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes (other than an
entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal withholding tax
will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

    - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

    - you do not actually (or constructively) own stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States
Treasury regulations;

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through stock ownership;

    - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8, and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold
your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of
applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that
are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or other applicable form) claiming an
exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you recognize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note.


-----

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a United States permanent establishment), you will be subject to United States federal income tax on
that interest on a net income basis in generally the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined
under the Code, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if you are a corporation, you
may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively
connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. Any effectively connected interest will be exempt from the
30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United
States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain recognized on the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal
income tax unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment), in which case such gain will generally be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) in the same manner as effectively connected interest as described
above; or

    - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
the disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise, you generally will be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on
the gain recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, which
may be offset by certain United States source capital losses.

**_United States Federal Estate Tax_**

If you are an individual and are not a United States citizen or a resident of the United States (as specifically
defined for United States federal estate tax purposes), your estate will not be subject to United States federal estate
tax on notes beneficially owned by you at the time of your death, provided that any payment to you of interest on the
notes, if received at such time, would be eligible for exemption from the 30% United States federal withholding tax
under the “portfolio interest rule” described above under “—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” without
regard to the statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest and principal on a note and
the proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note paid to you,
unless you are an exempt recipient. A backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a
taxpayer identification number or a certification of exempt status, or if you fail to report in full dividend and interest
income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will
be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments generally will be
reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may


-----

also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable
income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes
provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a
United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the required
certification that you are a Non-U.S. Holder described above in the fifth bullet point under “—Consequences to
Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding may apply to the proceeds
of a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes within the United States or
conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the applicable
withholding agent under penalties of perjury that you are a Non-U.S. Holder (and the payor does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise
establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30%
United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial
institution” (as specifically defined in the Code) that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance)
with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States) in a manner that avoids withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in
the Code) that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either
(x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial
owners of such entity (if any). These rules generally apply regardless of whether the foreign financial institution or
non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner of the notes or an intermediary. If an interest payment is both
subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Consequences to
Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited
against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. While withholding under FATCA would also have applied
to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of the notes, proposed United States
Treasury regulations (upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued) eliminate FATCA
withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding these rules
and whether they may be relevant to your ownership of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to
Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code,” including the regulations
promulgated and the rules issued thereunder) or provisions under any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or
other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”),
and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or
arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Part 4 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management
or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered
Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a
guarantor or an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a
direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include,
without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank
collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23
respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment
advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the
Covered Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.
Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans
considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review
the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions
will be satisfied.


-----

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire
or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition. holding and
disposition of the notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws. Additionally, if any purchaser of a note is using assets of any Plan to acquire or hold the
notes, such purchaser will be deemed to represent that neither the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the guarantors nor
any of their respective affiliates has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with
respect to the purchaser’s decision to acquire or hold the notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding
the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and
whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers have exclusive
responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes do not violate the fiduciary responsibility or
prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws. Except as otherwise stated herein,
the sale of any notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, an initial purchaser, or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all legal requirements with respect to such
investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans
generally or any particular Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as representatives of each of the
initial purchasers named below in connection with the offering of the notes. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in a purchase agreement among us, the guarantors and the representatives on behalf of the several initial
purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and each of the initial purchasers has agreed, severally
and not jointly, to purchase from us, the respective principal amount of the notes set forth opposite its name in the
following table.

**Principal**
**Initial Purchasers** **Amount of Notes**
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ......................................................................................................... $
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC .............................................................................................................
BofA Securities, Inc. ........................................................................................................................
Barclays Capital Inc. ........................................................................................................................
PNC Capital Markets LLC ...............................................................................................................
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ............................................................................................................
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ...........................................................................................................
Total ......................................................................................................... $800,000,000

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that, in certain circumstances, the
purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers of such notes may be increased or the purchase
agreement may be terminated.

The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to
make in respect of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The representatives have advised us that the respective initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes
at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering
price or any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through
certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial
purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or
applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will
not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to
offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In
addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United
States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Settlement**

The Issuer expects that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about        ,
2021, which is the         business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as
“T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle


-----

in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade
to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second
business day before delivery should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed, such to certain exceptions, that for a period of 45 days after the
date of this offering memorandum, neither it nor any of the guarantors will, without the prior written consent of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
file with the Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any securities that are
substantially similar to the notes.

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer
quotation system.

We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the
notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any
market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the
notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be
adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general
economic conditions and other factors.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short
sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are
required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in
the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may
be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors
who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales
may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist
in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither
we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the representatives will engage in these
transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and
non-financial activities and services. Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided,


-----

and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the Issuer and to persons and entities with relationships
with the Issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. For example, certain of the
initial purchasers acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering, secondary equity offerings and
the Equity Offering and as initial purchasers in the offerings of the Existing Notes. An affiliate of Goldman Sachs &
Co. LLC acts as administrative agent under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, certain of the initial
purchasers or their respective affiliates are agents and lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities have
provided loan commitments to us to finance a portion of the Acquisition and are expected to participate in the Term
Loan Financing, for which they would receive customary fees in connection therewith.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge,
and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and
their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent
research views in respect of such assets, securities or financial instruments and may, at any time, hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97, as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering
memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018, as amended (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the


-----

EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer
of the notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

**_Additional Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom_**

professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005 (the “Order”); (ii) high net worth companies and persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Order: or (iii) any other person to whom it may lawfully be communicated (all such persons falling within (i)

offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such notes in the UK will be engaged in only with,
relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this offering memorandum or
any of its contents. The notes are not being offered to the public in the UK.

inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of the notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply
to our company or the guarantors under the notes; and (b) must comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA
with respect to anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

**_Notice to Prospective Investors in Hong Kong_**

The notes may not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document except for notes which are

“SFO”) other than (i) to “professional investors” as defined in the SFO and any rules made thereunder; or (ii) in
other circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies
