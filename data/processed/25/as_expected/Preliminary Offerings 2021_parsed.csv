Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to the second business day before delivery should consult their own advisors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

25,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2250,PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES,2250.1,,2250.1.1,,"This offering memorandum contains, or incorporates by reference, certain financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage, that are not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage have been presented in this offering memorandum as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included in this offering memorandum because they are key metrics used by management to assess our financial performance. We use these measures to supplement GAAP measures of performance in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We believe such measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our ----- industry and are helpful supplemental measures to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s core operational performance as they exclude costs that do not relate to the underlying operation of their business and include cost savings that are expected to occur. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are nonGAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, nor should they be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or other items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage contain certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and/or amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these adjustments as a projection that we will achieve these benefits but rather only as an indication of our current expectations. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage and reconciliations to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Any statements contained or incorporated by reference herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this offering memorandum as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum and under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Some of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. See “Description of Notes” for a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the notes and the indenture that will govern the notes._ Issuer ................................................** Avantor Funding, Inc. Notes Offered ...................................** $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % senior notes due 2029. Maturity ...........................................**, 2029 Interest ..............................................** Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of     % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on      and       of each year, commencing      , 2022. Interest will accrue from       , 2021. Guarantees .......................................** The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by Holdings and each of Holdings’ existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) to the extent such subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The guarantees of any guarantor will be automatically released in the event such guarantor’s guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is released (other than in connection with a refinancing or repayment in full of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities). See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” Ranking ............................................** The notes will be the Issuer’s and the guarantees will be the guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will: - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and each guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes; - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and each guarantor’s future subordinated indebtedness and other obligations that expressly provide for their subordination to the notes and the guarantees; - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Secured Notes and any other existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, including indebtedness under the A/R Facility. ----- As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions: - the notes and related guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $4,709.3 million of secured indebtedness, consisting primarily of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, the Term Loan Financing, the Existing Secured Notes and the A/R Facility; - there would have been additional availability (i) under the Revolver of up to $515.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and (ii) under the A/R Facility of up to $200.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). The Issuer can also incur additional secured indebtedness if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby; and - excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for approximately $3,185.3 million, or 45.2%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and approximately $7,692.0 million, or 68.4%, of its total assets as of June 30, 2021, and would have accounted for approximately $138.9 million, or 1.8%, of its total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2021. Special Mandatory Redemption .....** In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption provisions. The consummation of the Acquisition pursuant to the Purchase Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. The “Initial Outside Date” with respect to the notes shall be December 31, 2021, subject to the extension to a date that is not later than February 28, 2022, or the “Extended Outside Date.” The Initial Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date, as applicable, are referred to herein as the “Outside Date.” In the event that (a) the completion date of the Acquisition does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Initial Outside Date (or, if extended, the Extended Outside Date) or (c) the Purchase Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Initial Outside Date (or, if extended, the Extended Outside Date), the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes will be a price equal to 100% of the issue price of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes from the initial issue date to the redemption date, or the “special mandatory redemption price.” See “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.” Optional Redemption ......................** The Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to       , 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” ----- premium, as described under the heading “Description of Notes— Optional Redemption.” At any time on or after       , 2024, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at the redemption prices described under the heading “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Additionally, from time to time prior to       , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed (i) with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds that we raise in one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Change of Control ...........................** Upon the occurrence of certain kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of the Holders—Change of Control.” We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to us at the time of a change of control, because: - we may not have enough funds at that time; or - the terms of our indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may prevent us from making such payment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes— The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control required by the indenture that will govern the notes.” Certain Covenants ...........................** The indenture that will govern the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to: - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; - incur liens or use assets as security in other transactions; - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and - merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of our management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results for these periods. The results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. We have also presented summary unaudited consolidated financial data for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021, which does not comply with GAAP. This data has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited statement of operations and cash flow data for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 from the audited statement of operations and cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2020 and then adding the unaudited statement of operations and cash flow data for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

This advisory agreement was terminated upon consummation of the IPO. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and is a helpful supplemental measure to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s core operational performance as it excludes costs that do not relate to the underlying operation of their business. We define Consolidated EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to reflect items that are generally permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and the credit agreements that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We describe these adjustments reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated EBITDA in the table below. We believe Consolidated EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and is a helpful supplemental measure to provide additional insight in evaluating a company’s performance as it further includes cost savings that are expected to occur. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income or loss exclusive of amortization as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain costs related to the IPO, our reorganization and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors as a way to analyze the underlying trends in our core business consistently across the periods inclusive of interest and depreciation. We define Adjusted Net Leverage as gross debt, reduced by our cash and cash equivalents, divided by our trailing 12-month Adjusted EBITDA (excluding stock-based compensation expense and including the run-rate effect of synergies). We believe Adjusted Net Leverage is useful to investors as a way to evaluate and measure the Company’s capital allocation strategies and the underlying trends in the business. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are non-GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, nor should it be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or other items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage contain certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Leverage is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income or loss, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, using data derived from our consolidated financial statements, in each case for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

(b) Represents remeasurement of various foreign-denominated borrowings into functional currencies. Our U.S. subsidiaries carry a significant amount of euro-denominated debt, and many of our subsidiaries borrow and lend with each other in foreign currencies. Through July 11, 2019, the foreign currency losses were primarily caused by unhedged intercompany loans receivable ranging from €190 million and €795 million. On July 11, 2019, we completed an intercompany recapitalization that is intended to mitigate substantially all of our net euro financing exposure in future periods. We still expect to record gains and losses related to intercompany borrowings denominated in other currencies. Historically, the remeasurement of borrowings denominated in currencies other than the euro has not been material. (c) Represents expenses primarily related to remeasuring standalone appreciation rights at fair value on a recurring basis and the vesting of performance stock options with the completion of our IPO. (d) Represents the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, each incurred as a result of refinancing our outstanding indebtedness or making significant prepayments on our term loans, and which were otherwise classified as interest expense in our prior presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of a loss on extinguishment of debt of $73.7 million in 2019, we determined it was appropriate to include this as an addition to Adjusted Net Income, and also to include the related 35% tax effect in the income tax benefit applicable to pretax adjustments.

The most significant adjustment in 2019 was a normalization of expense for prepaid customer rebates that were derecognized in purchase accounting. (g) Represents direct expenses incurred to consummate the VWR Acquisition and other expenses incurred related to the planning and integration of VWR. (h) Represents the accounting effects of tax reform legislation enacted in the United States. In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for U.S. tax reform, which included interpreting new transition tax regulations issued in 2018. In connection with finalizing our provisional accounting, we recognized an income tax benefit of $27.3 million, consisting of a $48.8 million benefit related to the one-time transition tax, offset in part by an expense of $21.5 million related to deferred tax remeasurement. During the preparation of our third quarter 2019 results, we concluded that it was more appropriate to remove the impact of these onetime benefits from U.S. tax reform in the calculation of Adjusted Net Income, and reclassify such impact as an increase to the income tax benefit provision applicable to Adjusted Net Income. As a result, Adjusted Net Income for 2018 was reduced by $27.3 million, but there were no changes to the amount of 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.

We intend to use the net proceeds of the Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our A/R Facility, to finance the Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Transactions will be consummated on the terms contemplated, or at all, and this offering is not conditioned on the completion of the Acquisition or the Term Loan Financing. In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition then, pending the consummation of the Acquisition then the notes will be subject to certain special mandatory redemption provisions. To the extent the Acquisition is not consummated or certain other conditions are not met, the notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption. See “—If the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date or certain other conditions are not met, the Issuer will be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes” and “Description of Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.” In addition, regardless of whether we close the Acquisition, the expected benefits of the Acquisition may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to potential complications with respect to Masterflex’s integration; potential disruptions to Masterflex’s management or current or future plans and operations due to the Acquisition; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise. Failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results following the consummation of the Acquisition and many of these costs will be borne by us even if the Acquisition is not consummated. In addition, if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our investment in Masterflex were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value, the investment would be written down to its fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had approximately $7,533.3 million of indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, including the notes offered hereby, and estimated cash interest for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 would have been approximately $297.0 million. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would also have had an additional $515.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and an additional $200.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit). The Issuer’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and to the holders of the notes, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and or other debt; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could further adversely impact our cash flows; - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Notes.” The Issuer’s ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under such debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of the Issuer’s debt depends on, among ----- other things, the Issuer’s operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The Issuer is not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, the Issuer’s cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the Issuer to pay principal and interest on its debt, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Existing Notes, and meet its other obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

The Issuer’s ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Issuer’s future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet such obligations and commitments. If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its indebtedness and to meet its other commitments, the Issuer will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring the Issuer’s indebtedness (including the notes), selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy the Issuer’s capital requirements. In addition, the Issuer’s existing or future debt agreements contain and will contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The Issuer’s failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debts. See “Description of Notes.” In addition, the Issuer conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which will not be issuers or guarantors of the notes or its other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of such indebtedness, including the notes, will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such other indebtedness, the subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes or such other indebtedness, as applicable, or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from the Issuer’s subsidiaries. While the indentures that govern the Existing Notes, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness limit, and the indenture that will govern the notes will limit, the ability of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are, in the case of our existing debt, and will be, in the case of the notes offered hereby, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. If the Issuer cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Issuer will be in default, and as a result, holders of the notes and certain of its other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under such agreements and the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which, in each case, could result in your losing all or a portion of your investment in the notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

The notes will be effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes. As of June 30, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the aggregate amount of the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries secured indebtedness would have been $4,709.3 million, and there would have been $515.0 million (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) of availability under the Revolver and $200.0 million of availability under the A/R Facility (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit), all of which would have been effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, the Issuer is permitted to add incremental facilities under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and additional secured indebtedness, including additional Existing Secured Notes, under the indentures governing the Existing Notes, in each case, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial and the holders of which will also be entitled to the remedies available to a secured lender. See “Description of Notes.” If the Issuer becomes insolvent or is liquidated, or if payment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or under the Existing Secured Notes is accelerated, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured holder under applicable law (in addition to any remedies that may be available under documents pertaining to such indebtedness).

In that event, the Issuer’s assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes), resulting in all or a portion of the Issuer’s assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of the Issuer’s assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding, holders of the notes will participate in the Issuer’s remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of the Issuer’s unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the notes, and potentially with all of the Issuer’s other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, the Issuer cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes.

See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the indentures that govern the Existing Notes permit, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, to incur certain additional indebtedness, and will not limit their ability to incur trade payables and similar liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder. You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is liquidated, reorganized or ----- dissolved, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors, including trade creditors, banks and other lenders, followed by claims of any holders of preferred stock of such nonguarantor subsidiary. Only the residual equity value will be available to us and the Issuer’s guarantors, and only to the extent the Issuer or any guarantor is a parent company of such non-guarantor subsidiary. Consequently, each guarantee of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.

The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released.

The agreements governing the Issuer’s indebtedness restrict or will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - make loans and investments; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets; - sell stock of the Issuer’s subsidiaries; - create or incur liens; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into agreements restricting the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or to incur liens on assets; - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the lenders; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Issuer is and will be limited in how the Issuer conducts its business, and the Issuer may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

LIBOR and other “benchmark” rates are subject to ongoing national and international regulatory scrutiny and reform. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rates after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced in a public statement the future cessation of quotations for tenors of overnight/Spot next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S.-dollar LIBOR. The FCA’s announcements indicate that LIBOR will not continue to exist on the current basis. U.S.-dollar LIBOR is expected to be replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference ----- to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether any of these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. There is currently no definitive successor reference rate to LIBOR and various industry organizations are still working to develop workable transition mechanisms. As part of this industry transition, we will be required to migrate any current adjustable rate loans we service to any such successor reference rate. Until a successor rate is determined, we cannot implement the transition away from LIBOR for the adjustable rate loans we service. As such, we are unable to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the establishment and success of any alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR or any replacement of LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States or elsewhere. Such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us. LIBOR-related changes could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition. The outcome of reforms may result in increased interest expense to us, affect our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us and may result in increased costs related to amending our existing debt instruments, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Under these statutes, the notes and the guarantees could be avoided, or claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees could be subordinated to all of the Issuer’s other indebtedness, if a court were to find at the time the Issuer or such guarantor issued the notes or incurred a guarantee of the notes, that the Issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the note or incurring the guarantee, and: - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of such indebtedness; - was engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer or guarantor would incur, indebtedness beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to repay such debts as they mature. A court might also avoid the issuance of the notes or a guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the applicable guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ respective creditors. If a court were to avoid the issuance of the Notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. If a note or a guarantee is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. You may also be required to return payments you have received, as the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors with respect to such note and guarantees. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor made at a time when the Issuer or such guarantor is subsequently found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days to any non-insider party and such ----- payment would give the holders of notes more than such holders of notes would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, or the “Bankruptcy Code.” As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance or transfer and preferences laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding. Generally, however, the Issuer would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all the Issuer’s assets; - the present fair saleable value of the Issuer’s assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay the Issuer’s probable liability on existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - the Issuer could not pay the Issuer’s debts as they become due. The Issuer cannot assure you as to the standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with the Issuer’s conclusions in this regard that the Issuer and the guarantors will not be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the issuance of the notes and the guarantees. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee would not be avoided as a preference, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer. The Issuer cannot assure you such a savings clause limitation, as a legal matter will protect such guarantees from fraudulent conveyance or transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (1) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, the Issuer may need to refinance the notes and/or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, the Issuer could require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may ----- cause the acceleration of the Issuer’s other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes. The indentures governing the Existing Notes also contain similar change of control offer provisions. The credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt arrangements may contain similar provisions. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under such other indebtedness, the Issuer would probably require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral, thereby limiting the Issuer’s ability to raise cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

The initial purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, including: - the number of holders of notes; - the Issuer’s operating performance and financial condition; - the market for similar securities; - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; - prevailing interest rates; and - the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade indebtedness has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). In addition, the Existing Senior Notes contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions described in this “—Change of Control” section. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Existing Senior Notes, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities, the ----- Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Existing Senior Notes could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes and/or such other agreements being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a change of control, which would result in a default under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer or any Parent Entity, and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We currently have no intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party approved in writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, provided that such notice is given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change _of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment (excluding any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest to any Holder in such Change of Control Payment) in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the offer to purchase a Holder’s Notes in the tender offer is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender premium or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $150.0 million (the “Excess _Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of_ other Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within twenty Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by transmitting electronically or mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (such remaining proceeds, the “Declined Proceeds”) in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee or applicable depositary shall select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination; provided that no Notes of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility (including under the Senior Credit Facilities) or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions described in the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

In the event the Issuer is contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

The period of time between (and including) the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date (but excluding the Reversion Date) is referred to in this “Description of Notes” as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was deemed to be incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt, for purposes of this covenant; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because such Indebtedness is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness solely because such Indebtedness has a junior priority with respect to shared collateral or because it is secured by sufficient collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, is ----- in the aggregate, in excess of $300.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) at any one time outstanding;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as determined as of the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee shall not have knowledge or notice of an Event of Default, unless it shall have received written notice thereof. The Indenture will provide further that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders. The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes; provided such rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: ----- (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the total then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to a responsible officer of the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders of the Notes, other than a Regulated Bank (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and a responsible officer of the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of such Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe that a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at ----- such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to the acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of the Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction, Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement, or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within fifteen Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Consequently, neither the Issuer or the Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect participants. DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a guarantor or an initial purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. ----- Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,150

Additionally, if any purchaser of a note is using assets of any Plan to acquire or hold the notes, such purchaser will be deemed to represent that neither the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the guarantors nor any of their respective affiliates has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the purchaser’s decision to acquire or hold the notes. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.
