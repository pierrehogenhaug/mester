367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1239,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES,1239.1,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,1239.1.1,,"This offering memorandum contains non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Our nonIFRS financial measures are defined by us as follows: We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain costs we consider to be non-recurring. We define “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We define “capital expenditure” as the sum of additions to intangible assets and additions to property, plant and equipment. ----- We define “EBIT” as earnings before interest and taxes. We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define “gross margin” as gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We define “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain costs we consider to be non-recurring and historical costs charged by Siemens for activities that will no longer be performed or required or have been absorbed into existing functions of the Target and its subsidiaries. We define “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We present non-IFRS financial measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. We present a reconciliation of each of the non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its limitations. For a reconciliation of these nonIFRS financial measures, refer to “Summary Historical Condensed Combined Financial Information and Other Financial _Data.”_ EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the corresponding terms under the indenture. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required to make such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS financial measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Audiology Solutions have been prepared on a carve-out basis from the Siemens AG consolidated financial statements using the historical results from operations, assets and liabilities and cash flows attributable to Siemens Audiology Solutions and include allocations of expenses, assets and liabilities from Siemens AG. All intra-group balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions between companies comprising Siemens Audiology Solutions and all investments and the respective parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary comprising Siemens Audiology Solutions have been eliminated.

The Combined Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the combined statements of income, the combined statements of financial position or the combined statements of cash flow that may occur as a result of the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) to be applied as a result of the Acquisition. The application of PPA adjustments could result in different carrying amounts for existing assets and assets we may add to our combined statements of financial position, which may include intangible assets such as goodwill, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Our future consolidated financial statements could be materially different from the Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum once the PPA adjustments have been made. We present in this offering memorandum certain financial information on an adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Acquisition, including the application of the net proceeds of the Offering as described in “Use of Proceeds.” See “Capitalization.” The unaudited pro forma data are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position would have been if the Transactions occurred on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma data set forth in this offering memorandum are based upon available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results following consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial data have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus Directive.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a pure play manufacturer of hearing instruments with more than 100 years of experience in audiology. With more than three million units manufactured annually, we believe we are the largest global manufacturer by volume and third largest global manufacturer by revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Our innovative and technologically advanced hearing instruments and complementary diagnostics workflow solutions and service have helped build our marketleading positions in Asia, Europe and North America. We are headquartered in Singapore and employ approximately 5,000 employees. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €690.4 million (an increase of 3.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €156.9 million (22.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) and incurred capital expenditure of €18.8 million (2.7% of revenue). We offer a broad and competitive range of innovative, high-quality hearing instrument products across all price categories and instrument types, serving consumers with varying degrees of hearing loss. Our product portfolio comprises Behind-the-Ear (“BTE”), In-the-Ear (“ITE”) and Receiver-in-the-Canal (“RIC”) devices and related accessories, diagnostic tools and services. Our recent innovations include our micon product family, based upon our proprietary micon technology platform, which has been a key driver of our revenue growth since its launch in 2012, and our binax product family, based upon our proprietary binax technology platform, a binaural hearing system launched in October 2014. We market our products to a fragmented base of over 2,500 customers through multiple distribution channels. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, independent dispensers generated the largest share of our revenue (approximately 37%) followed by key accounts (approximately 29%), distributors (approximately 22%) and public funded healthcare systems (approximately 12%). Our customers include well-known companies such as Amplifon, Audionova and Costco and government agencies such as the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (“NHS”), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and Australian Hearing in Australia. We have a global and low-cost manufacturing footprint. Our serial production of BTE devices is located in Asia, while we manufacture customized ITE instruments at sites closer to our endusers, allowing us to reduce lead times and maintain high customer service. Approximately 2,700 of our employees work in manufacturing, including approximately 1,000 in low-cost countries such as China, Indonesia and Poland. Our R&D teams are consolidated at two principal locations in Singapore and Germany.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Highly attractive and resilient market underpinned by strong fundamentals,"We operate in an attractive market characterized by strong and stable growth. Because of the importance of hearing instruments in maintaining quality of life for end-users, the global hearing instruments market historically has been relatively unaffected by macroeconomic factors and has proven to be resilient during the recent global financial crisis. Furthermore, the hearing instruments market historically has benefited from a generally stable regulatory environment and comparatively low price sensitivity of end-users. According to a major consulting firm, the global hearing instruments market has grown in value at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2003 and 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% to 5% between 2014 and 2018, driven by several favorable demographic trends and other factors, including: _Aging population and increasing prevalence of hearing loss_ The proportion of the global population aged 65 and older, of which 35-40% show some degree of hearing loss, has demonstrated consistent historic growth (approximately 3% CAGR between 2003 and 2013) and is expected to increase by approximately 4% CAGR between 2014 and 2018 primarily due to the “baby boomer” generation reaching retirement age and longer life expectancy. ----- _Increasing penetration rates_ According to a major consulting firm, the global penetration rate of hearing instruments is still very low at approximately 25% as of 2013, although it has consistently grown over the last five years driven primarily by a number of socio-economic factors and technological improvement. Consistently growing penetration rates provide a very attractive market opportunity for us. We are particularly focused on increasing our presence geographically in markets and among groups of end-users that have comparatively low penetration rates but high growth potential. In APAC, penetration is particularly low. We believe that manufacturers with substantial revenue exposure to APAC, such as ourselves, will benefit from rapidly increasing penetration in these regions. _Increasing binaural adoption rates_ According to a major consulting firm, the share of users wearing hearing instruments in both ears, or binaural hearing instruments, was approximately 39% in 2013 and is expected to increase by 1% annually, on average, over the next four years. We believe that up to 80% of the hearing impaired population could benefit from using binaural hearing instruments, which offer improved hearing in group environments, better ability to locate speakers and superior sound compared to wearing a hearing instrument in only one ear.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Limited reliance on reimbursement regimes and stable regulatory environment,"While government funded reimbursement programs constitute a very important distribution channel in our market, the level of reimbursement of hearing instruments is generally low compared to other healthcare markets, such as pharmaceuticals. This contributes to the resilience of the global hearing instruments market as decreases in government spending as a result of macroeconomic, political or other factors have a comparatively limited effect on the demand for hearing instruments. In addition, we have a limited exposure to public tenders (approximately 12% of revenue for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014), and we believe that only a small percentage of end-users who purchase our hearing instruments through other channels relies on insurance or government reimbursement regimes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Most profitable segment in the value chain supported by high barriers to entry and limited substitution risk,"We operate in the most profitable part of the hearing instrument value chain, which consists of three groups: (i) component manufacturers, (ii) original hearing instrument manufacturers (“OEMs”) such as ourselves and (iii) distributors. While leading hearing instrument manufacturers have consistently shown EBIT margins above 20%, component manufacturers and distributors generally report EBIT margins between 5% and 15%. Our position in the value chain is attractive because (i) component manufacturers represent only a small proportion of the value chain and many components are assembled in-house directly by OEMs resulting in limited supplier risk, (ii) distribution continues to be very fragmented in most countries despite some consolidation in recent years, allowing hearing instrument manufacturers to negotiate favorable terms with distributors (iii) the manufacturer market is concentrated with six players accounting for more than 90% of the market and (iv) there is a limited competitive threat from new entrants in low-cost countries, as leading manufacturers already have a significant production footprint in low-cost countries. High barriers to entry also contribute to a stable competitive environment and resilient margins. The global manufacturing base and high technological capabilities necessary to compete in the hearing instrument market require substantial up-front investment, particularly in R&D for sound processing and miniaturization of components. Our engineering know-how, built up over several decades, and continuous development of new products support the significant barriers to new entrants. In addition, a fragmented distribution channel requires a large and effective sales force as well as deep integration of OEMs with their distribution partners, which cannot be easily replicated. Distributors are closely tied to OEMs through their fitting software, after-sales support, customer service and long-standing relationships. Further, hearing instruments are classified as Class I and Class II medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FDA regulates, among other things, the design, development, testing, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, labelling, advertising, promotion, sales, distribution and post-market performance of such products, and all companies must comply with FDA regulations in order to compete in the United States, which is one of the most profitable markets in the world. Additionally, regulation of the hearing instruments industry generally limits the fitting of hearing devices to qualified professionals, creating an additional barrier for new entrants and new technologies. Finally, there are limited alternatives for hearing impaired end-users. Implants, for example, are more expensive, require medical surgery and are riskier than hearing instruments. In addition, hearing instruments and implants are used for different levels of hearing losses (with hearing instruments covering mild to severe hearing impairments and implants used for profound hearing loss) and are not necessarily considered substitutes. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,"Leading market participant with strong market positions in Europe, Asia and North America","We believe that we are the leading global hearing instruments manufacturer by volume with more than three million units manufactured annually. In addition, we believe we are the third largest manufacturer of hearing instruments on a value basis with an approximately 18% market share of the global manufacturer market in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, which consists of manufacturing and developing hearing instruments and distributing them into various sales channels. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by volume in key markets such as France and Australia. We also believe we are the largest manufacturer by volume in China and India, which are two of the fastest growing hearing instruments markets globally. We believe we are the second largest manufacturer by volume in the United Kingdom and the third largest in Germany. Also, in the last few years, we have managed to significantly improve our market position in North America, where we now believe we are the fourth largest manufacturer and distributor as measured by units sold. We also have leading positions with major independent distributors in various countries such as Amplifon and Costco and national public health institutions such as the NHS in the United Kingdom, the VA in the United States and Australian Hearing in Australia. Our market-leading positions provide us with significant bargaining power with customers and suppliers and help us to maintain a large, profitable and geographically diversified network of customers.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,Proven performance achieved through industry-leading innovation and structural measures,"In the last three years, we have grown our business and increased our market share due to multiple strategic and operational initiatives implemented by our CEO Dr. Roger Radke, our CFO Marcus Desimoni and our wider management team. After joining the Company in 2010, our CEO and CFO reshaped the entire organization, hired a new management team, drove a new product strategy and started to implement other operational measures that have driven growth and margin expansion. These initiatives addressed the perceived technological gap with key competitors, significantly improved our sales approach and client proximity, established a focus on profitability and capital allocation and rationalized our manufacturing and R&D footprint, thereby enhancing our competitive positioning and financial profile. Renewed focus on developing innovative products has driven our financial performance in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014. For example, in October 2012, we launched a new line of products based on our proprietary micon technology platform, which represented a significant leap in processing power compared to its predecessor platform. Given its feedback cancellation, flexibility in frequency shaping and directional computational capabilities, micon helped us to improve penetration with independent audiologists and improve our average selling prices (“ASPs”). With more than 1.5 million units sold since its launch, micon has been a key driver of revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In October 2014, we launched our newest and most advanced generation of products based on the binax technology platform, the first technology platform based on binaural hearing. Since its launch, the binax platform has received strong positive feedback by customers and industry experts. We believe that binax is widely viewed as one of the most innovative technologies in the global hearing instruments market due to its automatically adjusting binaural features, optimized wind noise reduction, improved directionality, strong speech/span and direction solutions and low battery consumption. Furthermore, we have improved our sales approach in our key markets like the U.S. and Germany. We have hired new sales directors in both countries. We have adopted a proactive channel strategy focused primarily on the profitable segment of independent dispensers, from whom we typically achieve higher ASPs and thus higher margins, as opposed to our previous focus on key accounts. For example in Germany, between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we proactively sought to achieve better economic terms on supply contracts with certain large accounts, which resulted in a decline in units in the short term but that was more than offset by higher revenue generated by independent dispensers. As a result of this shift in distribution strategy, revenue from independent dispensers grew from 33% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 to 37% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This shift allowed us to increase average ASPs over the same period, while ASPs in the overall hearing instruments market were generally on a slightly decreasing trajectory. We have also pursued a selective forward integration strategy in the United States by acquiring HearUSA. Since the acquisition, HearUSA has shown strong financial performance. In the last three years, our management team has closed seven ITE manufacturing plants and successfully implemented a reorganization of our production facilities aimed at (i) rationalizing production capacity, (ii) increasing the share of manufacturing in low-cost countries and (iii) increasing automation to reduce operating costs and lead times. Historically, our production was characterized by a high share of manual labor compared to automated processes. However, between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, we increased the proportion of automated production from approximately 14% to approximately 31% of total units produced. The micon platform launched in 2012 was the first platform manufactured in a fully automated production process in Singapore, and we expect the share of automated production to further increase with the new binax platform. ----- We have also consolidated five R&D centers into two in order to achieve higher productivity while still maintaining overall R&D expenses at approximately 7% as percentage of revenue over the last three fiscal years in line with our key competitors. Consolidating R&D centers has increased efficiency by leveraging the synergies inherent in having personnel concentrated in the same locations and facilitating the exchange of ideas among R&D personnel. In parallel, we have invested in improving our technological expertise, such as strengthening our wireless team, and we have developed and expanded our Asian R&D base, which has been a driving force behind the binax development. As a result of strategic and operational initiatives, we believe we have regained market share in some regions such as North America and France and increased revenue at 3.0% CAGR (6.4% CAGR on a constant currency basis) between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Following the Acquisition, we will continue to be led by our strong management team, which has a proven track record and is well-positioned to continue to drive our strategy. We will also benefit from the relationships and knowledge of our new shareholders EQT VI Limited and Santo Holding (Deutschland) GmbH (“Santo” and, together with EQT VI Limited the “Investors”).",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.6,"Highly diversified business model across channels, geographies and customers","We distribute our wide portfolio of products through a range of distribution channels serving different markets and geographies, which helps mitigate declines in any particular market or region. Our global operations have balanced exposure to North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, our operations in North America generated 35% of our revenue, our operations in EMEA and Latin America generated 43% of our revenue (with Germany generating 17% of our revenue, France generating 10% of our revenue and the United Kingdom generating 5% of our revenue) and APAC generated 22% of our revenue. We market our products through four distribution channels. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, independent dispensers generated the largest share of our revenue (approximately 37%) followed by key accounts (approximately 29%), distributors (approximately 22%) and government healthcare systems such as the NHS, VA and Australia Hearing (approximately 12%). In recent years, key initiatives implemented by our management team have resulted in increased exposure to independent dispensers. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, our top ten customers generated 26% of total revenue and we served a fragmented base of more than 2,500 customers. In line with focusing on independent dispensers, we expect to serve an even more fragmented customer base in the future. Further, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we derived approximately 18% of our revenue from the sale of accessories, workflow solutions and repair and maintenance services.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.7,Low cost manufacturing footprint with further streamlining potential,"We believe that we have one of the largest manufacturing footprints and one of the most efficient manufacturing processes in the industry, driven primarily by (i) standardized BTE or RIC hearing instruments produced entirely in low-cost serial production plants in Singapore, China and Indonesia and (ii) a significantly streamlined production network for ITE hearing instruments. Serial production of BTE devices is located in Asia, while customized production of ITE instruments is closer to end-users to reduce lead times and maintain high customer service. We have a longstanding presence in Asia where we have concentrated most of our production since the early 1990s. We were a pioneer in our industry in building large scale and standardized production in low-cost countries and now have a significant share of our total manufacturing workforce based in China, Indonesia and Singapore. Further, in 2011, we established a European Manufacturing Centre in Poland for the assembly of ITE devices in Europe, which allowed us to reduce our UK workforce in 2013 and reorganize our ITE production in France in 2014. Having a significant share of production in low-cost countries represents a key competitive advantage for us. We have further improved production efficiency in recent years by increasing the automation share of our production processes.

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property and assets that secure the Notes on a second-priority basis (including indebtedness incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed (on a senior subordinated basis) by Auris Holding GmbH and Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. The Target and certain of the Target’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes (on a ----- senior subordinated basis) within 90 days of the Completion Date. The Completion Date Guarantors generated 85% of our EBITDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and held 66% of our total assets as of September 30, 2014. (5) The Issuer is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) organized and established under the laws of Luxembourg formed for purposes of the Acquisition and has no business operations or revenue generating operations on its own. The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts, its interest in the Escrow Account and the equity interests it holds in its direct subsidiary, Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. Upon the release of funds from the Escrow Account on the Completion Date, the Issuer will extend one or more inter-company loans to Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. in an amount equal to the proceeds of the Notes (the “Notes Proceeds Loan”). Following the release of funds from the Escrow Account, the only significant assets of the Issuer are expected to be the cash in its bank accounts, amounts owed to the Issuer under intercompany loans and the equity interests it holds in Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. (6) Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. is a holding company formed for the purpose of facilitating the Acquisition and has no business operations or revenue generating operations on its own. Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. was originally incorporated as Auris Luxembourg III S.A. on April 10, 2014 and was converted to Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. on November 21, 2014. The only significant assets of Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and the equity interests it holds in its direct subsidiary, Auris Holding GmbH. Following the release of funds from the Escrow Account, the only significant assets of Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. are expected to be the cash in its bank accounts, amounts owed to Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. under intercompany loans and the equity interests it holds in Auris Holding GmbH. (7) Auris Holding GmbH is a holding company formed for the purpose of facilitating the Acquisition and has no business operations or revenue generating operations on its own. Auris Holding GmbH was incorporated on October 10, 2014. The only significant assets of Auris Holding GmbH on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and the equity interests it holds in its direct subsidiary, the Target. Following the release of funds from the Escrow Account, the only significant assets of Auris Holding GmbH are expected to be the cash in its bank accounts, amounts owed to Auris Holding GmbH under intercompany loans and the equity interests it holds in the Target. (8) The Senior Facilities Agreement consists of (i) a Facility B term loan comprising euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated tranches, in an aggregate amount equal to the equivalent of €785.0 million and (ii) a €75.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. To secure their obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors (including Siemens Audiologie SAS, which will guarantee the Senior Facilities Agreement but will not guarantee the Notes due to French legal limitations) will provide security over bank accounts, fixed assets, insurance policies, intellectual property, receivables and shares in accordance with and subject to agreed security principles. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.” The final euro equivalent amount under Facility B may change at signing of the Senior Facilities Agreement depending on tranche allocations and foreign currency movements but such changes are not expected to be material. (9) Auris Luxembourg I S.A. is the sole shareholder of Auris Luxembourg II S.A., which is the sole shareholder of Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l., which is the sole shareholder of Auris Holding GmbH, which is the sole shareholder of the Target. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to reflect historical costs charged by Siemens for activities that will no longer be performed or required or have been absorbed into existing functions of the Target and its subsidiaries as if such measures had been effected on October 1, 2013. See footnote (3) for information on the limitations of this measure. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons why we consider it appropriate as a method of supplemented analysis. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. Our management also believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for assessing our performance because they are adjusted for certain items which are non-recurring or which management believes are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. You should be aware that we are likely to incur expenses similar to certain of the adjustments in this presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature.

We face strong competitors, some of which may have greater resources or a stronger financial profile that may better enable them to exploit changes in our industry on a cost-competitive basis. Specific competitors might be more effective and faster in capturing available market opportunities, which in turn may negatively impact our market share. Our main competitors, such as Sonova and William Demant, are well-established operators in the hearing instrument market. The risk that new players may enter the market could also be facilitated if, as a consequence of regulatory changes, the qualifications required to sell hearing instruments becomes less stringent. Recent trends of manufacturers’ forwardintegration into the retail market for hearing instruments in certain countries may accelerate, reducing our access to the independent dispensers channel, and eroding our competitive position. We face downward price pressure from certain customers, especially governments, key accounts and customers in certain geographic areas. These factors alone or in combination may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

For us to remain competitive, it is essential to develop and bring to market new technologies or to find new applications for existing technologies at an increasing speed. If we are unable to meet customer demands for new technology, or the technologies we introduce are viewed less favorably than our competitors, our results of operations and future prospects may be negatively affected. To meet our customers’ needs in these areas, we must continuously design new, and update, existing products and invest in and develop new technologies. For example, our platforms generally have a duration of approximately three years before new products containing new technology come to the market. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we derived approximately 56% of our revenue from products launched within the past two fiscal years. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in the hearing instruments market, to maintain innovation leadership, to maintain a strong product pipeline and to reduce the costs of producing high-quality new and existing hearing instruments. Any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

We may not be able to adequately predict consumer trends and be unable to adjust our production in a timely manner.","We do business on a global basis and market our products through several distinct distribution channels. As our regional markets and distribution channels are subject to, and tend to react quite differently to, general economic developments and innovation milestones, we face the risk of significant changes in the demand for our products. Adapting to such evolving patterns of demand is expensive, as it requires, if demand decreases, capacity and cost reductions involving restructuring costs or, if demand increases, capital expenditures to set up new or reopen or ramp-up production lines or cost increases to hire and train production personnel and strengthen the sales force. Adapting to changes in demand, by necessity, also lags behind the actual developments as it takes time to identify the change the market is undergoing and for any measures taken to gain traction. Finally, capacity adjustments are inherently risky as there is imperfect information and ----- market trends may rapidly intensify, ebb or even reverse. We have in the past not always been, and may in the future not be, able to timely predict trends in demand and consumer behavior or to take appropriate measures to mitigate risks and exploit opportunities resulting from such trends.

The prices for our products tend to decline over time and we need to compensate price declines by new product introductions, productivity improvements, changes in channel mix and strict cost controls in order to avoid a deterioration of our results of operation.","The hearing instruments industry generally is characterized by price erosion after a product has been on the market for an extended period of time. One of the results of the rapid innovation that is exhibited by the hearing instruments industry is that pricing pressure, especially on products containing older technology, can be intense. In order to profitably supply these products, we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower net sales we can expect to receive per unit. Usually, this is accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will not be able to make a profit from the sale of these products.

The discovery of a cure for the various forms of hearing loss, the development of self-fitting hearing instruments, other alternatives to hearing instruments, such as personal sound amplifiers or unexpected manufacturing platforms could result in a decreased use of our products and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.6,Accelerated consolidation and formation of purchasing groups by retailers increases the pricing pressure on our products.,"As many audiology retailers are consolidating to create new entities with greater market power, the importance of our key accounts for our business is increasing. Consolidation is the result of, for example, mergers, acquisitions and the formation of purchasing groups. In consequence, the number and size of the key accounts increases and so does the average purchasing power they command. They use their leverage to negotiate price reductions or other concessions. This has reduced the relative strength we historically enjoyed vis-à-vis most independent dispensers and resulted, and will likely continue to result, in pressure on ASPs, and may adversely affect our business results of operation.

In recent years, however, some of our competitors have pursued strategies of vertical integration and rapidly expanded their activities in the retail market. This has provided them with direct access to end-users and increased their control over distribution and pricing while reducing the size of the market accessible through independent dispensers. Likewise, horizontal integration of the market through the expansion of franchise and chain distributors has also reduced the independent dispensers market by consolidating dispensers under key accounts. As a growing percentage of the retail market becomes manufacturer-controlled or consolidated under a key account, our access to independent dispensers has decreased. We have made a limited move to forward integrate into the retail market, which generally keeps us out of competition with our key accounts, but may have the effect of limiting our potential customer base because we are not competing for the manufacturer-controlled segment of the market as aggressively as some of our competitors. We are currently exploring our strategic options with a view to defend or grow our market shares and maintain pricing levels, and may take steps to continue to forward integrate in retail markets we consider particularly attractive through bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in the United States. Any such move may involve significant capital expenditures and the intrinsic risks of entering a new market. Further reduced access to the retail market, or a failed pursuit of any forward integration strategy on our own, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Inadequate coverage and reimbursement policies for our products could affect the adoption of our products and our future revenue.,"Successful sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, therefore, is important for obtaining product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace. While hearing instruments, including our products, are not typically covered by public insurance and other government healthcare programs in the United States and other countries, we cannot assure you that we will remain unaffected by cost-cutting initiatives implemented by governments around the world, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the United States, coverage and reimbursement for medical devices vary among payors. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. Some governmental and private third-party payors do not currently cover or reimburse our products. Further, third-party payors who currently cover and reimburse customers for our products may in the future choose to decrease current levels of reimbursement or eliminate reimbursement altogether, either of which will cause our business to suffer. In Germany, coverage and reimbursement for medical devices vary among statutory health insurance funds (“SHIF”) and private health insurance funds as payors. Besides, the individual agreements between the SHIF and the audiologists may contain different reimbursement rates. SHIF insured patients are generally entitled to hearing instruments that are necessary to compensate a hearing loss but limited to a maximum reimbursement amount, which has been increased to €733.59 (excluding VAT) for hearing impaired patients and to €786.86 (excluding VAT) for nearly deaf patients over the last two years. However, as the prices of hearing instruments often exceed the reimbursement rates, the insured have to pay the difference at their own expense. Private health insurance reimbursement rates vary by policy but the reimbursement amounts are typically more favorable for the patients. According to a 2009 verdict of the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”), it is very likely that agreements between the SHIF and the audiologists which are equal to or exceed the threshold of €207,000 (as of now) will be required to be tendered. As a manufacturer of hearing aids, we are not directly affected but our prices could also be influenced by changes in the market strategy of wholesalers or audiologists. In addition, in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably, if at all. In the United States in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. While the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States; established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which included, among other things, reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. We expect that market demand, government regulation and third-party coverage and reimbursement policies will continue to limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

A major part of our revenue is derived under contracts with government agencies, such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, and consequently we are regularly conducting business with public officials and other politically exposed persons. We have policies in place to prevent direct or indirect acts of corruption, bribery, anticompetitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, deception, tax evasion and any other criminal or otherwise unacceptable conduct. However, such policies may be insufficient or our employees may not adhere to their letter and spirit. If any of our personnel is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical acts, or we are found not to have taken effective steps to manage and mitigate the risk or to address allegations or findings, of inappropriate conduct in our business, this may damage our reputation, result in criminal, regulatory or civil sanctions, impair our ability to participate in business with national healthcare providers and insurers and may result in formal or informal exclusions from such business.

Because of the international scope of our activities, we are subject to a number of risks and challenges, many of which are beyond our control. These include, among other things, political, social and economic instability, or corruption; inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in government policies and regulations or difficulty in securing necessary regulatory approvals; difficulties in enforcing ----- intellectual property rights; increases in transportation and other shipping costs; devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates such as the recent fluctuation of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar and the euro; the potential for the nationalization of companies; uncertainties in and the revocation of property titles; tariffs and other trade protection measures; disruptions to operations due to strikes or governmental action such as the recent widespread labor strikes in Indonesia; the inability to collect payments or longer payment cycles; restrictions on the ability to own or operate foreign subsidiaries; restrictions on the ability to repatriate dividends from subsidiaries; and the imposition or increases of price controls or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries. The management of a decentralized international business requires compliance with the legislative and regulatory requirements of many different jurisdictions, including tax rules, employment and environmental legislation. For example, where local tax rules are complex or their applicability is uncertain, compliance with such rules may lead to unforeseen tax consequences. In addition, structuring decisions and local legal compliance may be more difficult due to conflicting laws and regulations, including those relating to, among other things, employment, health and safety, public procurement, competition and environmental protection. Our international sales are also subject to various jurisdictions’ economic sanctions, export control and anticorruption laws and regulations, which increase the risk that we may become subject to significant penalties for violating such laws. As a globally operating organization, we conduct de minimis business with customers in countries, such as Iran, Myanmar and Syria, that are subject to increasingly expansive export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions. New or expanded export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries and in amendments to our policies. Failure to comply with these laws could expose us to civil and criminal prosecution and penalties, the imposition of export or economic sanctions against us and reputational damage.

If we were not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to the market environment, we may experience further adverse effects that may be material to our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in addition to a general decline in demand, the strained budgets of many insurers and national healthcare providers put pressure on them to contain healthcare costs and reimbursement rates. This may make it more difficult for patients to obtain funding and as a result they may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our hearing instruments.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain these customer relations. For example, global contracts representing 10% of our total revenue are up for renewal in 2015 and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing these commercial relationships. Our most important customers consist mostly of public institutions, which procure our hearing instruments for government-sponsored health schemes, and large retailers that sell our products to end-users via their distribution networks. Their sheer size and purchase power, and ability to extract favorable commercial terms, are key characteristics of the members of this customer group. See “— _Accelerated consolidation and formation of purchasing groups by retailers increases the pricing pressure on our products.”_ Additionally, government-sponsored healthcare programs are under increasing pressure to control or to cut costs, which may lead to us having to accept less favorable terms if they elect to renew their contracts. Our commercial relations with the majority of our customers are conducted through contracts that have a typical duration of two to five years. A significant proportion of our contracts with our customers do not stipulate any purchase obligations and can be terminated at short notice. Switching suppliers could be labor-intensive and costly for many of our customers, primarily due to training and productivity costs associated with staff and applicable regulatory requirements, which could require a run-up period of several months.

In addition, we are subject to legislation in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate relating to unfair competitive practices and similar behavior. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to allegations of, or regulatory investigations or proceedings into, such practices.

These proprietary rights are essential to our business. and our ability to compete effectively with other companies in the market is greatly enhanced by the ability to access any successful technology through cross-trading intellectual property rights. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing rights to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in key jurisdictions for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. Our patent portfolio includes approximately 1,800 issued national patents, with an average duration until expiration of 12 years, and approximately 600 pending applications for national patents. However, we may decide as part of our patent portfolio management to abandon patents earlier. We may be unsuccessful in our applications for any pending or future patent applications. Any current or future patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us or prevent competitors from entering markets that we currently serve. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others from competitors or non-practicing entities. Furthermore, we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding intellectual property rights. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third-party’s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted. Such lawsuits could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products, our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and cause damage to our reputation. Any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome, and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, litigation may provoke third-parties to assert claims against us and may put our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of being unsuccessful. We are occasionally subject to patent infringement claims that are made for large amounts of money in an attempt to extort a settlement from us. We actively defend ourselves against these claims as they arise, but doing so can still require significant amounts of our time and result in costly legal defense bills. For example, in September 2008, Vivatone Hearing Systems, LLC (now known as Auditory Licensing Company LLC, or “ALC”) sued us, and several other hearing instruments manufacturers, for alleged infringement of a patent related to a certain hearing instrument. In July 2010, after ALC had been assigned two additional patents of similar nature, several of our co-defendants filed for declaratory judgment in order to prevent ALC from filing a second suit asserting infringement of these additional patents. All proceedings were eventually postponed pending reexamination of all three patents before the Patent Office. Thus far, two of the three patents have been found invalid. In June 2014, ALC filed a Notice of Appeal of the Patent Office’s rejection of the outstanding patent. The litigation is currently pending in the District Court of Connecticut, but all related litigation has been postponed pending resolution of invalidity challenges. While we believe that we will succeed on the claim and do not expect any significant negative effects to our business, the patents at issue are essential to our products, and a negative ruling in this case may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ----- We may initiate litigation to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets and know-how, or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, timeconsuming and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. In addition, we may not prevail in lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. In addition, any successful infringement proceedings may be economically worthless for us if they take too much time and the intellectual property right, or the product developed on the basis of it, becomes obsolete.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Accordingly, our business may be affected by changes in any such laws and regulations and, in particular, by changes to the conditions for coverage, the way in which reimbursement is calculated, the ability to obtain national health insurance coverage, or the role of the ear, nose and throat specialists. While the various agencies that enforce the European Union’s Medical Device Directive, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are the regulatory bodies affecting us most prominently, there are numerous other regulatory schemes at the international, national and sub-national levels to which we are subject. These regulations can be burdensome and subject to change on short notice, exposing us to the risk of increased costs and business disruption, and regulatory premarket clearance or approval requirements may affect or delay our ability to market our new products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain marketing clearance or approval for our new products, or enhancements or modifications to existing products. If we do, such clearance or approval may take a significant amount of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Further, such clearance or approval might involve stringent testing procedures, modifications, repairs or replacements of our products and could result in limitations on the proposed uses of our products. Regulatory authorities and legislators have been recently increasing their scrutiny of the healthcare industry, and there are ongoing regulatory efforts to reduce healthcare costs that may intensify in the future. Our business is also sensitive to any changes in tort and product liability laws. Regulations pertaining to our products have become increasingly stringent and more common, particularly in developing countries whose regulations approach standards previously attained only by some OECD countries, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Conversely, however, the regulation of hearing instruments as medical devices provides a barrier to entry for new competitors. For example, if certain of our products were made subject to less stringent regulation by the FDA in the United States, then products similar to ours might be marketed and sold more freely, and our products may become commoditized. If the markets in which we operate become ----- less regulated, those barriers to entry may be eliminated or reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: - the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act; - the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; - the federal criminal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent; - the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented, a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; - the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating these statutes without actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them; - HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements; - the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period, and manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year; - national accreditation and state licensure and certification requirements, as applicable, for our HearUSA hearing care centers and the audiologists and other healthcare professionals we employ or contract with to provide professional services in such centers; - state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions which generally prohibit lay entities or persons from engaging in the practice of certain professions, including audiology, and the sharing fees received for professional services, such as hearing exams, with non-professional or business interests, respectively. These laws are intended ----- to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the licensed professional’s judgment; - the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections; - the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997, which prohibits corrupt payments, gifts or transfers of value to foreign officials; and - foreign or U.S. state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; U.S. state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and U.S. state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Foreign laws and regulations in this regard may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the countries in which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations vary significantly from country to country. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the reimbursement programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In Germany, such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the fifth volume of the Social Security Code, or SGB V, the state rules for professional conduct of physicians (Berufsordnungen für Ärzte), the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), the Medical Product Advertisement Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz) and the Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz _gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb):_ - both, the SGB V as well as the state rules for professional conduct of physicians, aim to ensure the independence of physicians. In particular, the regulations proscribe to promise, grant, receive or offer any payment or other advantage for the recommendations of physicians as well as the prescription or supply of medical aids or devices; - the Unfair Competition Act prohibits unfair business practices. Thus, infringements of the SGB V as well as the state rules for professional conduct of physicians do not only bear the consequences stated in the respective regulations but also constitute an infringement of the Unfair Competition Act; - the German government is currently preparing a draft piece of legislation that will significantly extend the application of the criminal anti-bribery provisions in the healthcare sector, by making the corruption and corruptibility of doctors in private practice, SHIF doctors (Vertragsärzte) and other healthcare professionals a criminal offence. To date, the applicability of the bribery provisions set out in the German Criminal Code to the healthcare sector is limited. The draft is expected to be published in January 2015; and - generally, the Medical Product Advertisement Act restricts the offer and granting of gifts or other advantages in connection with promotional activities. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, state authorities that enforce state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions may successfully challenge our existing organization and contractual arrangements. A review or action by regulatory authorities or courts in states that have enacted such laws could force us to terminate or modify our relationships with audiologists and other licensed health care professionals or revise them in a manner that could be materially adverse to our business. ----- If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Following the Acquisition, we may continue to use the “Siemens” trademark over the medium term for product sales and service warranties for products sold under the “Siemens” trademark. We believe the value of the Siemens brand name is recognized by our suppliers, customers and potential employees. We will need to expend significant time, effort and resources to establish a new brand name in the marketplace.

The information contained in this offering memorandum has been derived from public sources and, in the case of historical information relating to the Target, has been provided to us by the Target, and we have relied on such information supplied to us in its preparation. Further, the process of implementing the Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial amounts of the Target management’s time and focus, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the business. In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target will not be subject to the covenants described in “Description _of the Notes,” to be included in the indenture.

Any such undiscovered liabilities of the Target, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Target’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, after completion of the Acquisition, additional information may come to light about the Target that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. In conducting our due diligence, we have been required to rely on resources available to us, including public information, information provided by the seller and third-party advisers. There can be no assurance that the due diligence we have undertaken has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise or that such information will be accurate or remain accurate in the period from the conclusion of the due diligence exercise until the completion of the Acquisition. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify material information regarding the Acquisition, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the Target or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, in the event certain risks, which may or may not be identified during due diligence, occur, it may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

If the Completion Date occurs, such counterparties may seek to exercise these rights, which could result in the termination or amendment of the applicable contract. We are still in the process of assessing in which cases consent from the relevant counterparties should be obtained, and are, where this appears adequate from a commercial perspective, seeking the consents of all relevant counterparties in order to continue the commercial relationship with them. In the event of any such termination there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully replace the services or orders that were provided under the relevant contract at attractive prices or at all. Likewise, if we were required to amend any such contract we can provide no assurance that the terms of such ----- amendment will not be materially adverse to us or will not otherwise impact our business or operations. Accordingly, any termination or amendment of a significant contract as a result of the changes of control following the Acquisition could materially or adversely affect our business and ability to provide services to our customers. It is also possible that our material supply contracts could be terminated or amended in other circumstances. In addition, we will need to reapply for certain governmental permits and licenses due to the change of control. If we fail to become a party to a material contract, permit or license that historically has formed part of our business or any such arrangement is terminated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

The Acquisition could diminish this cooperation and we might in the future lose the business opportunities we previously enjoyed because our business partners took into consideration other business opportunities relating to the entire Siemens Group when they entered into business relations with us. We have historically been able to take advantage of Siemens’ size and purchasing power in procuring goods, technology, financing and other services, including insurance, pension plans and legal and audit services. Following our separation from Siemens, we will be a smaller and less diversified company than Siemens. As a separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain goods, technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the separation from Siemens. Further, we can expect to incur costs over the next few years to replace certain IT platforms and services currently provided by Siemens AG (including pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement).

Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory, technical and other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement and our other debt agreements and other agreements we may enter into in the future. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement” for more information, including a description of the financial covenant we are subject to in relation to the Revolving Credit Facility.

Prior to repayment of the Notes, we will be required to refinance or repay certain other debt, including debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations.” We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or repay any of our debt, including the Notes, on_ commercially reasonable terms or at all. This risk is exacerbated by the disruptions in the capital markets that have continued since the last financial crisis and have resulted in tightened lending requirements and in some cases the inability to refinance indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as: - selling assets; - obtaining additional debt or equity capital; - restructuring or refinancing all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity; - foregoing opportunities such as joint ventures or acquisitions of other businesses; or - reducing or delaying our business activities and capital expenditures.

Such laws include financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. Certain of our subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions highly regulated by local central banks or international regulations. In these countries, the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to their parent companies or the Group treasury in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances may be limited. We believe that these limitations have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations. Goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our combined income statement, as well as charges recognized directly in equity, such as actuarial losses, foreign exchange rate adjustments and losses on hedges, if incurred, could potentially reduce our operating subsidiaries’ reserves available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent distributions to the Issuer. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. In addition, various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some cases, prevent the ability of our subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted group. Although the indenture will limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with the Issuer’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will provide the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes when due. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.” The inability to transfer cash among entities within our restricted group would mean that even if the entities, in aggregate, have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from the entity or entities with funds to the entity owing the obligations. In addition, you will not have any direct claim on the cash flows or assets of any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Such subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available to the Issuer for these payments.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”_ In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Guarantees (or any future guarantee of the Notes, if any) may be taken unless (subject to certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement action has been taken with respect to the Guarantors in relation to our senior debt (provided that the Trustee or Security Agent on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes will be limited to taking the same action against that same Guarantor as that being taken in relation to our senior debt); (ii) certain insolvency, liquidation or other similar events with respect to a Guarantor have occurred and such actions are taken with respect to such Guarantor (subject to certain limited exceptions), (iii) there is a default on the Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days (or earlier in limited circumstances) from the date the agents with respect to our senior debt received written notice of such default or (iv) the holders of our senior debt consent to the enforcement action. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Guarantor in a liquidation, administration, bankruptcy, moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding-up or insolvency procedure of such Guarantor, the holders of senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to the Guarantor’s Guarantee. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of senior debt of the Guarantors, including the lenders under our Senior Facilities Agreement. Moreover, certain proceeds received by the Trustee or holders of the Notes must be turned over to the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement to apply for the benefit of the holders of senior debt of such Guarantors. In addition, if a payment default on any senior debt of the Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Notes Guarantee until such default is cured or waived, and certain other defaults with respect to the senior debt entitle the holders of such senior debt to block certain payments on the Notes for a period of 179 days (subject to certain exceptions). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” As of September 30, 2014, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Acquisition, we would have had an aggregate principal amount of €1,060 million of long-term debt outstanding, of which €785 million equivalent would be senior indebtedness (either senior debt incurred by our subsidiaries, debt secured on assets that do not secure the Notes or secure the Notes on a junior-ranking basis or debt incurred by non-Guarantor subsidiaries) and of which €275 million would have been unsecured indebtedness represented by the Notes. In addition, we will be able to borrow up to €75 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, of which we expect to have €30 million to €40 million temporarily drawn at the Completion Date.

Within 90 days of the Completion Date, the Completion Date Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of such subsidiary’s indebtedness and its trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiary before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity and the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets. As such, the Notes and Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries currently represent a sizable portion of Siemens Audiology Solutions’ revenue, EBITDA and total assets and the covenants in the Notes will permit these non-Guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which may also be secured, and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. In the future the revenue, EBITDA and total assets of such entities could increase, possibly substantially.

In the event of liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral securing debt under the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy all, or any portion of, the Notes and the Guarantees. The value of the Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the liquidity of the Collateral, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern and the availability of buyers. No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, our failure to successfully implement our business strategy, competition and other factors. The Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. The shares pledge over Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to such entity because all of the obligations of such entity (subject to the release mechanism in the Intercreditor Agreement) must be satisfied prior to distribution. The proceeds from a sale of Notes Collateral would be distributed to satisfy debt and all other obligations under any debt secured by a pari passu lien on the Notes Collateral concurrently with the distribution of such proceeds in respect of the Notes. The Notes Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the indenture (including additional Notes) and the agreements governing our other debt. Your rights to the Notes Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third-parties enjoy liens (including statutory liens), whether or not permitted by the indenture or the security documents governing the Notes Collateral, such holders or third-parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees that, if exercised, could further reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedge counterparties (and the creditors of certain future permitted senior debt) will have priority over the holders of Notes with respect to the proceeds from the Shared Collateral. Holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Shared Collateral that is also pledged or assigned as security for the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging arrangements (and such other creditors) because such creditors will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral and any distressed disposal with respect to such Shared Collateral, and the Notes will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured creditor ranking pari passu with the Notes. If the proceeds realized from the enforcement of such Shared Collateral or such sale or sales exceed the amount owed under the related financing arrangements, any excess amount of such proceeds will be paid to the Trustee or Security Agent on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes (and any creditors ranking pari passu with the Notes). If there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations under the Notes (and such pari passu debt), the holders of Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such Shared Collateral. See “—Claims of the secured creditors of the _Issuer and the Guarantors will have priority with respect to the_ _Shared Collateral over the claims of holders of the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ As a result of the foregoing, liquidating the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees. We cannot assure you of the value of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding would be sufficient to repay any amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees. If the proceeds of the Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes and the Guarantees, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against our remaining assets.

In addition, even on the expiration of such standstill period, enforcement action against any Guarantor or assets of such Guarantor cannot be taken if at such time the senior secured creditors are taking steps to enforce on collateral granted over the shares in such Guarantor, or any holding company of such Guarantor, and the proposed action by the holders of the Notes might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of the proceeds to be derived therefrom. The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain additional senior debt, and the institutions who are counterparties to certain of our hedging arrangements may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

Each Guarantee will provide holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and Auris Luxembourg I S.A. will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, the indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise limited or ineffective under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantor to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each Guarantee will be subject to certain generally available, and each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, related third-party transactions, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or security provider’s grant of security interests, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was not validly established or authorized or otherwise contravenes the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s articles of association or similar organizational documents; - the relevant Guarantee or Security Documents was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. ----- These or similar laws may also apply to any future Guarantee or security interests granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or security interests were granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee is limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, it is uncertain what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of a relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which has not been declared void. If any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default, or acceleration of the debt, under the Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The source of funds for any repurchase required will be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our subsidiaries’ then existing debt instruments. If we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption— _Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption— _Change of Control,” the indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” in the indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a ----- limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

However, because we are a non-U.S. entity that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, this potential withholding under FATCA applies to interest payments on and gross proceeds from the disposition of the Notes only if we are considered a “foreign financial institution.” Moreover, even if we were treated as a foreign financial institution, the Notes would be “grandfathered” from FATCA unless (i) they are “materially modified” (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after the date that is six months on or after the date on which applicable final Treasury regulations are filed (the “FATCA Grandfathering Date”) or (ii) we issue additional Notes after the FATCA Grandfathering Date that are subject to FATCA and, because such additional Notes are indistinguishable from the original Notes (because such additional Notes have the same CUSIP or ISIN as original Notes), an applicable withholding agent treats the original Notes as also becoming subject to FATCA. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes, including the effect of any current or future intergovernmental agreements between the United States and an applicable nonU.S. government.

However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at the rate of 35% (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). However, during that transitional period, withholding will not apply under the Taxation Directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of that payment authorizes exchange of information instead. The Luxembourg Government has abolished the withholding system with effect from January 1 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive. A number of non-EU countries and territories, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding). On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a council directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. In particular, the changes expand the range of payments covered by the Taxation Directive to include certain additional types of income and establish procedures to look through entities to prevent the circumvention of the Taxation Directive by the use of intermediaries. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from January 1, 2017.

With more than three million units manufactured annually, we believe we are the largest global manufacturer by volume and third largest global manufacturer by revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Our innovative and technologically advanced hearing instruments and complementary diagnostics workflow solutions and service have helped build our marketleading positions in Asia, Europe and North America. We are headquartered in Singapore and employ approximately 5,000 employees. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €690.4 million (an increase of 3.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €156.9 million (22.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) and incurred capital expenditure of €18.8 million (2.7% of revenue). We offer a broad and competitive range of innovative, high-quality hearing instrument products across all price categories and instrument types, serving consumers with varying degrees of hearing loss. Our product portfolio comprises BTE, ITE and RIC devices and related accessories, diagnostic tools and services. Our recent innovations include our micon product family, based upon our proprietary micon technology platform, which has been a key driver of our revenue growth since its launch in 2012, and our binax product family, based upon our proprietary binax technology platform, a binaural hearing system launched in October 2014. We market our products to a fragmented base of over 2,500 customers through multiple distribution channels. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, independent dispensers generated the largest share of our revenue (approximately 37%) followed by key accounts (approximately 29%), distributors (approximately 22%) and public funded healthcare systems (approximately 12%). Our customers include well-known companies such as Amplifon, Audionova and Costco and government agencies such as the NHS, VA and Australian Hearing in Australia. We have a global and low-cost manufacturing footprint. Our serial production of BTE devices is located in Asia, while we manufacture customized ITE instruments at sites closer to our end-users, allowing us to reduce lead times and maintain high customer service. Approximately 2,700 of our employees work in manufacturing, including approximately 1,000 in low-cost countries such as China, Indonesia and Poland.

Our revenue has increased during each of the last three fiscal years in part because we have sold more hearing instrument units than in the respective previous fiscal years, largely due to underlying market growth, the launch of the XCEL platform in April 2011 and the introduction of the micon platform in October 2012. We divide our products into five performance levels—premium, advanced, standard, essential and basic—and vary our product mix in different regions. Generally, we are able to charge adequate prices for our products and offer more ----- technologically advanced products in developed markets compared to emerging markets. France, for example, has traditionally been a “high-end” market for us with a strong share of independent dispensers and purchasing groups.

The majority of our costs are denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Singapore dollars and, to a lesser degree, Japanese yen. Our U.S. dollar costs relate to employee-related costs and marketing and selling costs, especially in the United States. Our Japanese yen costs relate to employee-related costs and marketing and selling costs, especially in Japan. Our Singapore dollar costs relate to costs of manufacturing and employee-related costs, especially in Singapore. As a result of these U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar denominated costs, we are exposed to exchange rate risks. If the euro depreciates relative to the Singapore dollar, this has the negative effect of increasing our costs and decreasing our net income to the extent not hedged.

Between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we increased our revenue in France by €14 million, due in part to higher average selling prices and unit growth following the successful launch of micon. In North America, we increased revenue by €23 million during the same periods, due in part to higher prices and a shift in revenue mix towards independent dispensers. In contrast, we are typically subject to pricing pressure in countries where the government pays for or reimburses all or a significant part of the cost of our products, such as in the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany. Despite this revenue growth, we operate in a competitive industry and face constant pressure to reduce our selling prices, and we expect such pricing pressure to continue in the future. Accordingly, we endeavor to continue to innovate and introduce new products at relatively high ASPs, proactively manage our distribution channels, and carefully manage and reduce our costs in order to maintain operating margins and our competitive position. For example, in 2011 we launched the XCEL platform, followed by micon in 2012 and binax in 2014, each with a full range of product families. Our ASPs are driven by the launch or phasing out of other product platforms, which typically have life-cycles of approximately three to four years, in line with our current business model. New product platforms are launched with higher ASPs, which subsequently reduce after the launch year to further increase units sold before other new platform launches occur. The impact on year-on-year ASPs changes on a group-wide basis is a combination of (i) new launches which have high ASPs and relatively low volumes and (ii) maturing platforms with high volumes and comparatively lower ASPs that account for a higher proportion of revenue in any given year. During the periods under review, we launched a number of new platforms, which helped to improve overall ASPs and improve gross margins. In order to improve our competitive position, we also aim to continuously improve our operational efficiency. During the last three years, our management team has managed and reduced our costs by closing seven ITE manufacturing plants and successfully reorganized our production facilities to: (i) rationalize production capacity, (ii) increase the share of manufacturing in low-cost countries and (iii) increase automation to reduce operating costs and lead times. In addition, our engineering and manufacturing teams also work on various product cost-optimization projects to reduce manufacturing costs and improve supply chain logistics. Taken together, these actions enable us to offer more competitive prices to our customers without affecting operating margins. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to achieve sufficient cost savings in the future because new product lines can initially be less profitable than established product lines given that it can take up to 12 months after product launch to benefit from economies of scale and advertising expenses are often higher during product launch periods. These and other factors could affect our ability to offer more competitive prices to our customers. Our revenue and gross margin also varies according to the distribution channels through which we sell our products. During the periods under review, we enhanced our channel strategy and started to focus more on profitable growth in the independent dispenser segment, from which we typically achieve higher average selling prices, and de-emphasized pure unit volume growth. For example, between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we strengthened our focus on independent dispensers, which resulted in improvement in our profitability. ----- The table below shows how our revenue by channel has changed between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2014.

In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our research and development expenses in our combined statements of income equaled 8.4%, 6.9% and 6.6% of our revenue, respectively. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the additions to capitalized development costs amounted to €2.7 million, €3.6 million and €2.8 million, respectively. _Sales and Marketing_ In order to ensure the successful launch of a new product into the market, we incur substantial expenses for the build-up of the appropriate sales force and marketing tools in the months leading up to the launch and thereafter. Our selling and general administration expenses were €226.3 million, €223.2 million and €229.2 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014. For example, we incurred significant sales and marketing expenses to support the introduction of our micon platform. Because each of our platforms typically has a lifecycle of approximately three to four years, we expect to incur these types of expenses on a regular basis.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

This increase was partially offset by the loss of two contracts, a decrease in the pricing for a contract renewed in Australia and adverse movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and weakening of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. _Cost of goods sold_ Cost of goods sold decreased by €7.2 million, or 2.4%, to €290.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €297.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Cost of goods sold amounted to 42.1% and 44.5% of revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was driven by (i) a more favorable group average selling price due to an improved product mix, with the success of our micon platform, and a higher proportion of sales to independent dispensers, (ii) increased automation levels in manufacturing facilities and (iii) positive movements in foreign exchange rates. These positive developments were partially offset by higher costs for materials for more technologically advanced products such as our micon platform and higher production costs due to strikes in Batam, Indonesia, which required us to hire and train replacement workers. _Research and development expenses_ Research and development expenses decreased by €0.6 million, or 1.3%, to €45.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €46.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Research and development expenses amounted to 6.6% and 6.9% of revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. _Selling and general administration expenses_ Selling and general administration expenses increased by €6.1 million, or 2.7%, to €229.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €223.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to higher marketing costs related to increases in HearUSA selling costs and the launch of new products. Selling and general administration expenses amounted to 33.2% and 33.4% of revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by €0.7 million to €1.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €0.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to gains from settlement of ongoing litigation proceedings with former employees and write-offs for deferred purchase prices for acquisitions that did not meet revenue targets under the purchase agreement. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses decreased by €0.3 million, or 50.1%, to €0.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €0.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. _Interest income_ Interest income was stable at €1.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €1.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. ----- _Interest expenses_ Interest expenses increased by €0.6 million, or 19.8%, to €3.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 compared to €3.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to an increase in interest expense paid to the Siemens Group and increases in interest expenses from pension plans.

Cost of goods sold amounted to 44.5% and 44.0% of revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased slightly as a result of higher outsourcing costs due to issues implementing our ERP system and higher amortization of intangibles due to the ERP implementation and the micon platform, which were partially offset by procurement savings in cost of materials. ----- _Research and development expenses_ Research and development expenses decreased by €8.1 million, or 15.0%, to €46.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 compared to €54.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to one-time costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 related to software consultancy. Additionally, there was a reduction of expenses due to consolidation of our U.S. R&D activities into our German and Singapore facilities, which was partially offset by severance payments in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013.

In comparison, the one-time integration costs were €0.2 million and litigation costs were €4.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The integration costs related to the acquisition and integration of HearUSA and the acquisition of a distributor in Turkey.

For more information, please see note 29 of the Combined Financial Statements. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on a carve-out basis from the Siemens AG consolidated financial statements using the historical results from operations, assets and liabilities and cash flows attributable to Siemens Audiology Solutions and include allocations of expenses, assets and liabilities from Siemens AG. All intra-group balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions between companies comprising Siemens Audiology Solutions and all investments and the respective parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary comprising Siemens Audiology Solutions have been eliminated. _Business combinations_ Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by us is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognized either in net income or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured; subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Uniform accounting policies are applied. Noncontrolling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). After initial recognition, non-controlling interests may show a deficit balance since both profits and losses are allocated to the shareholders based on their equity interests. _Foreign currency translation_ The assets, including goodwill, and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the combined statements of income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The combined statements of cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. ----- _Revenue recognition_ Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Under the condition that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to us and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. In cases where the inflow of economic benefits is not probable due to customer related credit risks the revenue recognized is subject to the amount of payments irrevocably received. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of discounts and rebates and excluding taxes or duty. In case of a right of return, the sale is analyzed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether delivery is considered probable, considering the relevant contractual conditions and other circumstances, as well as historical experience and current forecasts. Only if returns can be reliably estimated at the time of sale is revenue recognized, and a provision for returns is recorded against revenue. In all other cases, revenue is deferred until the right of return lapses or returns can be estimated reliably. We assess our revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if we are acting as a principal or agent. Sales of goods and services sometimes involve the provision of multiple elements. In these cases, we determine whether the contract or arrangement contains more than one unit of accounting. If certain criteria are met, foremost if the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, the arrangement is separated and the appropriate revenue recognition convention is then applied to each separate unit of accounting. Generally, the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. If the criteria for the separation of units of accounting are not met, revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period in which the last undelivered element is delivered. _Research and development costs_ Costs of research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are expensed as incurred. Costs for development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, are capitalized if (i) development costs can be measured reliably, (ii) the product or process is technically feasible, (iii) the product or process is commercially feasible, (iv) future economic benefits are probable, (v) we intend to complete development and to use or sell the asset and (vi) we have sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The costs capitalized include the cost of materials, direct labor and other directly attributable expenditure that serves to prepare the asset for use. Such capitalized costs are included in line item “Other intangible assets” as other internally generated intangible assets. Other development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three years. Amortization expense is included in costs of goods sold. _Goodwill_ Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) that suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit, which is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both amounts. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods if the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. There was no impairment to goodwill in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014. _Defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits_ The entitlements of the defined benefit plans are measured by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered, we consider future compensation and benefit increases, because the employee’s final benefit entitlement at regular retirement age depends on future compensation or benefit increases. The assumptions used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation as of the ----- period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net liability at the preceding fiscal year’s period-end date. The fair value of plan assets and the defined benefit obligation, and thus the interest income on plan assets and the net interest expenses on defined benefit obligations, are adjusted for significant events during the fiscal year end, such as a supplemental funding, plan changes or business combinations and disposals. The defined benefit obligation includes the present value from the effects of taxes payable by the plan on contributions or benefits relating to services already rendered. Current service cost and past service cost and settlements for post-employment benefits as well as other administration costs that are unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs. Administration costs that are related to the management of plan assets and taxes directly linked to the return on plan assets and payable by the plan itself are included in the return on plan assets and are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. For unfunded plans, we recognize a post-employment benefit liability equal to the defined benefit obligation. For funded plans, we offset the fair value of the plan assets with the defined benefit obligations. We recognize the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling, in the line item “Post-employment benefits” or in the line item “Other current assets.” Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses, resulting for example from an adjustment of the discount rate, as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in interest income or interest expenses on the net defined benefit liability (asset) and are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. _Income taxes_ We calculate current taxes based on the profit or loss of the fiscal year and in accordance with local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdictions. Expected and executed additional tax payments and tax refunds for prior years are also taken into account. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income statement, unless related to items directly recognized in equity in the period the new laws are enacted or substantively enacted.

In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2013, Siemens Group management monitored goodwill and performed the goodwill impairment test at the level of the entire audiology business. The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. We generally use discounted cash flow based methods to determine these values. These discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s best estimate of future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value _less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and tax rates.

Both segments are considered to be separate markets, and we operate exclusively in the hearing instruments market. Hearing instruments broadly cover the more traditional BTE products, which fit in the outer ear, as well as ITE products, which fit in the ear canal. Implant technologies require expensive surgical procedures to insert the implant into the bone or under the skin behind the ear. The choice of instrument depends on the type and degree of hearing impairment. Hearing instruments are typically used in cases with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss, where the root cause lies in the cranial nerve, inner ear or central processing centers of the brain. Binaural hearing instruments are designed for individuals with hearing impairment in both ears. In contrast, implants require expensive surgical treatment and are therefore normally used in cases of profound hearing loss. Typically, hearing instruments and implants are used to treat different levels of hearing impairments, and are therefore not substitute products. The following table provides an overview of the various hearing impairment solutions. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

On a BTE hearing instrument, the microphone will be located on the outer hook that goes around the ear. An ITE hearing instrument will have a small microphone on the out-facing surface. - Volume control, which is a switch to control and adjust the volume in various sound environments. Several devices come with an automatic volume control, which can automatically adjust the volume after analyzing the sound levels. - Receiver, which is a small loudspeaker that converts electrical signals from amplifier into acoustic signals. - Program switch, which is a selector function that allows the user to switch between different pre-set programs in the hearing instruments depending upon the environment. - Amplifier, which increases the intensity of the signals from the microphone. Filters modify the sounds, so that only sounds relevant for the user are amplified. - Battery, which provides operating power to the hearing instrument. - Earhook, which holds the hearing instrument to the ear and provides acoustical coupling to the earmold. Earhooks are typically needed for all BTE devices. While the basic components of a hearing instrument are the same, the components used in different hearing instrument platforms vary. The costs of high-end products can be multiple times the price of low-end products, which is ----- typically caused by the different device software, feature set, components, and functionality. As such, profit margins across price segments of a particular platform vary significantly and the highest profit margins are generally derived from high-end products.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

As ASPs decline slightly, growth is driven by volume expansion and replacement of existing hearing instruments. Volume growth is primarily driven by two underlying trends. First, the customer base is increasing due to demographic development and an increase in the prevalence of hearing loss. Second, the currently low usage rates within the hearing impaired population are expected to increase due to a number of underlying factors, such as technological advances, social acceptance, increasing penetration of binaural hearing instruments, improved logistics and distributions of hearing instruments, more affordable hearing instruments and increasingly positive customer feedback.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.1,Market Overview,1129.1.7,Global hearing loss prevalence,"Source: Major consulting firm _Equipment penetration_ Alongside increasing hearing impairment rates, the adoption rate of hearing instruments amongst the impaired population is steadily growing. Social acceptance of hearing instruments usage is a key determinant of penetration rates. As the usage of hearing instruments becomes more widespread in society, acceptance grows, which further increases usage. Other factors contributing to the increase in hearing instruments usage are the increased awareness of different stages of hearing impairment among the affected, improved technology and better provision of access to devices. Penetration rates vary across regions and are driven predominately by differences in reimbursement rates, varying levels of social acceptance and affordability. Based on the report of a major consulting firm, penetration in the United Kingdom, where hearing instruments are fully reimbursed by the NHS, was the second highest globally, at 35% of the impaired population in 2013 and is expected to reach approximately 40% by 2018. In the United States, 2013 penetration rates were at 23%, reflective of the low national reimbursement rates, apart from those eligible for VA. The report also estimates the global penetration of hearing equipment at 24.7% in 2013, having increased from 23.4% in 2008 as shown in the chart below, which offers substantial upside potential for the industry as adoption rates increase further. In particular, there remains a large untapped target market among those with low to moderate impairments, as shown below. As the mindset of patients moves away from the traditional view that hearing instruments are only for those with profound cases of impairment, it is probable that the industry will witness a significant shift in demand from those with less severe cases of hearing loss. Source: Major consulting firm Source: Amplifon In emerging markets, the penetration rate of hearing instruments is much lower than in developed countries. Manufacturers with exposure to emerging markets are expected to benefit from rapidly increasing penetration in these regions. _Binaural adoption_ Improved performance of hearing instruments is driving the increase in the binaural adoption rate, which is expected to increase by approximately 1% every year over the next four years from approximately 39% in 2013 as shown in the table below. The perceived user benefits of binaural usage for those with impairments in both ears include: - better understanding of speech, as selective listening is more easily achieved, allowing the brain to focus solely on the conversation that is chosen to be heard; - improved understanding in groups and difficult listening situations; ----- - localization that allows the individual to determine the direction sounds are coming from; and - superior sound quality and sense of balance due to the increased hearing range with two instruments rather than just one. Historically, the adoption rates of binaural usage have experienced particularly strong growth in key countries (e.g., Germany 16%, France 18% and the United Kingdom 17%, in CAGRs of adoption between 2009 to 2011). Because binaural fitting rates already stand at a high level in some countries as of today (e.g., Germany 76%, France 74% and the United Kingdom 64%), these adoption rates are expected to only moderately influence global hearing instruments market value growth.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Typically, a hearing instrument is replaced by the end-user every five years, which suggests that a share of market revenue is driven by replacement purchases each year. This favorable characteristic provides recurring demand for hearing instruments. _Average selling prices_ ASPs within the hearing instruments industry have deteriorated over the last few years and are expected to further decrease at a CAGR of approximately 1% between 2014 and 2018. On a like-for-like product basis, prices are expected to decrease by 2% to 3% until 2018. This negative trend is partially countered by a changing product mix, leading to a 1% to 2% price increase over the same period. Historically price increases were strongly driven by the effect of digitalization, where existing hearing instruments were switched from analog to digital. Going forward, this effect is expected to gradually phase out. In addition, product types such as RIC have been taking increasing market share and volume. However, due to lower pricing, the RIC market share and volume increase has led to a decrease in overall ASPs. These effects are expected to be only partially mitigated by a changing product mix towards products with higher ASPs. Additionally, pro-active channel management, especially a shift from key accounts to independent dispensers and purchasing groups, and continued investment in R&D aimed at continued product innovation help mitigate the decrease in overall ASPs.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Independent dispensers represent the most attractive channel for hearing instruments manufacturers, both in terms of ASPs and profitability. Key types of distributors are described below: - Independent dispensers—This fragmented channel can be segmented into independent audiologists and larger purchasing groups. The purchasing power of true independent audiologists, which sell on average three brands, is generally weak. Purchasing groups allow independent dispensers to act in a competitive manner, as they benefit from reduced prices, but still allow them to remain legally independent. Independent audiologists are a major distribution channel in Germany and the United States. - Distributors—The market is experiencing forward integration of manufacturers into direct distribution to defend and gain market share. This is true particularly in mature markets, such as the United States, where we have a growing presence following our recent acquisition of HearUSA. - Key accounts—Key accounts have significant purchasing power due to their size. Larger key accounts include companies such as Amplifon, Costco, Audionova or Specsavers. Their overall share of the distribution part of the value chain is expected to remain relatively stable over the medium-term. - Public/tender contracts—Hearing instruments manufacturers submit tenders to supply instruments in some countries. Key entities include the NHS (United Kingdom), VA (United States) and AHS (Australia). In the United Kingdom, the NHS distributes approximately 80% of hearing instruments and is able to use its strong purchasing power to negotiate discounts with manufacturers. - Virtual—The virtual sales channel comprises mail order and online sales channels. So far, predominantly smaller players have focused on online retail. These channels can offer significant upside potential and new opportunities for established hearing instruments players. Despite the ongoing ramp-up of online activities, the current market structure has so far remained relatively stable. For hearing instruments manufacturers, forward integration via the acquisition of distributors exhibits a strong strategy. It allows manufacturers to better position their own products with end-customers and also partially mitigates pricing pressure from the distribution channel. However, the scope for expansion is constrained, as mono-brand stores only possess limited cross-selling potential, and thus limited volume potential. Despite recent consolidation trends, the distribution part of the value chain remains highly fragmented. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Future growth is expected to be slightly higher at a projected CAGR of approximately 5% to 6% between 2014 and 2018. Key growth drivers in the American market are (i) growing penetration rates, especially for end-users with moderate hearing loss and (ii) the baby boomer generation reaching an age of 65 or older, which increases the addressable market significantly. Key accounts remain critical to support market volumes and are expected to drive the ASPs down at a CAGR of 1% between 2014 and 2018. _Distribution channels_ In the United States, independent audiologists are likely to remain the backbone of hearing instruments distribution, with approximately 35% to 40% of market share in terms of total units sold. However, their influence is slightly decreasing due to consolidation led by national chains (e.g., Miracle Ear), OEM forward integration and mass retailer growth. VA distribution volumes are at approximately 20% and are expected to increase from 2014 to 2018, driven by the aging demographic and high adoption rates associated with better coverage for hearing instruments expenses. Large mass retailers and national hearing aid chains control approximately 15% to 20% of market share, which is likely to continue to grow, driven by the roll-out of hearing instruments centers. Other channels include government programs and teaching hospitals, with 5% to 10% of market share. These channels are expected to lose market share, as the consolidation trend continues. The online segment currently is still of limited significance. _Regulatory environment_ In the United States, veterans and people eligible for VA are entitled to 100% reimbursement for hearing instruments.

The market experienced strong growth between 2012 and 2014 (CAGR of approximately 7% to 8%), which was supported by the Any Qualified Provider (“AQP”) initiative, enabling reimbursement for devices provided through the private market. Going forward a growth rate of approximately 3% to 4% is projected as the AQP scheme provides further access to patients through private channels. The high penetration level in the market is driven predominantly by the reimbursement structure, with public institutions (e.g., NHS) providing 100% reimbursement rates (approximately 80% of the UK distribution). _Distribution channels_ Distribution is dominated by the public/tender contracts channel. Going forward, political discussions around increased privatization are expected to reduce NHS volumes. Specsavers, one of the largest players in the private market, was able to establish itself as a ‘high-street’ retailer, leveraging its footprint and position in optician sales. Specsavers is expected to continue to grow, on the back of the shift to provide hearing instruments privately through the AQP initiative. The share of other retailers is projected to decline due to rising competition and the significant market consolidation anticipated as a result of structural shifts from public to private. ----- _Regulatory environment_ The UK reimbursement environment is highly favorable for manufacturers, with the NHS providing full reimbursement for hearing instruments.

New entrants would need significant capital outlay and high levels of technical know-how to compete effectively in this market. In addition, the market only sees a limited threat of substitutes. The threat from low-cost manufacturers remains low, as most of the key players in the market are already producing in low-cost countries. Accordingly, the hearing instruments market is dominated by only six key players who represent more than 90% of the total market value, with the leading manufacturers being largely the same across key countries. The three largest OEMs cover approximately 65% of the global market. According to a major consulting firm, the largest player by value in the hearing instruments market is Sonova, the second largest player is William Demant, and we are the third largest player. Our industry is generally characterized by a high degree of stability with regards to market share. Our market share had slightly decreased in 2010 and 2011, but has stabilized and slightly increased since 2011 after the appointment of our current management team and the successful implementation of a number of strategic and operational initiatives.

With more than three million units manufactured annually, we believe we are the largest global manufacturer by volume and third largest global manufacturer by revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Our innovative and technologically advanced hearing instruments and complementary diagnostics workflow solutions and service have helped build our marketleading positions in Asia, Europe and North America. We are headquartered in Singapore and employ approximately 5,000 employees. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €690.4 million (an increase of 3.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €156.9 million (22.7% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin) and incurred capital expenditure of €18.8 million (2.7% of revenue). We offer a broad and competitive range of innovative, high-quality hearing instrument products across all price categories and instrument types, serving consumers with varying degrees of hearing loss.

Our R&D teams are consolidated at two principal locations in Singapore and Germany.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.2,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.2.1,Highly attractive and resilient market underpinned by strong fundamentals,"We operate in an attractive market characterized by strong and stable growth. Because of the importance of hearing instruments in maintaining quality of life for end-users, the global hearing instruments market historically has been relatively unaffected by macroeconomic factors and has proven to be resilient during the recent global financial crisis. Furthermore, the hearing instruments market historically has benefited from a generally stable regulatory environment and comparatively low price sensitivity of end-users. According to a major consulting firm, the global hearing instruments market has grown in value at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2003 and 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% to 5% between 2014 and 2018, driven by several favorable demographic trends and other factors, including: _Aging population and increasing prevalence of hearing loss_ The proportion of the global population aged 65 and older, of which 35-40% show some degree of hearing loss, has demonstrated consistent historic growth (approximately 3% CAGR between 2003 and 2013) and is expected to increase by approximately 4% CAGR between 2014 and 2018 primarily due to the “baby boomer” generation reaching retirement age and longer life expectancy. _Increasing penetration rates_ According to a major consulting firm, the global penetration rate of hearing instruments is still very low at approximately 25% as of 2013, although it has consistently grown over the last five years driven primarily by a number of socio-economic factors and technological improvement. Consistently growing penetration rates provide a very attractive ----- market opportunity for us. We are particularly focused on increasing our presence geographically in markets and among groups of end-users that have comparatively low penetration rates but high growth potential. In APAC, penetration is particularly low. We believe that manufacturers with substantial revenue exposure to APAC, such as ourselves, will benefit from rapidly increasing penetration in these regions. _Increasing binaural adoption rates_ According to a major consulting firm, the share of users wearing hearing instruments in both ears, or binaural hearing instruments, was approximately 39% in 2013 and is expected to increase by 1% annually, on average, over the next four years. We believe that up to 80% of the hearing impaired population could benefit from using binaural hearing instruments, which offer improved hearing in group environments, better ability to locate speakers and superior sound compared to wearing a hearing instrument in only one ear.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.2,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.2.2,Limited reliance on reimbursement regimes and stable regulatory environment,"While government funded reimbursement programs constitute a very important distribution channel in our market, the level of reimbursement of hearing instruments is generally low compared to other healthcare markets, such as pharmaceuticals. This contributes to the resilience of the global hearing instruments market as decreases in government spending as a result of macroeconomic, political or other factors have a comparatively limited effect on the demand for hearing instruments. In addition, we have a limited exposure to public tenders (approximately 12% of revenue for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014), and we believe that only a small percentage of end-users who purchase our hearing instruments through other channels relies on insurance or government reimbursement regimes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.2,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.2.3,Most profitable segment in the value chain supported by high barriers to entry and limited substitution risk,"We operate in the most profitable part of the hearing instrument value chain, which consists of three groups: (i) component manufacturers, (ii) OEMs such as ourselves and (iii) distributors. While leading hearing instrument manufacturers have consistently shown EBIT margins above 20%, component manufacturers and distributors generally report EBIT margins between 5% and 15%. Our position in the value chain is attractive because (i) component manufacturers represent only a small proportion of the value chain and many components are assembled in-house directly by OEMs resulting in limited supplier risk, (ii) distribution continues to be very fragmented in most countries despite some consolidation in recent years, allowing hearing instrument manufacturers to negotiate favorable terms with distributors (iii) the manufacturer market is concentrated with six players accounting for more than 90% of the market and (iv) there is a limited competitive threat from new entrants in low-cost countries, as leading manufacturers already have a significant production footprint in low-cost countries. High barriers to entry also contribute to a stable competitive environment and resilient margins. The global manufacturing base and high technological capabilities necessary to compete in the hearing instrument market require substantial up-front investment, particularly in R&D for sound processing and miniaturization of components. Our engineering know-how, built up over several decades, and continuous development of new products support the significant barriers to new entrants. In addition, a fragmented distribution channel requires a large and effective sales force as well as deep integration of OEMs with their distribution partners, which cannot be easily replicated. Distributors are closely tied to OEMs through their fitting software, after-sales support, customer service and long-standing relationships. Further, hearing instruments are classified as Class I and Class II medical devices by the FDA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the design, development, testing, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, labelling, advertising, promotion, sales, distribution and post-market performance of such products, and all companies must comply with FDA regulations in order to compete in the United States, which is one of the most profitable markets in the world. Additionally, regulation of the hearing instruments industry generally limits the fitting of hearing devices to qualified professionals, creating an additional barrier for new entrants and new technologies. Finally, there are limited alternatives for hearing impaired end-users. Implants, for example, are more expensive, require medical surgery and are riskier than hearing instruments. In addition, hearing instruments and implants are used for different levels of hearing losses (with hearing instruments covering mild to severe hearing impairments and implants used for profound hearing loss) and are not necessarily considered substitutes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

In addition, we believe we are the third largest manufacturer of hearing instruments on a value basis with an approximately 18% market share of the global manufacturer market in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, which consists of manufacturing and developing hearing instruments and distributing them into various sales channels. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by volume in key markets such as France and Australia. We also believe we are ----- the largest manufacturer by volume in China and India, which are two of the fastest growing hearing instruments markets globally. We believe we are the second largest manufacturer by volume in the United Kingdom and the third largest in Germany. In the last few years, we have managed to significantly improve our market position in North America, where we now believe we are the fourth largest manufacturer and distributor as measured by units sold. We also have leading positions with major independent distributors in various countries such as Amplifon and Costco and national public health institutions such as the NHS in the United Kingdom, the VA in the United States and Australian Hearing in Australia.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.2,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.2.5,Proven performance achieved through industry-leading innovation and structural measures,"In the last three years, we have grown our business and increased our market share due to multiple strategic and operational initiatives implemented by our CEO Dr. Roger Radke, our CFO Marcus Desimoni and our wider management team. After joining the Company in 2010, our CEO and CFO reshaped the entire organization, hired a new management team, drove a new product strategy and started to implement other operational measures that have driven growth and margin expansion. These initiatives addressed the perceived technological gap with key competitors, significantly improved our sales approach and client proximity, established a focus on profitability and capital allocation and rationalized our manufacturing and R&D footprint, thereby enhancing our competitive positioning and financial profile. Renewed focus on developing innovative products has driven our financial performance in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014. For example, in October 2012, we launched a new line of products based on our proprietary micon technology platform, which represented a significant leap in processing power compared to its predecessor platform. Given its feedback cancellation, flexibility in frequency shaping and directional computational capabilities, micon helped us to improve penetration with independent audiologists and improve our ASPs. With more than 1.5 million units sold since its launch, micon has been a key driver of revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In October 2014, we launched our newest and most advanced generation of products based on the binax technology platform, the first technology platform based on binaural hearing. Since its launch, the binax platform has received strong positive feedback by customers and industry experts. We believe that binax is widely viewed as one of the most innovative technologies in the global hearing instruments market due to its automatically adjusting binaural features, optimized wind noise reduction, improved directionality, strong speech/span and direction solutions and low battery consumption. Furthermore, we have improved our sales approach in our key markets like the U.S. and Germany. We have hired new sales directors in both countries. We have adopted a proactive channel strategy focused primarily on the profitable segment of independent dispensers, from whom we typically achieve higher ASPs and thus higher margins, as opposed to our previous focus on key accounts. For example, in Germany, between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we proactively sought to achieve better economic terms on supply contracts with certain large accounts, which resulted in a decline in units in the short term but that was more than offset by higher revenue generated by independent dispensers. As a result of this shift in distribution strategy, revenue from independent dispensers grew from 33% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 to 37% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This shift allowed us to increase average ASPs over the same period, while ASPs in the overall hearing instruments market were generally on a slightly decreasing trajectory. We have also pursued a selective forward integration strategy in the United States by acquiring HearUSA. Since the acquisition, HearUSA has shown strong financial performance. In the last three years, our management team has closed seven ITE manufacturing plants and successfully implemented a reorganization of our production facilities aimed at (i) rationalizing production capacity, (ii) increasing the share of manufacturing in low-cost countries and (iii) increasing automation to reduce operating costs and lead times. Historically, our production was characterized by a high share of manual labor compared to automated processes. However, between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, we increased the proportion of automated production from approximately 14% to approximately 31% of total units produced. The micon platform launched in 2012 was the first platform manufactured in a fully automated production process in Singapore, and we expect the share of automated production to further increase with the new binax platform. We have also consolidated five R&D centers into two in order to achieve higher productivity while still maintaining overall R&D expenses at approximately 7% as percentage of revenue over the last three fiscal years in line with our key competitors. Consolidating R&D centers has increased efficiency by leveraging the synergies inherent in having personnel concentrated in the same locations and facilitating the exchange of ideas among R&D personnel. In parallel, we have invested in improving our technological expertise, such as strengthening our wireless team, and we have developed and expanded our Asian R&D base, which has been a driving force behind the binax development. ----- As a result of strategic and operational initiatives, we believe we have regained market share in some regions such as North America and France and increased revenue at a 3.0% CAGR (6.4% CAGR on a constant currency basis) between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Following the Acquisition, we will continue to be led by our strong management team, which has a proven track record and is well-positioned to continue to drive our strategy.

Serial production of BTE devices is located in Asia, while customized production of ITE instruments is closer to end-users to reduce lead times and maintain high customer service. We have a longstanding presence in Asia where we have concentrated most of our production since the early 1990s. We were a pioneer in our industry in building large scale and standardized production in low-cost countries and now have a significant share of our total manufacturing workforce based in China, Indonesia and Singapore. Further, in 2011, we established a European Manufacturing Centre in Poland for the assembly of ITE devices in Europe, which allowed us to reduce our UK workforce in 2013 and reorganize our ITE production in France in 2014. Having a significant share of production in low-cost countries represents a key competitive advantage for us. We have further improved production efficiency in recent years by increasing the automation share of our production processes. The proportion of units produced in our fully automated manufacturing process reached 31% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, and our target is to increase this going forward. Our management team and shareholders have identified a number of specific initiatives to further streamline our manufacturing operations, which we expect to pursue following the completion of the Acquisition.

(2) Includes Siemens branded product launches only; as of September 2014. “Traditional” BTE units are used for all types of hearing losses, from mild to profound. “Traditional” BTE units consist of a plastic case worn behind the ear and connected to a plastic earmold inside the outer ear. The “Traditional” BTE unit is generally bigger and more visible than other alternatives. A sub-category of BTE units are RIC units, where the receiver is placed within the canal and connected to the BTE unit via a thin tube. Our RIC units offer users the combined benefits of both comfort and discretion and are designed for people with mild to moderate hearing losses, though we also offer RIC units for people with severe hearing losses. ----- ITE units are custom-made instruments, which sit entirely within the ear and are fitted individually based on an impression of the wearer’s ear. Variants of ITE units include full-shell, half-shell, canal, mini-canal and completely-in-thecanal (“CIC”) instruments, which fit completely in the ear canal and are barely visible. ITE units are designed for people with mild to moderately severe hearing losses. Each type of unit offers various benefits and the choice between the units is often decided based on the profile and personality of the customer. We divide our hearing instruments customers into two consumer profiles: those primarily concerned with discretion and those primarily concerned with comfort. The former product range is aimed at customers with relatively high aversions to hearing instruments, typically with mild to moderate hearing losses. The latter product range is aimed at customers who have generally accepted the need for a hearing instrument, typically with moderate to profound hearing losses and who seek ease-of-use and handling, such as more tactile push buttons and larger sizes for customers with dexterity and vision degradation. There is no “one-size-fits-all” answer to hearing loss. The degree of hearing loss, the individual ear anatomy and the user’s individual preferences and lifestyles need to be taken into consideration. With an extensive portfolio of BTE and ITE products for each of these customer profiles that offer diverse functionality, performance levels, technologies and price ranges, we believe that we have a solution for nearly everyone. See “—Current Technology Platforms.” We offer a comprehensive product portfolio of state-of-the-art hearing aid devices comprising BTE, ITE and RIC devices as well as related services and accessories across all price categories. Our product portfolio is geared towards the higher value segment of the hearing instruments market, and revenue from the higher value Premium and Advanced segments accounted for broadly half of our revenue in 2013.

Since being launched, the binax platform has received positive reviews by customers and industry experts. We believe that binax is one of the most innovative technology platforms instruments on the market primarily due to its automatically adjusting binaural features. This platform achieves binaural signal processing via a highly efficient wireless system that connects hearing instruments on both ears and forms a virtual eight microphone network and is fully automatic, which ensures that binaural hearing is achieved without significant increase in energy consumption. Further, we also believe that the binax platform offers optimized wind reduction, improved directionality and excellent speech and span solutions compared to existing products available in the market. We believe that binax is the industry’s first platform that allows customers to understand speech even better than people with normal hearing even in difficult listening environments, such as restaurants, parties, in the car and in the wind. Key features of the binax platform include “binaxSound”, “binaxGuide” and “binaxFocus”. binaxSound offers superior sound quality through a combination of microphone signals from both ears and is supported by binaxFit, which compensates for hearing loss with seamless steering of the binaural features while enabling low energy consumption, and eWindscreen, which offers highly effective wind and noise suppression for distracting and strong background noises. binaxGuide ensures a personal and versatile listening experience as the customer can manually control the spatial focus according to his preference in ambiguous situations. Finally, we believe that binaxFocus enables an advanced level of speech understanding in noisy environments due to its highly accurate directionality and speech focus. Our recently launched high-end binax platform is utilized in five different hearing instrument product families, which include Ace binax, Pure binax, and Carat (A). The Ace binax is one of the smallest, most discreet RIC instruments on the market making it an attractive choice for first time users.

When choosing manufacturing sites, we have focused on low-cost countries that enjoy a close geographical proximity with the markets in which our customers are located. For example, we established the European Manufacturing Center in Poland in 2011, which is responsible for the assembly of approximately 37% of our ITE devices. Our ITE production is a highly customized two-step production process that takes more of the individual customer’s needs into account compared to the BTE production. First, faceplates including electronics are manufactured at our serial production facilities, which are then shipped to one of our 12 local ITE production sites where a customized shell specially designed for the end-user is built locally. The customized shells are produced from the laser scanned ear imprints taken from the user by the hearing instrument dispenser. The customized shells are then assembled with the standardized faceplates from our serial production facilities before final testing and quality engineering checks are completed. After a comprehensive quality assessment, the device is directly dispatched to the customer. The efficiency of this process is enhanced as we are able to use 12 local ITE production facilities to generally ensure fast turnaround times of approximately three to four days.

We use more than 1,750 suppliers, although our top five suppliers account for approximately 30% of our total purchases for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. We generally do not enter into long-term commitment contracts with our suppliers, rather we typically enter into framework agreements as a basis for individual orders. The term of such framework agreements are typically up to three years and in most cases do not contain any firm purchase commitments. Additionally, we rely on various suppliers as the sole suppliers of certain components necessary to manufacture our hearing instruments. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business—We rely on the timely supply of components and products and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations, raise prices or cease to supply us components or products.” We_ procure components on a global basis, which allows us to pool our orders, source many products to low cost countries and improve the pricing that we receive. As part of our outsourcing, we occasionally jointly develop products with our suppliers. In these circumstances, we typically are entitled to a period of exclusive access to the component or technology or, on rare occasions, share the related IP rights. We believe that this is important because many of our component suppliers supply our competitors.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.8,Customers,1241.8.1,,"The overall growth in the hearing instruments market is driven by rising disposable incomes in emerging markets, increasing awareness of solutions for varying degrees of hearing loss, the growing elderly populations in developed nations, increasing consumer acceptance and the rise in usage of hearing instruments among people with a mild hearing loss. Our ability to capture a share of this growth is influenced by our technological innovation, our relationships with audiologist retailers and how well we market and support our distributors who provide direct retail service to the individual users. We segment our distribution channels into four categories, which independent dispensers, key accounts, distributors and public/tender contracts. These distribution channels then sell our hearing instruments to end users. Our sales and marketing approach to each of these distribution channels vary depending on the channel and on the geographic region being serviced by the distributor. The independent dispensers channel consists of fragmented independent retailers and purchasing groups. Independent retailers and purchasing groups generate higher ASPs for manufacturers generally. The independent dispensers ----- channel is the most attractive distribution channel for us and generated 37% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. We believe that the independent dispensers channel is a key area of growth and strategic focus for us. In order to be successful in this channel, we have enhanced our customer-facing activities through offering various workflow solutions and services. See “—Products and Services—Diagnostics, Workflow Solutions and Services.” Our top five clients in the independent dispensers and purchasing groups channel have purchased hearing instruments from us for an average of more than 15 years. We also have worked to leverage our multi-brand strategy to cover a broader segment of the market and we have expanded our offerings to help vendors in this channel expand their business. Contracts in the independent dispensers channel are generally one-off contracts or annual contracts. In recent years, we adapted our channel strategy and started to focus on profitable growth in the independent audiologist customer segment as opposed to unit volume growth. For example, in Germany, between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we proactively sought to achieve better economic terms on supply contracts with certain large accounts, which resulted in a slight decline in units in the short term but that was compensated by a substantial improvement in our profitability from independent dispensers. Our revenue from independent dispensers saw significant growth between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The shift in strategy with independent dispensers has also led to increasing average selling prices between the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The figure below shows our sales volume by channel for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2014. Source: Management accounts The key accounts channel comprises relatively large, increasingly influential retailers that procure hearing instruments from wholesalers and sell them to end-users via their distribution network. Key accounts, such as retailers Amplifon and Costco, possess strong consumer marketing and sales skills and have sophisticated knowledge of end-user buying habits. The key accounts channel generated 29% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The key accounts channel is characterized by steady to medium growth, customized solutions and the need for optimal product and service solutions and we believe that we have a deep understanding of the needs of our customers in this channel. Contracts in the key accounts channel are generally in the range of one to five years and our top five clients in the key accounts channel have purchased hearing instruments and related accessories from us for an average of more than 15 years and accounted for 18% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Although ASPs in the key accounts channel remain under pressure, we benefit from high volumes in these channels and have been able to convert these volumes into sustained overall profit contribution. The distributors channel has recently undergone consolidation by manufacturers, also known as “forward integration”. There is an increasing trend towards forward integration as it allows manufacturers direct access to end-users and provides greater control over distribution and pricing. We entered the retail market in September 2011 with our purchase of HearUSA. HearUSA competes in the high end of the market and focuses on products with high ASPs and gross margins. HearUSA is a recognized leader in hearing care and has partnerships with managed care organizations across the United States. HearUSA administers hearing benefits and provides related products and services to third-party and self-referred ----- clients through its network of approximately 2,000 independently practicing audiologists and hearing care professionals and over 180 company-owned hearing centers. Through HearUSA end-users can have their hearing tested and work with audiologists and hearing care professionals who will help select the appropriate hearing instrument and guide the end-user through the fitting process. HearUSA has a long-standing commitment to enhance the quality of life in the individual communities in which it serves by making a difference through personal care and attention from a qualified, skilled, knowledgeable and experienced staff. Through personal dedication and volunteerism, we advocate for the medical necessity of hearing care and the utilization of products and services that promote better hearing. The public/tender contracts channel consists of large national or state run healthcare providers who order their products based on the results of public tenders. These healthcare providers, such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, have strong purchasing power and are able to negotiate large discounts with manufacturers. Similar to the key accounts channel, the public/tender contracts channel is characterized by steady to medium growth, customized solutions as well as the need for optimal product and service solutions. The public/tender contracts channel requires us to provide a broad product range to fit a diverse patient population and budgetary constraints. The public/tender contracts channel generated 12% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The public/tender contracts channel is typically characterized by high volumes with low margins, but we believe that it is important to participate in it. Our top five clients in the public/tender contracts channel have purchased hearing instruments from us for an average of more than 15 years and account for 9% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.

Our global sales network is organized based on geographic regions and includes (i) EMEA and Latin America, (ii) North America and (iii) APAC. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, our largest markets were EMEA and Latin America, followed by North America, based on revenue generated. We historically operated with few sales representatives and had above average attrition rates, which together led to a non-competitive incentive system. Further, we did not have dedicated teams for existing or new key accounts and only a few established targeted processes with regards to pricing and discounts. However, over the past several years we have implemented a focused sales strategy with clear strategic goals and objectives that has served to add sales representatives, decrease attrition rates, provide for a competitive incentive system and create dedicated coverage teams for key accounts. To actively manage pricing, we have implemented a stringent system of pricing governance. Our key brand names include Siemens, Audio Service and Rexton. We also sell to third parties who market our products under private labels. Each brand that we sell is marketed individually according to both local and global needs. Although we currently sell the majority of our products under the Siemens brand name, we do not consider the Siemens brand to be indispensable for the successful marketing of our products. As part of the process of becoming independent, we are planning to phase out the use of the Siemens brand over time. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—We _may not be successful in establishing a brand identity.” We believe that because the hearing instruments market consists of a_ limited number of market participants and consumer purchases are more influenced by the recommendations of independent dispensers than the brand name, the transition from Siemens to a new product brand can be executed in a relatively seamless manner supported by other brand signals such as the BestSound Technology label.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.25,CERTAIN REGULATORY REGIMES United States,1241.25.1,Regulation by the FDA,"The FDA classifies hearing instruments, including behind-the-ear hearing instruments, receiver-in-canal hearing instruments, and in-the-ear hearing instruments, as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (“FDCA”), as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve or clear pending product applications. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III). This classification is based on the degree of risk associated with the device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Low- and moderate-risk devices requiring fewer controls are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices that pose the least risk are subject only to the general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling and adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), as reflected in the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA’s premarket notification requirements for medical devices. Class II devices that pose a moderate risk are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries, or post-market surveillance. Some Class II devices must also comply with the FDA’s premarket notification requirements set forth in section 510(k) of the FDCA, while others are exempt. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Some, but not all, medical devices require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to commercial distribution in the United States. The type of marketing authorization necessary is generally linked to the classification of the device. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the premarket authorization requirement and can be marketed without prior notification to the FDA. Such devices include air-conduction hearing instruments, which are Class I devices exempt from the premarket notification requirement, and wireless air-conduction hearing instruments, which are Class II devices exempt from the premarket notification requirement. However, some Class I devices and many Class II devices, require premarket authorization from the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application, which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a 510(k) de novo clearance. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive. Currently, each of our behind-the-ear, receiver-in-canal, and in-the-ear hearing instruments commercially distributed in the United States is classified as either a Class I or Class II device exempt from the requirement to submit a 510(k) notification. Our tinnitus masker products commercially distributed in the United States are classified as Class II devices requiring 510(k) notification. _510(k) Clearance_ If not exempted from the FDA’s 510(k) notification requirement, to obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (commonly known as a “pre-amendment device” based on the date the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted), a device ----- which the FDA has reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence may sometimes, but not always, require clinical data. Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. The review period is suspended during the time the additional information request is pending. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an additional FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. _Clinical Trials_ Clinical trials are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require submission of an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device which may be subject to more abbreviated IDE requirements. If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, the patient’s informed consent must be obtained in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product. _Labeling_ All hearing instruments commercially distributed in the United States must comply with specific FDA labeling requirements. These requirements address the labeling of the device itself as well as the User Instructional Brochure that must be provided to all potential hearing instruments recipients. Hearing instruments must be clearly and permanently marked with, among other things, the name of the device manufacturer, the model name or number, and the year of manufacture. In addition, the user instructional brochure must contain, among other things, specific instructions for the use of, maintenance and care of, and replacement or recharging of the batteries of the hearing instrument, information regarding known side effects that may warrant a physician consultation, a warning statement specified in FDA regulations, and technical data useful in selecting and fitting a hearing instrument and checking its performance. _Continuing FDA Regulation_ The hearing instruments that we commercially distribute in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. This includes product listing and establishment registration requirements, which facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We are required to adhere to applicable cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures ----- of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution. We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”) requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA as required under the MDR regulations, can result in enforcement action by the FDA which can include any of the following sanctions: - warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; - customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our products; - operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; - refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products; - withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; - refusal to grant export approval for products; or - criminal prosecution. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the reimbursement programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.25,CERTAIN REGULATORY REGIMES United States,1241.25.2,Other Health Care Laws and Regulations,"The healthcare industry is also subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician payment transparency laws, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. Our HearUSA hearing care centers are also subject to certain licensure, accreditation and certification requirements and state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions. _Anti-Kickback Statute.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully_ solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service, that are reimbursable by a state or federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The AntiKickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. Although, there are established statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that define certain financial transactions and practices that are not subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AntiKickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted statutes similar to the federal Anti ----- Kickback Statute, some of which apply to payments in connection with the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only governmental payor programs. _False Claims Act.  The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing_ to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud through a qui tam action. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. Several states have also adopted comparable state false claims laws, some of which apply to all payors. _Civil Monetary Penalties Laws.  The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity_ that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. _Other Fraud and Abuse Laws.  HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other_ actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. _Physician Payment Transparency Laws.  There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of_ payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”). Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013—December 31, 2013) by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, device manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. CMS made all reported data publicly available on September 30, 2014. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities. _Privacy and Security Laws.  In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the_ federal government and the states in which we conduct our business or in which our patients reside. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Omnibus Final Rule published on January 25, 2013 (all of which we collectively refer to as HIPAA), imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including where a state law imposes stricter requirements than HIPAA. Many of these state laws also differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Under HIPAA, providers of medical services, such as audiologists, can be covered entities, and some of our hearing care centers could be considered to be covered entities under HIPAA. The manufacturing portion of our business may also be ----- considered a business associate under HIPAA. There are therefore risks for our business associated with the potential loss or theft of patient records or other failure to comply with HIPAA’s requirements. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including protected health information (as defined by and as subject to the requirements of HIPAA), other personally identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our customers, payors, and partners. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: loss of access risk; inappropriate access and/or disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this sensitive personal and business information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed and used by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, use, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy and/or security of personal information, such as HIPAA and various state laws. In the event of any breach involving personally identifiable information, we could be subject to fines, regulatory penalties and class action lawsuits. Unauthorized access, use, loss or dissemination of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive information could also disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Any security breach involving protected health information might be considered to be a violation of HIPAA. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights may impose penalties on a covered entity or business associate such as ourselves for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA. Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation, whether the covered entity knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the covered entity’s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. Penalties for violating HIPAA include civil monetary penalties of $100 to $50,000 per violation, up to an annual cap of $1,500,000 per violation. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, the covered entity has specific reporting requirements under the HIPAA regulations. In the event of a significant breach, the reporting requirements could include notification to the general public. Complying with these notification obligations could be very costly and could result increase public awareness of any security incidents that we have experienced, thereby damaging our reputation and adversely affecting our business. In addition, countries around the world have passed or are considering legislation that would impose data breach notification requirements and/or require that companies adopt specific data security requirements. If we experience a data breach that triggers one or more of these laws, we may be subject to breach notification obligations, civil liability and litigation, all of which could also generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. We work closely with third-party payors to ensure that the appropriate products and services are provided to match the allocated coverage and reimbursement levels although our products are not generally covered and reimbursed by government healthcare programs in the United States. In addition, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our results of operations. By way of example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, which is expected to substantially change the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act: - imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States; - established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; - implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and - created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

In particular, our products qualify as general medical devices. Besides, medical devices are assigned to one of three regulatory classes based on the level on control necessary to assure their safety and effectiveness: class I (low risk), class IIa or IIb (medium risk), or class III (high risk). The regulatory framework concerning the commercialization of our products is largely harmonized by EU Directives (as implemented into the respective national laws and regulations of the EU Member States). These regulations aim at protecting the health and safety of users of medical devices and govern, among other things, the following activities in which we and our contract manufacturers, contract testing laboratories and suppliers are involved: - product development; - product testing; - product manufacturing; - product labeling; ----- - product safety; - product storage; - product market access; - product advertising and promotion; - product import and export; - product sales and distribution; and - product performance/effectiveness. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, delays in obtaining market access, product recalls, product seizures, interruptions of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product market access, injunctions, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such regulations are subject to continuous revision, which may entail increased requirements, and, more generally, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulatory oversight throughout the world. In order to commercialize our products, our products, except for certain custom-made products, are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EWG of 1994 as amended (the “Medical",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

General medical devices in Class III require that clinical investigations (“Clinical **Investigation”) are performed unless it is duly justified to rely on existing clinical data. The objectives of clinical investigations are to verify that, under normal conditions of use, the performance of the devices conform to those intended by the manufacturer and to determine any undesirable side-effects, under normal conditions of use, and assess whether they constitute risks when weighed against the intended performance of the device. Clinical Investigations, in turn, require a favorable opinion by the ethics committee as well as an authorization by the competent federal authority, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und _Medizinprodukte). Besides, the German Medical Devices Act contains numerous preconditions to perform clinical_ investigations on human beings.

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.3,Fraud and Abuse,"We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the countries in which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations vary significantly from country to country and include inter alia anti kick-back statutes and regulations on the advertising and promotions of medical devices. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the reimbursement programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of these laws and regulations are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws and regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. _Anti Kick-Back Statutes_ The German Social Security Code (the “SGB V”) and the state rules for professional conduct of physicians, proscribe to promise, grant, receive or offer any payment or other advantage for the recommendations of physicians as well as the prescription or supply of medical aids or devices. Besides, any circumvention of the regulations is prohibited as well. Although these regulations directly refer only to physicians, they may apply to other persons as well if they instigate or assist physicians engaged in the behaviour prohibited. The potential legal consequences of an infringement of these regulations are manifold: the agreement itself is ineffective, the physicians may face professional sanctions, and a hospital may be excluded from the hospital plan. Besides, violations of the SGB V as well as the state rules for professional conduct of physicians also constitute an infringement of the ----- Unfair Competition Act, which prohibits unfair business practices. The violation of the Unfair Competition Act, in turn, may inter alia result in injunctive reliefs and claims for damages. Furthermore, the offering or receipt of payments or other incentives may be subject to criminal sanctions. _Regulations on the Advertising and Promotion_ The advertising and promotion of our products is subject to additional EEA Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. In Germany, the advertising and promotion of medical devices is primarily regulated by the Medical Product Advertisement Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz), which includes numerous prohibitions and restrictions. Inter alia, it prohibits misleading advertising of medical devices and restricts the offer and granting of gifts or other advantages in connection with promotional activities. Besides, the Medical Product Advertisement Act contains further restrictions for advertisements addressing persons other than healthcare professionals. Infringements of the Medical Product Advertisement Act may be punished as an administrative offense, violations of the prohibition of misleading advertisement may even result in one year of imprisonment. Further, infringements may constitute an infringement of the Unfair Competition Act. This may result in injunctive reliefs and claims for damages.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.4,Privacy and Data Protection,"In the European Union, we are subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations; we process data of both our employees and our customers, including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data (the “Privacy and Data Protection Directive”). Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by this Privacy and Data Protection Directive into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws differ significantly by jurisdiction. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or otherwise subject to local privacy laws. The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on a legal grounds set out in the local laws, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected, be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA without an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use sensitive data relating to living individuals (for example our customers’ health or medical information), more stringent rules apply, limiting the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates). We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation. Local laws are amended from time to time, and guidance is issued reasonably frequently by regulators. Any changes in law and new guidance may impact, and require changes to, our current operations. Additionally, on January 25, 2012, the European Commission published its draft EU Data Protection Regulation and on March 12, 2014, the European Parliament formally passed a revised proposal (as currently drafted, the “Regulation”). The current form of the Regulation proposes substantial changes to the EU data protection regime. Unlike the Privacy and Data Protection Directive, this will be directly implemented into the laws of each of the EU Member States, without the need for further enactment. When implemented, the Regulation will likely strengthen individuals’ rights and impose stricter requirements on companies processing personal data. Press reports suggest that this may be agreed as early as 2015, and coming into force in 2017. Significant changes in the current draft of the Regulation include the need for consent to processing to always be explicit, extended information duties, tougher sanctions (as currently drafted, the applicable data ----- protection authority may be able to impose a fine of up to EUR 100 million or 5 percent of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is greater), increased rights of the data subject and a requirement to notify the data protection authority of data breaches of any sort. As the Regulation has not yet made its full progression through the legislative process, it is not currently possible to assess its full impact on our business.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.5,Environmental,"_General_ Our operations are subject to a number of European, national and local regulatory and environmental laws and regulations, dealing primarily with the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. In particular, the manufacturing of our products is subject to permits, authorizations and approvals and we have to generally comply with certain requirements (e.g., emission limits). Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and non-compliance may result in administrative orders, fines or closure of our operations. In particular, the presence of hazardous materials at our facilities may expose us to potential liabilities associated with the clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater, and we could be liable for the costs of responding to and remediating that release and the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release, among other things. Although the legislation applicable to our business is, to a large extent, harmonized in the European Union, Member States may implement stricter provisions into domestic law. Furthermore, additional laws and regulations including stricter environmental requirements may be adopted and could increase our costs or have a material adverse effect on our business. We have not incurred in the previous three fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2013 or 2014, nor do we anticipate incurring in the foreseeable future, material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, the following environmental regulations are of specific importance to our business: _EU legislation on waste of electrical and electronic equipment_ We are subject to EU regulations on electrical and electronic equipment and waste electrical and electronic equipment (“WEEE”). WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content, and if not properly managed, may cause major environmental and health problems. WEEE is subject to diverse EU regulations. The first Directive on waste of electrical and electronic equipment (Directive 2002/96/EC, the “WEEE Directive”) entered into force in February 2003. In order to deal with the fast increasing waste volume, the WEEE Directive was replaced by Directive 2012/19/EU, which had to be transposed into national law of the EU Member States by February 2014. The WEEE Directive provides for the creation of collection schemes where consumers return their WEEE free of charge and separately. These schemes aim to increase the recycling of waste and/or reuse. Manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment have to apply the best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques. Such treatment is to include the removal of certain fluids and selective treatment in accordance with the requirements of the Directive. In addition, producers are required to provide for the financing of the collection, at least from the collection point, of the treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Closely linked to the WEEE Directive is the EU legislation on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. The former Directive 2002/95/EC has been replaced by Directive 2011/65/EU (“RoHS Directive”), which had to be implemented by the EU Member States by January 2013. The RoHS Directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products to reduce toxic and environmentally harmful waste from such products. Substances that, based on the regulations, have to be substituted by safer alternatives are, inter alia, heavy metals such as lead, mercury and hexavalent chromium, as well as flame retardants, such as polybrominated biphenyls. Manufacturers are obliged under the RoHS Directive to ensure compliance with the substance restrictions by a conformity assessment procedure. Electrical equipment that is in conformity with the Directive must as a rule be labelled with the CE marking. _EU legislation on batteries_ The batteries we use in our products are subject to the EU legislation aiming at minimizing the negative impacts of batteries and accumulators on the environment and also harmonizing requirements for the internal market. ----- Directive 2006/66/EC, (the “Battery Directive”), prohibits the placing on the market of certain batteries and accumulators containing hazardous substances in excess of a fixed threshold, such as mercury or cadmium. The Battery Directive provides for an exemption from the strict threshold applying generally to mercury-containing batteries for button cells for hearing aids. However, the exemption will expire on September 30, 2015. The Battery Directive promotes a high level of collection and recycling targets and improvement in the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators, including their recycling and safe disposal. _EU legislation on voltage limits_ The Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC ensures that electrical equipment within certain voltage limits provides a high level of protection for European citizens. The Directive covers all health and safety risks, thus ensuring that electrical equipment will be used safely and in applications for which it was made. Electrical equipment that is in conformity with the Directive must as a rule be labelled with the CE marking. The Directive will be recast in April 2016 by the new Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU on the harmonization of the laws of the EU Member States relating to the making available on the market of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits. It has been issued as a consequence of the New Legislative Framework Decision No. 768/2008/EC (the “NLF Decision”) which allows economic operators to provide one single declaration of conformity per product. In addition, the labeling and traceability requirements are the same for all products. _EU legislation on electromagnetic compatibility_ Directive 2004/108/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (“EMC Directive”) maintains to guarantee the free movement of apparatus and to create an acceptable electromagnetic environment in the European Union. The Directive’s objective is to regulate the electromagnetic compatibility of equipment and to avoid electrical interference by limiting electromagnetic emissions. However, the Directive does not provide for any thresholds, but requires equipment to be designed and manufactured as to ensure that generated electromagnetic disturbance does not exceed a level above which, inter alia, radio and telecommunications equipment cannot operate properly. The EMC Directive will be recast in April 2016 by Directive 2014/30/EU on the harmonization of the laws of the EU Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility. Its major amendments relate to the NLF Decision.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.6,Reimbursement,"The rules for reimbursement of our products by health insurance schemes are not harmonized but vary greatly from country to country. _Germany_ In Germany, upon prescription, patients may request reimbursement for their hearing instruments. A prescription requires (i) a certain degree of hearing impairment, (ii) the patient’s decision to wear a hearing instrument and (iii) the patient’s ability to handle the device. The conditions for reimbursement differ according to whether the patient is insured through the statutory health insurance funds (the “SHIF”) or is privately insured. About 85-90% of the German population are covered by SHIF. _Statutory Health Insurance Funds Agreements with SHIF_ Reimbursement of hearing instruments by SHIF is regulated by the SGB V. Under the SGB V, patients are entitled to hearing instruments that are necessary to compensate a hearing loss. The hearing instruments must meet certain technical standards, which are generally only met by fully digitalized systems. These standards include: (i) a minimum of four channels, (ii) background noise reduction, (iii) feedback suppression, (iv) a minimum of three hearing programs and (v) amplification <75 decibels. Additionally, reimbursement rules require patients to buy their hearing instruments from only those audiologists (Hörgeräteakustiker) who have entered into an agreement with the patient’s SHIF. Exceptions are only permitted if the patient has a legitimate interest. Audiologists must ensure a sufficient, adequate and functional production, distribution and fitting of the hearing instruments. ----- Under the SGB V, SHIF or their associations may conduct a tender process on the provision of a certain amount of therapeutic appliances prior to entering into an agreement with the providers. However, a tender procedure may only take place if it is appropriate; the SGB V provides that a tender process is in general inappropriate for therapeutic appliances that are manufactured individually for a specific patient or for the provision of appliances, including, to a large extent, services. The latter applies to hearing instruments, which need to be fitted individually to every patient and require maintenance and repair services. In 2009, however, the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) decided that the European public procurement law also applies to the SHIF, which should, therefore, generally conduct a public tender process when procuring therapeutic appliances. While the ECJ did not explicitly refer to hearing instruments, it stated that the procurement law also covers agreements on devices that need to be adjusted individually and that require individualized advice. Thus, it is very likely that agreements that are equal to or exceed the threshold of, currently, €207,000 are required to be tendered. As a producer of hearing instruments, we are not directly affected. However, our prices could also be influenced by changes in the marketing strategy of wholesalers or audiologists. _Reimbursement Rates_ The reimbursement amount patients may request depends on the agreement between the audiologists and the SHIF. However, under the SGB V, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband) determines fixed reimbursement rates which must not be exceeded in the specific agreements. Over the course of the last two years, these maximum reimbursement rates were increased to €733.59 (excluding VAT) for hearing impaired patients and €786.86 (excluding VAT) for nearly deaf patients. To be considered nearly deaf, a patient must have a minimum hearing loss of 81 decibels on his/her less impaired ear. Both fixed reimbursement rates do not include aftercare, maintenance or earmold costs. For binaural fittings, the fixed reimbursement rates are reduced for the second hearing instrument by €146.72 and €157.37, respectively. The individual agreements between the SHIF and the audiologists may contain different reimbursement rates. Therefore, in practice, the SHIF reimburse hearing impaired patients for only lower rates, in general €710 to 740 for the first hearing instrument. In addition, many agreements contain a maintenance lump sum of typically €150 and cover the costs of earmolds, which are typically about €30. _Contribution by Patients_ Generally, the reimbursement rates should cover the provision of appropriate hearing aids to patients. However, practically reimbursement rates are limited to certain maximum amounts. As far as the prices of hearing instruments exceed the reimbursement rates, patients are required to pay the difference at their own expense. The SGB V also requires patients (except for those under the age of 18) to contribute 10% of the price for the hearing instrument. The contribution amount must be at least €5, but must not exceed €10. _Private health insurance_ Private health insurance reimbursement rates vary by policy, although private rates are typically more favorable than those provided by SHIF. Private health insurance providers also offer specific supplemental insurance plans for patients already covered under a statutory insurance plan but who desire more favorable coverage for hearing instruments.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.7,Distribution,"_Germany General Distribution Channel_ The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds issues recommendations on the requirements distributors of hearing instruments must meet in order to cooperate with SHIF regarding their personnel, the legal entity, the accommodations and the resources. According to these recommendations, only certified hearing instrument audiologists (Hörgeräteakustikmeister) or legal entities that employ a certified hearing instrument audiologist in each of their stores fulfill the above-mentioned conditions. Although the Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) decided in 2009 that certified hearing instrument audiologists do not have to be in the store permanently, online distribution directly over the internet without the involvement of a local audiologist is still not permitted. ----- The recommendations also set forth certain conditions for stores. In particular, (i) the fitting of the hearing instrument requires a separate room with a maximum noise level of 40 decibels, (ii) a separate desk place for the repairmen of hearing instruments, (iii) a separate desk place for the earmolds, (iv) a sound- and speech audiometer and (v) a measurement box. _Fast-Track Distribution_ Under certain conditions otologists may provide the patient with a hearing instrument by ordering the hearing instrument from a partner audiology firm and customizing it to the individual patient. This practice is commonly referred to as “fast track” distribution (verkürzter Versorgungsweg). The fast-track distribution must meet the requirements of the SGB V. In particular, the otologist must enter into an agreement with a health insurance fund. This agreement may only be entered into if the efficiency and quality of the provision of hearing instruments are not affected. The agreement must stipulate, _inter alia, the services to be provided and the applicable remuneration._ -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical,1241.27.8,,"devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the European Economic Area. The European standard setting bodies, mainly the European Committee for Standardization, have adopted numerous harmonized standards covering a wide range of devices or specific devices or device categories. Compliance with the relevant harmonized standards applicable to a given medical device provides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. The European Commission has adopted various guidelines, consensus statements and interpretative documents aimed at ensuring the uniform application of the provisions of the Medical Devices Directives. In order to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, nonmeasuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an independent and neutral institution appointed by a Member State of the EEA to conduct the conformity assessment (a “Notified Body”). Typically, the Notified Body, during the course of reviewing our product application (design dossier), confirms that our quality system certifications are being upheld through ongoing assessments which are conducted separately and must be in evidence to complete the conformity assessment. Based on the same quality system certifications, we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products. The lawful affixing of the CE mark authorizes us to commercialize our products anywhere within the EEA and in certain non-EEA countries that recognize a CE mark, such as Australia, except for certain types of medical devices. A new EU Regulation on medical devices, which will repeal and replace the Medical Devices Directives, is currently in the legislative process. The legislative proposal of the Commission provides, for instance, for more transparency and a stricter surveillance and vigilance system. The final adoption of the Regulation is still outstanding. _Germany_ The German Medical Devices Act (Medizinproduktegesetz) tranposes the EU Medical Devices Directives into German law. Thus, the prerequisites for the lawful commercialization of medical devices are primarily regulated by the Medical Devices Act (and the ordinances passed thereunder (Rechtsverordnungen), including but not limited to: - Ordinance on Medical Devices (Verordnung über Medizinprodukte) - Ordinance on the Provision of Medical Devices (Verordnung zur Regelung der Abgabe von Medizinprodukten) - Ordinance on Clinical Trials with Medical Devices (Verordnung über klinische Prüfungen von Medizinprodukten) - Ordinance on the Installation, Operation and Use of Medical Devices (Verordnung über das Errichten, Betreiben _und Anwenden von Medizinprodukten)_ - Ordinance on the Identifying, Analyzing and Counteractive Measures (Verordung über die Erfassung, Bewertung _und Abwehr von Risiken bei Medizinprodukten)_ ----- - Ordinance on the Database-Supported Information System of the German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information for Medical Devices (Verordnung über das datenbankgestützte Informationssystem über _Medizinprodukte des deutschen Instituts für medizinische Dokumentation und Information)_ - Ordinance on the Fees linked to the Medical Devices Act and the Ordinances passed thereunder (Gebührenverordnung zum Medizinproduktegesetz und den zu seiner Ausführung ergangenen _Rechtsverordnungen)_ Both, the German Medical Devices Act as well as the ordinances, however, in many parts refer back to the respective EU Medical Devices Directive. Finally, the European guidelines for the medical devices vigilance system (MEDDEV-Guidelines), which are adopted by the European Commission and have been drafted through a process of consultation with various interested parties, are of high practical relevance.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Ltd., Siemens Hearing Instruments, Inc., Audiology Distribution, LLC, Siemens Hearing Instruments Ltd. and Siemens Hearing Instruments K.K. (the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional _Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries_ may provide a Note Guarantee (as defined below) in the future. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - be subordinated in right of payment to that Guarantor’s obligations in respect of any existing and future Senior Indebtedness, including its obligations under the Senior Facility Agreement; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property and assets that secure such Note Guarantee on a second-priority basis (including Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facility Agreement or certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other Indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facility Agreement and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. The Additional Guarantors generated 60% of our revenue and 85% of our EBITDA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and held 66% of our total assets as of September 30, 2014. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—Despite our current level of debt, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes.”_ -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date.

Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.12,Withholding Taxes,21.12.1,Change of Control,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Notes held by any holder to below €100,000. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); ----- (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent, the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agents, at the Issuer’s expense, will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an authenticating agent will authenticate and mail, at the Issuer’s expense (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and in addition for such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders of the Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may also be sent in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with ----- the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control may also constitute a “change of control” under the Senior Facility Agreement (as defined therein), which would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Senior Facility Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document; (2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner (as may be relevant) and made at a time that would enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with the request (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; (3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder or beneficial owner (except to the extent that the Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment made under or with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee; (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax; (6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to the Directive; (7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; (8) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or (9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Notes. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will, upon request, provide to the Trustee and the Paying Agents certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request. ----- If any Payor becomes aware that it is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agents an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit ----- facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than euro is subject to a Currency Agreement covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless (a) in the case of the Issuer, such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms or (b) in the case of any Guarantor, such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment with the Note Guarantee of the Notes; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be_ contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.30,,21.30.1,,"You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer” are to Auris Luxembourg II S.A. only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we”, “our” or “us” are to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Issuer will issue €275 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. and Auris Holding GmbH (“BidCo”), as initial guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as principal paying agent and as security agent (the “Security _Agent”) and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as transfer agent and registrar (the “Registrar”), in a private transaction that is_ not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include the terms of, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the Escrow Agreement and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.” The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to make the Notes Proceeds Loan to Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. will in turn use the proceeds from the Notes Proceeds Loan to make a proceeds loan to BidCo, which will use such funds, together with drawings under Facility B and the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the consideration payable for the acquisition of the shares of the Target and (ii) pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes, entry into the Senior Facility Agreement and the Acquisition. Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated on or about the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Trustee and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). Prior to the release of such proceeds from the Escrow Account, such funds will be invested in certain permitted investments including in cash and/or any highly-rated stable net asset value money market fund. If the Acquisition is not consummated or the other conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), as more fully described below under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” have not been satisfied on or prior to April 27, 2015 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and Additional Amounts, if any. See “— _Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_ Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. and BidCo. Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date and the escrowed funds are released from the Escrow Account, certain of the Target’s subsidiaries will become a party to the Indenture and will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis within 90 days of the Completion Date. Prior to the Completion Date, we will not control the Target or any of its subsidiaries and none of the Target nor any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target and its subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to such entities becoming party to the Indenture. The Indenture will permit the issuance of securities in an unlimited aggregate principal amount and €275 million aggregate principal amount of Notes will be issued on the Issue Date. Following the initial issuance of Notes (the “Initial _Notes”), we may, subject to applicable law and compliance with the terms of the Indenture, issue additional Notes having_ identical terms and conditions as the applicable Notes (the “Additional Notes”) within the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes permitted by the Indenture. Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Initial Notes and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. There can be no assurances, however, that any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S. ----- federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor _Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ The Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

In those cases where the U.S. Obligors’ solvency is a relevant factor, the measures of insolvency will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a party would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due. We cannot be sure as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether or not a party was solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes and the issuance of the guarantees, whether now or in the future by the U.S. Obligors would not be voided or the guarantee would not be subordinated to the Guarantors’ other debt. If such a case were to occur, the guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the Guarantees were incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantors, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one half in number of claims holders and two thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. Subject to specific statutory requirements, a plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed in accordance with the “cram down” provisions of the U.S. ----- Bankruptcy Code, so long as (i) at least one impaired class of claims votes in favor of the plan, and (ii) the plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1242,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES,1242.2,European Union,1242.2.1,,"The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of member states of the European Union. Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) which applies within the EU (other than Denmark), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different member states may have differing and even conflicting views. Furthermore, “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that a company would have its respective “center of main interests” in the member state in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” The European Court of Justice has ruled in a recent judgment that a debtor company’s main center of interests must be determined by attaching greater importance to the place of the company’s central administration, as may be established by objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties. Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office and the management decisions of the company are taken, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, in that place, the presumption, that the center of the company’s main interests is located in that place, shall be irrebuttable. Where a company’s central administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of company assets and existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a member state other than that in which the registered office is situated cannot be regarded as sufficient factors to rebut the above mentioned presumption, unless a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors makes it possible to establish, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. The factors to be taken into account include, in particular, all places in which the debtor company pursues economic activities and all those in which it holds assets, in so far as they are ascertainable by third parties. It is noted in this respect that a revision of the EU Insolvency Regulation is currently pending which may change the above analysis. If the center of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction has jurisdiction to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation, with these proceedings governed by the lex _fori concursus, i.e. the local laws of the court opening such main insolvency proceeding. Insolvency proceedings opened in_ one member state under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other member states (other than Denmark), (save for situation in which recognition of the opening of the insolvency proceedings would be manifestly contrary to a member state’s public policy, in particular its fundamental principles of the constitutional rights and liberties of the individual), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another member state. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one member state (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other member state. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other member state. If the company does not have an establishment in any other member state, no court of any other member state has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligor would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EC Regulation No. 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (“EC Regulation on Insolvency",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1242,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES,1242.4,"Proceedings”), where a company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State of the",1242.4.1,Administration,"The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company or a company with its centre of main interest in England. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve one or more of the purposes of administration specified in the legislation. An English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: (i) rescuing the company as a going concern; (ii) or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than immediate liquidation; and (c) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The administrator must perform his functions in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole. The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, in general no steps may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the commencement, institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if the English Obligor were to enter into administration, the Guarantees may not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without first obtaining the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the permission of the court or consent of the administrator would be given. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator’s powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

There are two forms of winding up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company. The primary ground for the compulsory winding up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in ----- Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary winding up (other than as an exit from administration) is effected by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place operates under the control of the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a creditors’ voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, if a company is in liquidation, any disposition of the company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. When an order is made for the winding up of a company by the court, it is deemed (by Section 129 of the Insolvency Act) to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding up order; the winding up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding up—it is for the liquidator to apply for a stay.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Such a transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was entered into by a company “at an undervalue”, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent, unless a beneficially of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. If the liquidator or administrator can show that the English Obligor has given “preference” to any person within six months of the onset of insolvency (or two years if the preference is to a “connected person”), then the court has the power, among other things, to unwind the preferential transaction. For these purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) and the company takes an action which has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation, is better than if the action had not been taken. The court may not make an order avoiding a preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and was made to shield assets from creditors or otherwise prejudices the interests of a person who may make a claim against the company, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction. An administrator or liquidator can apply to the court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company in the three years preceding the onset of insolvency. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms ----- of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or upon certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles in fair dealing. If an English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). The requirement for the English company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant. The floating charge can be challenged if the relevant company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a ‘connected person’) or two years (if the beneficiary is a ‘connected person’) from the date the relevant company grans the floating charge. If however the floating charge is a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulation 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph as any floating charge created during the relevant period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant. A liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be profitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the English Obligor that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to an executed contract, nor can it disturb accrued rights and liabilities. Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by Noteholders only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued that was unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such German Guarantor, subject to the information presented in “—European Union,” insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “center of main interests” is found to be in a member state other than Germany (please see “European Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the “center of main interests”, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third-parties. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency law of other jurisdictions including in respect of the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex _officio, but require that a company subject to the German insolvency law regime (hereinafter also referred to as the or a_ debtor) and/or a creditor file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des _Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must (subject to the further descriptions in this section “Germany— Insolvency”) be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of_ the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The debtor is over-indebted if its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation value or the going concern value if a sale of the debtor as a whole is likely) and there is no positive going concern prognosis for its business. A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they are due. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the debtor becoming unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor or a right of a creditor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a debtor is a German limited liability company (“GmbH”) (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea — “SE”) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or overindebtedness, the managing director(s) or other authorized representatives or under certain circumstances the shareholders of that debtor must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no later than three weeks after that debtor has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary “debtor in possession” protection scheme unless — from a third party perspective — there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other_ preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. ----- The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called self-administration (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), - revenues of at least €9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “self-administration” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels _Masse)._ Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the Issuer. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a debtor would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of assets of the debtor would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of the debtor after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and - claims against the debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if e.g. they frustrate the ----- election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung) with respect to any of its assets from the assets in the possession of the debtor does insofar not participate in the insolvency proceedings and the relevant asset does not constitute part of the insolvency estate; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (other than to the extent they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims (Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeit) is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has, inter alia, the sole right (a) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., movable assets which are subject to a transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as (b) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignments (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (a) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (b) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceedings (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the (net) disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors whose claims are secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing the claims of creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under a Guarantee granted by the debtors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency ----- dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the various entities of a group or their respective creditors, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency ----- proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as (directly or indirectly) granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction, i.e. the Notes, the Guarantees or security, is successfully avoided, the holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received out of or for the account or to the detriment of the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) (i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of such petition (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form to which such creditor was not entitled or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect); - any transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly (unmittelbar) detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (unentgeltlich) (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted without consideration), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention (Vorsatz) to prejudice its insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act; - any non-gratuitous (entgeltlich) contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly (unmittelbar) operates to the detriment (benachteiligen) of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to act to the detriment (benachteiligen) of its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (a) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and ----- - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as Luxembourg insolvency proceedings) may be opened against the Issuer, Auris Luxembourg I S.A. and Auris Luxembourg III S.à r.l. (together, the “Luxembourg Security Providers” or the “Luxembourg Guarantors”, as appropriate) which are incorporated and have their center of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux) within the meaning ofthe EU Insolvency Regulation in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite); - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite). In addition, your ability to receive payment on the relevant Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a suspension of payments proceedings (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). The following is a brief description of the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. _Bankruptcy (faillite) General Administration of Bankruptcy Proceedings_ The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by the Luxembourg Security Providers or by any of their creditors. Following such a request, the Commercial District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière _commerciale) having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that the Luxembourg Security Providers_ (a) have ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) have lost their commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement _de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on_ its own motion, absent a request made by the Luxembourg Security Providers or a creditor. ----- If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings. The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds. The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the company in place of the directors or the managers, as applicable. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the company’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the company’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the company as well as the creditors collectively (masse des _créanciers)._ The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain the Commercial District Court’s permission for certain acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the company during the bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit restructuring options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs. On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved. _Effects of Bankruptcy Proceedings_ The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Luxembourg Security Providers except i) subject to certain limited exceptions for secured creditors including as provided for by the Luxembourg act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Collateral Act 2005”) and ii) the payment of creditors in accordance with their rank upon the realization of assets. In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu personae agreements). However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’ interest. _Controlled Management Proceedings (gestion contrôlée) General Administration of Controlled Management Proceedings_ The Luxembourg Security Providers, which have lost their commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) or which are not in a position to completely fulfill their obligations, can apply for the regime of controlled management in order either (i) to restructure their business or (ii) to realize their assets in good conditions. An application for controlled management can only be made by the company. The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the company is taken. Controlled management proceedings are only available to debtors acting in good-faith. Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies. The proceedings are divided into three steps: 1. The company must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court can reject the application because (i) the company has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence brought forward by the company does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the company’s business or improve the realization of the company’s assets in better conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of the company. 2. Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the reorganization of the business or ----- the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the company. If the Commercial District Court ascertains that the company is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the company has ceased its payments (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the company will be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de _crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the report by the investigating judge_ or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the company. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the company. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of directors or of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings. 3. The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees. _Effects of Controlled Management Proceedings_ As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the application for controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by privileged creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided for by the Collateral Act 2005. The company may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage, contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge. Once the administrators have been appointed, the company may not carry out any act (including receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the directors, managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et _seq. of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce)). Composition Proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) General Administration of Composition Proceedings_ The Luxembourg Security Providers may enter into a composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) in order to resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement with its creditors, the purpose of which is to avoid bankruptcy. Composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the composition proceedings are not available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The application for the composition proceedings can only be made by the company and must be supported by proposals of composition. ----- The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to prepare a report on, the situation of the company. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether or not to pursue the composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the composition proceedings if the conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire. The composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the company’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights. The composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on claims by the tax authorities, save as specified above. If the application results in a composition arrangement sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the company. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of payment date at six months prior to its judgment. Composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured creditors. _Effects of Composition Proceedings_ The company’s business activities continue during the composition proceedings. While the composition is being negotiated, the company may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any assets without the approval of the delegated judge. Once the composition has been agreed by the Commercial District Court, this restriction is lifted. However, the company’s business activities will still be supervised by the delegated judge. While the composition is being negotiated, creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims. Secured creditors (including secured creditors benefiting from a financial collateral arrangement governed by the Collateral Act 2005) who do not participate in the composition proceedings may take action against the company to recover their claims and to enforce their security. Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the Commercial District Court commenced composition proceedings may be set aside (please see the bankruptcy proceedings section above). _Suspension of Payments Proceedings (sursis de paiements) General Administration of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_ A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis de paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, threequarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned. _Effects of Suspension of Payments Proceedings_ During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the debtor or the debtor’s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by ----- mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Collateral Act 2005. The debtor continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the debtor. When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the debtor’s directors can run the business again. _Judicial Liquidation_ Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the Companies Act 1915). The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “hardening period” (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months (and 10 days, depending on the transaction in question) preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the hardening period at an earlier date; if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by controlled management judgmentunder Luxembourg law, the court may set the maximum up to six months prior to the filing for such controlled management. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for pre-existing debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Collateral Act 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (and the 10 days preceding it depending on the transaction in question) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcyreceiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the hardening period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the bankruptcy receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil Code (action _paulienne) the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent_ payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and a Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Issuer or Luxembourg Guarantor or security provider, as applicable). -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,
367_1,Offerings 2015.md,1242,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES,1242.6,Luxembourg,1242.6.3,Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security,"The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg guarantor to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. Within a group of companies, the corporate interest (intérêt social) of each individual corporate entity could, to a certain extent, be tempered by, and subordinated to, the interest of the group. The notion of interest of group is recognized neither by the Luxembourg law nor by published Luxembourg case law. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary and in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company. A Luxembourg guarantor may give a guarantee provided that the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and is in the best interest of the company. The test regarding the Luxembourg guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that provides the guarantee receives some (direct or indirect) consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee that substantially exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its directors or managers (as applicable) to personal liability. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the directors or managers (as applicable) of a Luxembourg company might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of misappropriation of corporate assets (article 171-1 of the Companies Act 1915). There is no published Luxembourg case law and only limited Luxembourg legal literature in connection with enforcement of guarantees granted by a Luxembourg guarantor for a company of the group (whether downstream, crossstream or upstream guarantees). In addition to the above, it is generally admitted that the granting of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company for the obligations of another group company shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) it must be within the corporate purpose of the guarantor as set out in its articles of association; (ii) it shall correspond to a demonstrable and commensurate corporate benefit received by the guarantor company and (iii) the financial obligations assumed by the guarantor must not be disproportionate to the financial capacity of the guarantor. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis. According to the limited Luxembourg doctrine on this matter, in the event the above conditions are not met, the directors of the company may be held liable and it is only in exceptional cases in which it is demonstrated that the beneficiary was aware of the ultra vires nature of the guarantee or that the guarantee was given with the intent to defraud creditors of the guarantor that a court may void the guarantee itself. In accordance with the principle fraus omnia corrumpit, a guarantee would not be enforceable under Luxembourg law if it is called upon in a manifestly abusive way by the beneficiary of the guarantee. Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of security interests and guarantees in Luxembourg. The conditions to be satisfied by the granting of guarantees/security interests relate to (i) corporate power, (ii) corporate authority, and (iii) corporate benefit. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to specific circumstances, which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. _Corporate power_ Limits on corporate power can either be imposed (i) by law or (ii) by the articles of association of the Luxembourg company. _Limitations imposed by law_ Pursuant to the Luxembourg Civil Code, a Luxembourg company is incorporated with a view to participate in the profits (and the losses) which may arise therefrom. The goal to share the profits is an essential element of every Luxembourg company and therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a Luxembourg company as contemplated by law. A Luxembourg company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are accomplished with a view to the realization, directly or indirectly, of the company’s corporate objective. It is normally understood that except in exceptional circumstances, an intragroup security is a type of act which may serve the purpose of realizing a profit. Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances when there is no reasonable indirect potential benefit of, or a motivated interest for, a proposed guarantee/security to be given by a company, that the validity of such a guarantee/security interest could be challenged for lack of any interest by the guarantor in providing the guarantee/security interest. ----- In addition to this general legal restriction, other limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization (which in the case of a Luxembourg company, does not apply to financial activities within a group of companies) or the limitation on financial assistance to shareholders in the case of subscription or purchase of shares of the guarantor. _Limitations imposed by the articles of association_ The provision of guarantees or security interest by a Luxembourg company must fall under the limits of the corporate objects clause of its articles of association. Should the provision of a guarantee or security by a Luxembourg company be considered to exceed the corporate objects as expressed in the articles of association, the company is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate objects or that the beneficiary could not, in light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact. _Corporate Authority_ When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees/security interests, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. _Corporate Benefit_ The granting by a Luxembourg company of a guarantee or security interest must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which words are a translation of the Luxembourg legal concept intérêt social. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In that context, the concept of a group of companies and group interest may be relevant. In general terms, group interest may justify the issue of a guarantee or the granting of security in favor of a parent company (upstream guarantee) or a sister company (cross stream guarantee), under the following circumstances: - the proposed action must be justified on the basis of a common economic, social, or financial policy applicable throughout the whole group; - the existence of a group should be evidenced through capital links; or - the proposed action must not (i) be without any consideration, or alternatively (ii) break up the balance between the undertakings of the various group companies. To the extent that all companies of the group are asked to bear in a similar way the burden of guarantees or security given for the benefit of the other group company or companies in an equal way, the obligation undertaken by a group company for the benefit of other group companies may be justified. Similarly, if a group company cannot exist outside of the group and is dependent on the group, assistance to other group companies should ultimately result in a benefit for such company. The limit of reasonable corporate behavior is reached when the transaction is exclusively in the interest of the parent company or the other companies of the group, without any benefit, direct or indirect, for the Luxembourg company granting the guarantee/security interest. In certain circumstances the guarantees may be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the relevant company’s net worth. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. There is a limited risk that the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company be held liable if, inter alia: - the guarantee/security interest so provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit deriving from the secured obligations for the Luxembourg company; or - the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the guarantee/security interest granted; or - the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company, the guarantee/security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public). ----- The above analysis is slightly different within a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt du groupe) exists. The existence of a group interest would prevent the guarantee/security interest from falling foul of the above constraints. In order for a group interest to be recognized, the following cumulative criteria must be met and proven: - the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates, the benefit must be proportionate to the burden of the assistance; - the guarantee must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means; - the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective; and - the assistance must be granted for purposes of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis and a subjective fact-based judgment is required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg guarantor. _Security Interests Considerations_ According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or _lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the_ creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such (i) as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, (ii) preferred equity certificates, (iii) bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, (iv) receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, (v) tangible assets located in Luxembourg, (vi) securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, (vii) bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over financial instruments including, among others, (i) registered shares, (ii) preferred equity certificates, (iii) bank accounts and (iv) receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, granted to secure financial obligations. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A registered share pledge agreement must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will _inter alia require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A registered preferred equity_ certificates pledge agreement must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the preferred equity certificates and (ii) registered in the preferred equity certificates’ register of such company. If future registered preferred equity certificates are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will inter alia require additional registration in the preferred equity certificates’ register of such company. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or if he did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he will be validly discharged if he pays the pledgor. For ranking purposes, a bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties; ----- - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction (vente de gré à gré) at normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties. Pursuant to article 20 of the Collateral Act 2005, Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening period against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the opening of insolvency or similar proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Pursuant to article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005, notwithstanding the hardening period as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into on the date of the commencement of a reorganization measure or winding-up proceedings, but after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. In accordance with article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005, the rules of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings are inapplicable where the collateral provider of financial collateral arrangement or similar security interest governed by a foreign law other than Luxembourg law, is established or resides in Luxembourg. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third-party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Except as provided in article 20 (4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a third-party creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor which are subject to such security through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale. Under Luxembourg law, security interests qualifying as financial collateral arrangements under the Collateral Act 2005 may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the beneficiaries of such security interests, a fiduciary or a trustee as a security for the claims of third-party beneficiaries, present or future, to the extent that such third-party beneficiaries are or may be determined. _Registration in Luxembourg_ The registration of the transaction documents with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in _Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that they must be_ produced before an official Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée). In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Collateral Act 2005. The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the transaction documents and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

A judicial manager also has certain powers to dispose of assets of a Singapore Company subject to security interests. However, the judicial manager would (unless there are grounds to challenge the security itself) be obligated to recognize the priority of the secured parties to the proceeds or property derived from the sale or disposal.

The transaction can be set aside if such transaction occurs in the period commencing five years the earliest of: (a) the making of the winding up application; (b) in a case where a provisional liquidator was appointed before the resolution for voluntary winding up of the Singapore Company has been passed the time when the statutory declaration made pursuant to Section 291(1) of the Singapore Companies Act was filed with the Registrar of Companies; (c) the passing of a resolution for winding up; or (d) the making of the judicial management application, and the Singapore Company was insolvent when it entered into the transaction or became insolvent as a consequence of the transaction. Where the transaction was entered into with a person who is an associate of the Singapore Company (otherwise than by reason only of being its employee), the requirement that the Singapore Company was insolvent at the time of the ----- transaction or became insolvent as a result of the transaction shall be presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown. A Singapore Company will be treated as having entered into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if it involved a gift by the Singapore Company, if the Singapore Company received no consideration or if the Singapore Company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by the Singapore Company. There is a statutory defence however, so if the counterparty can establish that the Singapore Company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the Singapore Company at that time, then the transaction will not be set aside. A liquidator or judicial manager may also apply to the court for an order avoiding any action taken by a Singapore Company in the period commencing six months (or two years if the person receiving the preference is connected with the Singapore Company) before earliest: (a) the winding up application being made; (b) in a case where a provisional liquidator was appointed before the resolution for voluntary winding up of the Singapore Company has been passed the time when the statutory declaration made pursuant to Section 291(1) of the Singapore Companies Act was filed with the Registrar of Companies; (c) the passing of a resolution for winding up; or (d) the making of the judicial management application, if that action constitutes an unfair preference to another person.

In order to be successful, it must be shown that the Singapore Company was influenced by a desire to produce the result referred to in (b) above and that, at the time or as a result of the preference, the Singapore Company was insolvent or became insolvent as a consequence of the preference.

(“Siemens Japan”) is a corporation in Japan and subject to Japanese laws and procedures affecting debtors and creditors, such as bankruptcy, corporate reorganization, civil rehabilitation or special liquidation proceedings. Under the Bankruptcy Act of Japan (Act No. 75 of 2004, as amended), a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or any of its directors or creditors if a company is generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due because of a lack of ability to pay or if its liabilities exceed its assets. Under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan (Act No. 154 of 2002, as amended), a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or certain qualified shareholders or creditors if it is likely that any of the grounds for bankruptcy as described above will arise. In addition, a company may file a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings if it is likely that the payment of a debt which becomes due would cause serious impediments to its continued business operations. Under the Civil Rehabilitation Act of Japan (Act No. 225 of 1999, as amended), a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or any of its creditors if it is likely that any of the grounds for bankruptcy as described above will arise. A petition for civil rehabilitation may be also filed by a company if the company is unable to make any payments as they become due without causing serious impediments to the continuation of its business. Under the Companies Act of Japan (Act No. 86 of 2005, as amended, “Companies Act of Japan”), a petition for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings may be filed with a court by any of a company’s creditors, statutory auditors or shareholders if, after liquidation proceedings have commenced, circumstances exist which would seriously impede the carrying out of its liquidation or if there exists any possibility or doubt that its liabilities exceed its assets. In addition, liquidators may file a petition for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings if, after liquidation proceedings have commenced, circumstances exist which would seriously impede the carrying out of its liquidation, and liquidators must file the same if, after liquidation proceedings have commenced, if there exists any possibility or doubt that its liabilities exceed its assets. The court will be required to order the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings at its initiative if, after a special liquidation has been commenced, the court determines that there exists a fact which constitutes a cause for commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings while: (i) there is no prospect of entering into a settlement agreement; (ii) there is no prospect of performing a settlement agreement; or (iii) the special liquidation conflicts with the general interest of the creditors. In any of the insolvency proceedings mentioned above, the company’s liabilities under the Guarantee would, in general, be paid to holders of the Guarantee and creditors ranking equally with such holders in right of payment on a pro rata basis, only after all of its debts that are entitled to a preferred status (yuusen ken) under the insolvency laws (such as employment remuneration claims, expenses of insolvency proceedings and taxes) have been paid. Also, the rights of the holders of the Guarantee will be subordinate to those of secured creditors (tanpo-kensha) who will be entitled to exercise their rights over the company’s assets outside of the insolvency proceedings, although the exercise of such rights by the secured creditors may be suspended upon a special order of the court in civil rehabilitation proceedings. Moreover, in corporate reorganization proceedings, secured creditors will be required to participate in such proceedings, and their rights could be impaired or modified in accordance with a reorganization plan. However, it is likely that claims of general creditors, including holders of the Guarantee, would be subordinated under the plan to secured claims to the extent of the net value of the security interest at the commencement of the proceedings. Under Japanese insolvency laws, no party (including, without limitation, any director of a company) is expressly obligated to file for the commencement of insolvency proceedings in any particular circumstance (except that liquidators are required to file for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings as stated above). However, a company’s directors are subject to general fiduciary duties under the Companies Act of Japan, which may in certain circumstances require them to take appropriate steps, including filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings when a cause for insolvency arises. If a company’s directors do not take appropriate action in such circumstances, they could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities. If, based on a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such bankruptcy proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy (hasan kanzainin) will be appointed to administer the company’s operations, realize all assets belonging to the bankruptcy estate and make distributions to creditors. If, based on a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such reorganization proceedings, a reorganization administrator (kousei kanzainin) will be appointed to take over the company’s operations, assess all assets and liabilities, propose a reorganization plan and, if the plan is approved by a company’s creditors and confirmed by the court, transfer management responsibilities to the new management under the plan. If, based on a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such rehabilitation proceedings, a company’s directors will remain in position (subject to supervision by a court appointed rehabilitation supervisor (kantoku i-in)) to propose a rehabilitation plan and, if approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, ----- execute the plan. If, based on a petition for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such special liquidation proceedings, a liquidator (seisan-nin) will, under court supervision, liquidate all remaining assets and liabilities and make distributions to creditors under a settlement agreement approved by its creditors and confirmed by the court. The issuance of the Guarantee and payments made to the holders of the Guarantee may be avoided in insolvency proceedings (except for special liquidation proceedings) by the bankruptcy trustee, reorganization administrator or rehabilitation supervisor pursuant to their “right of avoidance” (hi-nin ken) as a fraudulent conveyance or voidable preference. The acts that are subject to this right of avoidance include: - any act by the debtor taken with the knowledge that such act will prejudice creditors and the beneficiary of such act was aware, at the time of the act, of the fact that such act will prejudice creditors (except the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations as to the already existing obligations); - any act that (except the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations as to the already existing obligations): - prejudices creditors; - occurs after the debtor has suspended payments or after the filing of a petition; and - the beneficiary of such act was aware, at the time of the act, that the debtor has suspended payments or the filing of a petition has been made, and of the fact that such act will prejudice creditors; - any act that relates to the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations as to the already existing obligations and that; - occurs after the debtor has become unable to pay debts in general and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of such debtor’s inability or suspension of payments by the debtor or occurs after the filing of a petition and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of such filing; or - is not obligatory in terms of the act itself or the time of performance of the act, and occurs within 30 days prior to the debtor becoming unable to pay debts in general and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of the fact that such act will prejudice other creditors; and - any gratuitous act (or act deemed to be gratuitous) by the debtor after, or within six months prior to, either the suspension of payments by the debtor or the filing of a petition. For example, the issuance of or payment on the Guarantee may be avoided if: (i) with respect to the issuance or payment, a company is deemed to have been aware at the time of the issuance or payment that it would be to the detriment of its creditors and the holders of the Guarantee are deemed to have had notice of such fact at that time; (ii) the payment takes place after it have become unable to pay its debts in general, or a petition for insolvency proceedings has been filed, and the holders of the Guarantee are deemed to have been aware of such fact at that time; or (iii) where the payment is not obligatory in terms of the act itself or the time of performance of the act, and the payment takes place within 30 days prior to the debtor becoming unable to pay debts in general and the holders of the Guarantee were aware, at the time of the payment, of the fact that such payment will prejudice other creditors. -----",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at the rate of 35% (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). However, during that transitional period, withholding will not apply under the Taxation Directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of that payment authorizes exchange of information instead. The Luxembourg Government has abolished the withholding system with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive. A number of non-EU countries and territories, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding). On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a council directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. In particular, the changes expand the range of payments covered by the Taxation Directive to include certain additional types of income and establish procedures to look through entities to prevent the circumvention of the Taxation Directive by the use of intermediaries.

This withholding tax also applies on accrued interest received upon disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth. As from 2009, Luxembourg resident individuals acting in the course of the management of their private wealth, who are the beneficial owners of interest payments made by a paying agent established outside Luxembourg in a Member State of the European Union or of the European Economic Area or in certain dependent and associated territories (the “Territories”) in the sense of the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), may also opt for a final 10% flat tax. In such case, the 10% flat tax is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agents. _Non-resident Noteholders_ Under the law dated June 21, 2005, as modified, implementing the EU Savings Directive (the “Law”) within the Luxembourg law, a Luxembourg based paying agent is required to withhold tax on interest and other similar income (including reimbursement of premium received at maturity) paid or ascribed by it to (or under certain circumstances, to or for the immediate benefit of) an individual resident or a residual entity established in another Member State of the European Union unless the beneficiary/residual entity of the interest payments elects for an exchange of information. The same regime applies to payments to individuals or residual entities resident in any of the Territories. The withholding tax rate is 35% as from July 1, 2011. The withholding tax system will only apply during a transitional period, the ending of which depends on the conclusion of certain agreements relating to information exchange with certain non-EU countries. The Luxembourg Government has abolished the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the EU Savings Directive. In each case described here above, responsibility for the withholding tax levied in accordance with the Luxembourg law dated December 23, 2005, as modified, and the Law (or the relevant treaties) will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. In this section, “interest”, “residual entities” and “paying agent” have the meaning given thereto in the Law (or the relevant treaties). “Interest” will include accrued or capitalized interest at the sale, repayment or redemption of the Notes. “Residual entities” include, in general, all entities established in the EU and certain dependent or associated territories other than legal entities, UCITS, and entities taxed as enterprises. “Paying agent” is defined broadly for this purpose and in the context of the Notes means any economic entity established in Luxembourg which pays interest on the Notes to, or ascribes the payment of such interest to or for the immediate benefit of the beneficial owner or the residual entity whether the entity is, or acts on behalf of, the issuer or is instructed by, the beneficial owner, or the residual entity, as the case may be, to collect such payment of interest.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Specific exemptions may be available for certain tax payers benefiting from a particular status. ----- _Luxembourg Resident Individuals_ A Luxembourg resident individual noteholder acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments. See “—Withholding Tax— _Resident Noteholders”._ Gains realized upon the sale, repurchase or redemption of the Notes by a Luxembourg resident individual noteholder, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, in any form whatsoever, are subject to Luxembourg income tax provided this sale or disposal took place prior to or within six months after the acquisition of the Notes. Any gains realised six months after the acquisition of the Notes should be exempt from Luxembourg income tax, except for the portion of such gains corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income, except if tax has been levied on such interest in accordance with the Luxembourg law dated December 23, 2005, as modified. Luxembourg resident individual noteholders acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, may have to include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes (income tax levied at progressive rates and municipal business tax). For Luxembourg resident individuals receiving interest as income from assets used in their professional capacity, the 10% withholding tax levied is credited against their final tax liability. The same tax treatment applies to non-resident noteholders who have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable. _Luxembourg Corporate Residents_ Luxembourg corporate noteholders must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes (corporate income tax and municipal business tax). _Luxembourg Corporate Residents Benefiting from a Special Tax Regime_ Luxembourg corporate resident noteholders who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, (i) undertakings for collective investment subject to the law of December 17, 2010, as amended, (ii) specialized investment funds subject to the law dated February 13, 2007, as amended, or (iii) family wealth management companies subject to the law dated May 11, 2007, as amended, are exempt from income tax in Luxembourg, but are subject to an annual subscription tax (taxe d’abonnement). Thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes. _Taxation of Non-resident Noteholders_ Noteholders who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have neither a permanent establishment nor a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable are not liable for any Luxembourg income tax, whether they receive payments of principal or interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) or realize capital gains upon redemption, repurchase, sale or exchange of any Notes. Noteholders who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are attributable have to include any interest received or accrued, as well as any capital gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with respect to such services.

Unless otherwise indicated, all information contained in this section is based on laws, regulations, practice and decision in effect in Luxembourg at the date of this offering memorandum (as referred to herein, collectively, “Luxembourg Tax Laws”), and as such, may be superseded after such date. Any subsequent changes to Luxembourg Tax Laws could apply retroactively and could affect the continued accuracy of this information. This information does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Luxembourg Tax Laws and Luxembourg tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to invest in, own, hold, or dispose of the Notes and is not intended as tax advice to any particular investor or potential investor in the Notes. You should consult your own tax advisors about the tax consequences of investing in, owning, holding or disposing of the Notes (including with respect to receiving interest on and redeeming the Notes). This information does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality or other taxing jurisdiction other than Luxembourg. The residence concept used below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Any reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des _collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi), as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) generally. Corporate noteholders may further be subject to net_ wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for discussions on FATCA (as defined under “— _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal_ income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a ----- corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in foreign currency that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency denominated accrued stated interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the portion of such accrual period within the applicable taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the stated interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest income on the date such interest is received in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such stated interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.

Any foreign tax withheld from a payment to a U.S. holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of a U.S. holder’s applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If the Notes are not traded on an established securities market (or the relevant holder is an accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special settlement date election), a U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of a Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). Individual U.S. holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” (which includes debt of foreign entities) with an aggregate value in excess of certain thresholds generally are required to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) with respect to such assets with their tax returns.

However, because we are a non-U.S. entity that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, this potential withholding under FATCA applies to interest payments on and gross proceeds from the disposition of the Notes only if we are considered a “foreign financial institution”. Moreover, even if we were treated as a foreign financial institution, the Notes would be “grandfathered” from FATCA unless (i) they are “materially modified” (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after the date that is six months on or after the date on which applicable final Treasury regulations are filed (the “FATCA Grandfathering Date”) or (ii) we issue additional Notes after the FATCA Grandfathering Date that are subject to FATCA and, because such additional Notes are indistinguishable from the original Notes (because such additional Notes have the same CUSIP or ISIN as original Notes), as discussed above under “Additional Notes”, an applicable withholding agent treats the original Notes as also becoming subject to FATCA. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes, including the effect of any current or future intergovernmental agreements between the United States and an applicable non-U.S. government.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substially similar to the Notes. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.” Each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” We and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied, through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may ----- be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and our Structure—There may not be an _active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ Delivery of the Notes was made against payment on the Notes on the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which was ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + 10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following six business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, may currently provide and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory, mergers and acquisitions and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, the Initial Purchasers may, now or in the future, own, acquire or dispose of securities of us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for their own account or for the account of others. We have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain costs and expenses incurred. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International and UBS Limited are each, directly or indirectly, a mandated lead arranger, underwriter and lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement and will receive customary compensation in connection with such roles. Additionally, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, Bangalore Branch, which is a lender under a facility agreement, dated May 19, 2014, with Siemens Hearing Instruments Private Limited, which may be fully repaid upon the Completion Date. Further, UBS Limited provided advisory services to the Seller and each of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Goldman Sachs International provided advisory services to the Investors in connection with the Acquisition.

The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Consequently, a final judgment for a payment rendered by any court in the United States would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. Notwithstanding the preceding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would generally be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a German court, and such German court generally will not investigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including all of the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in contradiction to any such prior judgment; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is final and duly enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction, both according to its own national jurisdiction rules and to the Luxembourg principles of conflicts of jurisdiction and in particular, Luxembourg courts had no exclusive jurisdiction over the case at hand, to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. federal or state jurisdictions rules; - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts in accordance with Luxembourg conflict of laws rules; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene Luxembourg international public policy or overriding mandatory provisions of Luxembourg law; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; ----- - the principles of natural justice have been complied with and the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the defendant had the opportunity to appear and, if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi luxembourgeoise). Luxembourg courts do currently not review the merits of New York judgments even though there is no statutory prohibition of such review. With regards to the enforcement of a judgment through legal proceedings in Luxembourg (including the exequatur of foreign court decisions in Luxembourg), Luxembourg courts as well as a Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée) may require the prior registration with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg of any document if it was to be produced in a Luxembourg court action or presented to a Luxembourg autorité constituée as the case may be, in which case either a nominal registration duty of €12.00 or an ad valorem duty of 0.24% (calculated on the basis of the payment obligation concerned), depending on the nature of the document submitted to registration would become payable. If registration is so required, the Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the agreements and/or any judgments obtained in the U.S. federal or state courts must be translated into French or German. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Luxembourg judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

Any judgment obtained in the United States Federal Courts or the superior courts of the State of New York would therefore have to be enforced by action at common law in Singapore by bringing a new suit. Generally, the following requirements must be satisfied: (i) the judgment is on a matter of substance which is final and conclusive under the laws of New York or the United States (as the case may be); (ii) the relevant Federal Court or New York court has international jurisdiction (as defined by Singapore law); and (iii) the judgment must be for a fixed and ascertainable sum of money. In relation to (i), the judgment must be final and conclusive in that there must be a final determination of rights between the parties. A judgment is not final and conclusive: (a) if it can be re-opened by the same court or if the court can alter its terms or (b) if there is another body, not being the appellate or supervisory body that can override the decision of the said court. With regards to (ii), this would be satisfied if that party was present, or resident in the relevant jurisdiction at the time of commencement of the foreign proceedings, or if that party had submitted or had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the relevant foreign court. In respect of (iii), a judgment must be for the payment of a fixed and ascertainable sum of money, that is, the judgment sum can be derived by simple arithmetical calculation, as opposed to a judgment ordering specific relief such as specific performance or an injunction. The Singapore courts will however not enforce the judgment if the defendant establishes any of the following defenses: (a) it was procured by fraud; (b) its enforcement would be contrary to public policy in Singapore; (c) its enforcement would conflict with an earlier judgment in Singapore or an earlier foreign judgment recognized under the Singapore courts; (d) the proceedings in which it was obtained were contrary to natural justice; or ----- (e) if enforcing the foreign judgment will amount to the direct or indirect enforcement of a foreign penal, revenue or other public law.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws of the United States. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which our Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

As of October 1, 2014, all Audiology Business in Siemens regional companies has been transferred to SAT GmbH or one of its subsidiaries, except for the business in Korea and Brazil. Therefore, for the year presented in the Combined Financial Statements, the Company is not a legal group for consolidated financial statement reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS10 but is presented on the basis of a notional group structure. All of the Company’s principal activities have historically been presented as a Business Unit within Siemens’ Healthcare Sector in Siemens’ Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of Preparation",128.20.3,Combined Financial Statements,"The Company has prepared these Combined Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). The Combined Financial Statements represent the first financial statements of the Company in accordance with IFRS 1.3. The Company prepared the Combined Financial Statements using IFRS 1.D16(a) (“predecessor accounting method”). The Company used the same accounting policies and valuation methods for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements, as those used by the Siemens Audiology Solutions entities for the preparation of the financial statements included in Siemens’ Consolidated Financial Statements, unless such accounting policies and valuation methods are not in accordance with IFRS when presenting Siemens Audiology Solutions as a group of entities independent of Siemens. These accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies. The Combined Financial Statements were prepared on a historical cost basis as included in Siemens’ Consolidated Financial Statements, based on Siemens’ date of transition to IFRS (October 1, 2004). Since IFRS does not provide guidance for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, IAS 8.12 has been used for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. IAS 8.12 requires that the latest pronouncements of other standard setters, other accounting literature and accepted industry practice should be considered. The Combined Financial Statements are comprised of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Company’s legal entities, as well as assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses which are allocated on a specific identification basis reflecting the internal reporting structure of the audiology operations in Siemens regional companies. Charges from Siemens AG or other Siemens entities are only included if they relate to specifically contracted services. All of the Company’s activities are under common control of Siemens and common management of the management of the Audiology Solutions Business Unit. The Company is currently preparing the legal transfer of the remaining audiology operations in the Siemens regional companies to a subsidiary of SAT GmbH. ----- As a result, the Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on a “carve out” basis from the Siemens consolidated financial statements using the historical results from operations, assets and liabilities and cash flows attributable to the Company and include allocations of expenses, assets and liabilities from Siemens. All intra-group balances, income, expenses and unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions between companies belonging to the Audiology Combination Group were eliminated when preparing the Combined Financial Statements. All investments and the respective parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary within the Audiology Combination Group are also eliminated. Invested Equity of the Company represents Siemens’ residual interest in the net asset basis of the Company, including the Company’s cumulative operating results and other items, recognized directly in equity. The Company has historically been managed as a single economic entity and is presented on the basis of a notional group structure. Other than financing services performed by Siemens Financial Services, the Company does not have significant recurring inter-business relationships or significant interdependencies and only limited common facilities with other Siemens businesses. Balances with non-Audiology Group entities of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries, which are directly or indirectly controlled (“Siemens Group”), are disclosed as receivables from or payable to Siemens Group. Until December 31, 2009, SAT GmbH was part of Siemens AG’s tax group for corporate income tax purposes. All income tax payments for the tax group were made and borne by Siemens AG and reported in Siemens AG’s consolidated financial statements. The Combined Financial Statements only include income taxes that were assessed against SAT GmbH as taxable entity and were borne by it and does not include retrospective tax payments and tax refunds related to the time SAT GmbH was part of the Siemens AG tax group. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in thousand Euros (€). Rounding differences may occur in respect of individual amounts or percentages.

If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured; subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Uniform accounting policies are applied. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method).

Under the condition that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. In cases where the inflow of economic benefits is not probable due to customer related credit risks the revenue recognized is subject to the amount of payments irrevocably received. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of discounts and rebates and excluding taxes or duty. In case of a right of return, the sale is analyzed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether delivery is considered probable considering the relevant contractual conditions and other circumstances, as well as historical experience and current forecasts. Only if returns can be reliably estimated at the time of sale, revenue is recognized and a provision for returns is recorded against revenue. In all other cases revenue is deferred until the right of return elapses or returns can be estimated reliably. The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. Sales of goods and services sometimes involve the provision of multiple elements. In these cases, the Company determines whether the contract or arrangement contains more than one unit of accounting. If certain criteria are met, foremost if the delivered element(s) has (have) value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, the arrangement is separated and the appropriate revenue recognition convention is then applied to each separate unit of accounting. Generally, the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values.

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit, which is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. In fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the goodwill impairment test was performed at the Audiology Solution Business Units level within the Siemens Group, since the monitoring of goodwill was performed by Siemens Group Management at this level. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cashgenerating unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both amounts. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods if the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit or the group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.

In addition, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Recoverability of assets is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. If assets do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the impairment test is not performed at an individual asset level, instead, it is performed at the level of the cash-generating unit the asset belongs to. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets or cash-generating unit exceeds their recoverable amount. If the fair value cannot be determined, the assets’ value in use is applied as their recoverable amount. The assets’ value in use is measured by discounting their estimated future cash flows.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,128,GLOSSARY,128.41,Defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits—The entitlements of the defined benefit plans are,128.41.1,,"measured by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the Company considers future compensation and benefit increases, because the employee’s final benefit entitlement at regular retirement age depends on future compensation or benefit increases. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net liability at the preceding fiscal year’s period-end date. The fair value of plan assets and DBO and thus the interest income on plan assets and the net interest expenses on DBO are adjusted for significant events during the fiscal year end, such as a supplemental funding, plan changes or business combinations and disposals. The DBO includes the present value from the effects of taxes payable by the plan on contributions or benefits relating to services already rendered. Current service cost, past service cost and settlements for post-employment benefits as well as other administration costs which are unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs (line items Cost of sales, Research and development expenses, Selling and general administrative expenses) following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs. Administration costs which are related to the management of plan assets and taxes directly linked to the return on plan assets and payable by the plan itself are included in the return on plan assets and are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. For unfunded plans, the Company recognizes a post-employment benefit liability equal to the DBO. For funded plans, the Company offsets the fair value of the plan assets with the benefit obligations. The Company recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling, in line item post-employment benefits or in line item other current assets. In the US, the plan assets are held in a Master Trust, administered centrally by Siemens. Plan assets are allocated to the Company based on the relative fair value of the Company’s DBO. Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses, resulting for example from an adjustment of the discount rate, as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in interest income on the net defined benefit liability (asset) and are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. ----- Countries with major pension plans include Germany and the U.S.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision and measured at the lower of the expected cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract as far as they exceed the expected economic benefits of the contract. Additions to provisions and reversals are generally recognized in the Combined Statements of Income. The present value of the recognized obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment (asset retirement obligations) that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of an asset is added to the carrying amount of the related asset.

Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Company as lessee, are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized in the Combined Statements of Income. Leased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. Leases of assets under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the Combined Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

IFRS 9 introduces a single approach for the classification and measurement of financial assets according to their cash flow characteristics and the business model they are managed in, and provides a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. IFRS 9 also includes new regulations regarding the application of hedge accounting to better reflect an entity’s risk management activities especially with regard to managing non-financial risks. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, while early application is permitted. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group postponed its endorsement advice on IFRS 9. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of adopting IFRS 9 on the Company’s Combined Financial Statements. In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. According to the new standard, revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized ----- when, or as, the customer obtains control of the goods or services. IFRS 15 also includes guidance on the presentation of contract balances, that is, assets and liabilities arising from contracts with customers, depending on the relationship between the entity’s performance and the customer’s payment. In addition, the new standard requires a set of quantitative and qualitative disclosures to enable users of the Company’s Combined Financial Statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11, Construction Contracts and IAS 18, Revenue as well as related interpretations.

In some cases these contracts include multiple elements for which fair values need to be estimated for purposes of determining the amount of revenue, if any, which should be deferred to future periods. Significant judgment is required to allocate contract consideration to each unit of accounting and determine whether the arrangement is a single unit of accounting or a multiple element arrangement. Depending upon how such judgment is exercised, the timing and amount of revenue recognized could differ significantly. Deferred revenue (current and non-current) as of September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and October 1, 2011 amounted to €13,604, €13,624, €10,661 and €11,374 respectively. Additionally, in some markets the customers are granted a right of return. If returns can be reliably estimated at the time of sale, revenue is recognized and a provision for returns is recorded against revenue. The Company has estimated and accrued for the amounts to be returned in the subsequent period. This estimate is based on the right of return policies and practices along with historical data, sales trends and the timing of returns from the original transaction date when applicable.

In fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, Siemens Group management monitored goodwill at the Audiology Solutions Business Unit level and, accordingly, performed the goodwill impairment test at the level of the entire audiology business. The determination of the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The Company generally uses discounted cash flow based methods to determine these values. These discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and tax rates. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.

Such items are allocated on a specific identification basis reflecting the internal reporting structure. However, cash is not allocated to specific business operations but reflected only in the total cash balances of the regional companies. Therefore, the conversion of audiology-related receivables and payables to cash in the regional companies results in changes to the net asset balance reported by the Company. The impact of these changes is aggregated in the position “Other changes in equity” within the Statements of Changes in Equity. ----- For purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, income taxes have been determined as if the Audiology related operations of Siemens regional companies were separate tax-paying entities and therefore tax expenses have been computed on a stand-alone basis for each operation of the Siemens regional companies. As income taxes are levied on regional company level, income tax expense determined for Audiology operations within regional companies are reported as a respective withdrawal or contribution are aggregated in the position “Other changes in equity” within the Statements of Changes in Equity. Management considers that such a method is reasonable, but not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company were a stand-alone tax-paying entity.

The growth rates applied in the annual impairment test were 2.2% in fiscal year 2014, 1.9% in fiscal year 2013 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2012, and after-tax discount rates were 7.0% in fiscal year 2014, 7.5% in fiscal year 2013, and 7.5% in fiscal year 2012, respectively. For the purpose of estimating the fair value less costs to sell, cash flows were projected based on past experience, actual operating results and management’s best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions for the 5 year planning period. The inputs used to determine the fair value of goodwill are assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the specific risks and are based on the weighted average cost of capital. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and trends in the industry.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Additions to Software and other intangible assets relating to the ERP amounted to €9,770 in fiscal year 2012. The ERP system has an estimated useful life of 10 years. Other ERP related software has an estimated useful life of three years. Additions to Capitalized development cost during fiscal year 2014 primarily relate to the development of the D9 product platform and during fiscal year 2013 primarily relate to the development of the Micon/D8 and D9 platforms. The Micon/D8 platform was launched in fiscal year 2013 and the D9 platform during fiscal year 2014. Capitalized development costs generally have an estimated useful life of three years. Customer relationships, trademarks, patents and similar rights consist primarily of customer relationships and a trademark related to the acquisition of HearUSA in 2011. These customer relationships are amortized over 7 years and the carrying amounts as of September 30, 2014, 2013, 2012 and October 1, 2011 were €11,828, €13,834, €17,388 and €19,464, respectively. The trademark HearUSA has been determined to have an indefinite useful life as it is the brand under which the Company operates in the US retail market as a whole rather than being linked to specific products. The carrying value of this asset as of September 30, 2014 was €9,590. Amortization of Software and other intangibles is primarily related to the amortization of the ERP system amounting to €2,146 in fiscal year 2014 (Fiscal year 2013: €3,249, Fiscal year 2012: €9,069). The decline in amortization during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 is primarily related to an increase in the expected useful life of the Company’s existing ERP in December 2012. The useful life was adjusted as a result of delays in the implementation of the new ERP system. Amortization and impairment on intangible assets is contained in line items Cost of sales, Research and development expenses or, Selling and general administrative expenses, depending on the use of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized on intangible assets in any fiscal year. As of September 30, 2014 contractual commitments for purchases of intangible assets amount to €1,254 (September 30, 2013: €105, September 30, 2012: €5,285 and October 1, 2011: €53).

Post-employment benefits,128.109.2,Germany:,"In Germany, the Company provides pension benefits through the cash-balance plan BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of the active employees in Germany participate in the BSAV introduced in fiscal 2004. These benefits are predominantly based on contributions made by the Company and returns earned on such contributions, subject to a minimum return guaranteed. In general, the BSAV is unfunded from the Company’s perspective. Nevertheless, Siemens AG as the parent company set up a CTA (contractual trust arrangement) in order to take precautions of financing all of its BSAV pension obligations, including the Company. Individual benefits under the frozen legacy plans are based on eligible compensation levels or ranking within the Company’s hierarchy and years of service. In connection with the implementation of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases by freezing the accretion of benefits under the majority of these plans. However, these frozen plans still expose to the Company actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. Furthermore, deferred compensation plans are offered which are funded via a CTA. In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply. The Trust which is legally separate manages its plan assets as trustee in accordance with the respective trust agreements.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

Post-employment benefits,128.109.3,U.S.:,"The assets under these pension plans are administered centrally by Siemens and are, therefore, the sole responsibility of Siemens. The assets are not separately identifiable; instead the companies had a common right to the trusts’ assets. One major defined benefit plan, the Siemens Pension Plan, is frozen to new entrants and accretion of new benefits. Employees hired prior to April 1, 2006 participate in the Siemens Pension Plan. Most of the defined benefit plan participants’ benefits are calculated using a cash balance formula; although a small group of participants are eligible for a benefit based on a final average pay formula. This frozen defined benefit plan exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. The defined benefit plan assets are held in a Master Trust. Siemens Corporation, as the sponsoring employer, has delegated investment oversight of the plans’ assets to the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee members have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of the beneficiaries according to the trust agreement and U.S. law. The Committee has established an Investment Policy Statement which articulates the goals and objectives of the plans’ investment management, including diversifying the assets of the Master Trust with the intention of appropriately addressing concentration risks. The trustee of the Master Trust acts only by direction of the Investment Committee. It is responsible for the safekeeping of the trust, but generally has no decision making authority over the plan assets. The legal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the applicable U.S. legislation Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Based on this legislation a funding valuation is prepared annually. There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions.

This policy is part of the overall commitment to sound financial management, which also includes an ongoing analysis of the structure of its defined benefit liabilities. To balance return and risk, a benefit risk management concept has been developed. A decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of the adverse development of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations has been identified as a major risk. Monitoring the investments and the defined benefit obligations has been identified as an appropriate risk measure. The risk quantifies the expected maximum decline in the principle plans’ funded status for a given confidence level over a given time horizon. A risk limit on the group level forms the basis for the determination of the investment strategy, i.e. the strategic asset class allocation of principle plan assets and the degree of interest rate risk hedging. Both the risk limit and investment strategy are regularly reviewed with the participation of senior external experts of the international asset management and insurance industry to allow for an integral view on plan assets and benefit liabilities. Siemens AG selects asset managers based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and subsequently constantly monitors their performance and risk, both on a stand-alone basis, and in the broader portfolio ----- context. Siemens AG reviews the asset allocation of each plan in light of the duration of the related benefit liabilities and analyzes trends and events that may affect asset values in order to inform about appropriate measures at a very early stage. Derivatives are used for risk reducing purposes to either reduce the fluctuations in the value of plan assets or reduce funded status volatility as part of an integrated risk management approach for assets and liabilities. Main risks mitigated are interest rate, credit, equity, currency and inflation risk. All over-the-counter derivatives are collateralized on a daily basis to eliminate counterparty risk. In addition, derivatives are permitted for investment managers to use as substitutes for traditional securities where appropriate to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

That means for example, that the life expectancy of a 55 years old male Audiology employee as of September 30, 2014 increases by approximately 1 year. In order to determine the longevity sensitivity the mortality rates were reduced by 10% for all beneficiaries. The effect on DBO as of September 30, 2014 due to a 10% reduction in mortality rates would result in an increase of €1,762 (2013: €1,560). When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the post-employment benefit obligation recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Increases and decreases in the discount rate, rate of compensation increase, rate of pension progression and mortality rates which are used in determining the DBO do not have a symmetrical effect on the DBO primarily due to the compound interest effect created when determining the net present value of the future benefit. If more than one of the assumptions is changed simultaneously, the combined impact due to the changes would not necessarily be the same as the sum of the individual effects due to the changes. Furthermore, the sensitivities reflect a change in the DBO only for a change in the assumptions in this specific magnitude, i.e. 0.5%. If the assumptions change at a different level, the effect on the DBO is not necessarily in a linear relation.",,as_expected,2015,350,,,,

SHI exercised this option by serving break notice in 2013 and vacated the premises. An external law firm had been requested to prepare the break notice. Friends Life argues the break notice was invalid as it was not given in the form required under the lease agreement and the lease agreement would continue for another 10 years. The High Court of Justice decided in July 2013 that not strictly following the prescribed form does not render the break notice invalid. In the subsequent appeal by the landlord the Court of Appeal in April 2014 took the view that failure to strictly follow the contractual requirements rendered the break notice invalid. SHI is currently awaiting decision of the Supreme Court on its application for permission to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. As of September 30, 2014, the Company has accrued €578 (September 30, 2013: €1,054) for the related risk, excluding the impact of claims against the external law firm.

The Company employs various strategies discussed below involving the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate or eliminate certain of those exposures. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may create unwanted and unpredictable earnings and cash flow volatility. The Company manufactures most of its products at its subsidiary, Siemens Medical Instruments, in Singapore. The products are sold to its regional entities and invoiced in the currency of the receiving entities, mostly in € and USD. As most of the material cost are also € and USD denominated, the Company is able to significantly reduce its net currency exposure. The Company’s entities are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. Intercompany financing or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis. The Company is currently integrated in Siemens Group’s foreign currency exchange rate risk management system. Each of the Company’s entities is responsible for recording, assessing, monitoring, reporting and hedging its foreign currency transaction exposure. The binding guideline for Siemens’ operating units provides the concept for the identification and determination of a single net foreign currency position for each unit and commits the units to hedge this aggregated position within a narrow band of at least 75% but no more than 100% of their net foreign currency position. The Company assesses its foreign currency exposure by considering balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies and uncompleted contracts regardless of tenure. In respect of forecast sales and planned purchases, in general the following twelve months are considered or case-by-case longer periods based on highly probably cash flow projections considering historical data and specific commitments from contracts. The Company manages the net foreign currency exposures by either designating derivative financial instruments to specific transactions under the cash flow hedge model or elect to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure. Hedging transactions are carried out primarily with Siemens Treasury as counterparty, except for cases where it is not permitted under country specific regulations. _Sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk_ The following table demonstrates the approximate change in the Company’s profit or loss in response to a 5% weakening of the € against the foreign currencies to which the Company has significant exposure at the balance sheet date.

The Company may incur losses if the credit quality of its customers deteriorates or if they default on their payment obligations to the Company. The Company’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. The Company has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. This includes the review of individual receivables and of individual customer creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis as well as the review of current economic trends, the analysis of historical bad debts on a portfolio basis and the considers country credit ratings. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Company does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are generally only allowed with Siemens Treasury to minimize credit risk. There were no significant concentrations of credit risk as of September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 or October 1, 2011. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.

367_1,Offerings 2015.md,128,GLOSSARY,128.166,Report on the Combined Financial Statements,128.166.1,,"We have audited the accompanying combined financial statements of Siemens Audiologische Technik GmbH, Erlangen, and the other entities included (entirety of entities included in the combined financial statements), which comprise the combined statements of financial position, the combined statements of income, the combined statements of comprehensive income, the combined statements of cash flow and the combined statements of changes in equity and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, for the fiscal years from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 and October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. _Management’s Responsibility for the Combined Financial Statements_ The Management of Siemens Audiologische Technik GmbH is responsible for the preparation of these combined financial statements. This responsibility includes preparing these combined financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU to give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the group in accordance with these requirements. The company’s management is also responsible for the internal controls that management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of combined financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. _Auditor’s Responsibility_ Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW) as well as in supplementary compliance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Accordingly, we are required to comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. The selection of audit procedures depends on the auditor’s professional judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In assessing those risks, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the preparation of the combined financial statements that give a true and fair view. The aim of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the given circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. _Audit Opinion_ Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we state that our audit of the combined financial statements has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the combined financial statements comply in all material respects with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and give a true and fair view of the net assets and financial position of the company and entities included in the combined financial statements as at September 30, 2014, September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012, as well as the results of operations for the fiscal years then ended, in accordance with these requirements.
