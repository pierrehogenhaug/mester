Interest on the secured notes will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on          and        of each year, beginning on     , 2023. The secured notes will mature on       , 2028.

If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers (as defined below), then upon the closing of this offering, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of notes in this offering, together with certain additional amounts, into a separate escrow account for each series of notes. If the Mergers are not consummated on or before September 30, 2023, or the Merger Agreement (as defined below) is terminated prior to such date, the Issuer will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes of each series at a redemption price equal to 100% of the original offering price of each series of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such mandatory redemption of such series. Until the release of the proceeds in an escrow account, the applicable series of notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in such escrow account and funds held therein. If this offering is consummated at or following the time of the consummation of the Mergers, we will forego the escrow procedures described in this offering circular. See “Description of Secured Notes—Escrow Related Provisions” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow Related Provisions.” This offering is not conditioned upon the completion of the Mergers. The Mergers are, however, subject to certain closing conditions, including required shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions, and neither the Company nor the Issuer can guarantee that the Mergers will be completed on a timely basis or at all. For further details regarding the Mergers and the other Transactions (as defined below), see “The Transactions.” If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers, at the time of issuance, each series of notes will initially be the senior secured obligations of the Issuer, secured only by the amounts deposited in the applicable escrow account (as described above). If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers, each series of notes will initially be guaranteed by the Company and will not be guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries, IAA Holding (as defined below) or any of IAA Holding’s subsidiaries. Upon consummation of the Mergers, each series of notes will be, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, in the case of the unsecured notes, and on a senior secured basis, in the case of the secured notes, by the Company and each of the Company’s other subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) or certain capital markets indebtedness, including the other series of notes offered hereby. IAA Holding and its subsidiaries that will become a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement are expected to become guarantors of the notes following the consummation of the Mergers. The secured notes and related guarantees thereto will be secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by first priority liens on substantially the same collateral that secures the obligations under the Credit Agreement as described herein. The unsecured notes and related guarantees thereto will not be secured by any collateral. Each series of notes and the related guarantees respectively will be equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior ----- future subordinated debt, if any, in each case, without giving effect to collateral arrangements. The secured notes and related guarantees, respectively, will be pari passu with the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations that are secured by a first priority lien (subject to certain permitted liens) on the Collateral (as defined under “Description of Secured Notes”) (including the borrowings under the Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior liens, including the unsecured notes and the Company’s 2016 Notes (as defined herein), in each case to the extent of the value of the Collateral. The unsecured notes and the related guarantees, respectively, will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations that are secured, including the secured notes and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations, in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Each series of notes and the related guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that do not guarantee the notes. See “Description of Secured Notes” and “Description of Unsecured Notes.” The initial purchasers are offering the notes to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In addition, the initial purchasers, through their respective selling agents, are offering the notes to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.

In addition, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of each series of notes at any time and from time to time before     , 2026, with an amount up to the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % and     % (with respect to the secured notes and unsecured notes, respectively) of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem all or a portion of each series of notes at any time and from time to time before          , 2025 and      , 2026 (with respect to the secured notes and unsecured notes, respectively) at a redemption price of 100% of the original offering price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. If we experience certain kinds of changes of control following the consummation of the Mergers, the Issuer may be required to repurchase each series of notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of each series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. If we make certain asset sales and do not use the net proceeds for specified purposes, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase each series of notes with such net proceeds at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. Each series of notes will be evidenced by one or more global notes deposited with a custodian for and registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company. Except as described herein, beneficial interests in a global note will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by The Depository Trust Company and its direct and indirect participants in respect of each series of notes. No public market currently exists for the notes. Neither we nor the Issuer intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of any series of notes in any automated quotation system. _See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30 to read about important factors you should consider before buying the notes. Before investing in the notes, you should also consider the risks described under “Risk Factors” in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been incorporated by reference in this offering circular (as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our public filings). _",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to presenting financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP in this offering circular, we also have included certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA of Ritchie Bros. (“RBA Adjusted EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA of IAA (“IAA Adjusted EBITDA”) and adjusted pro forma EBITDA, adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders, operating free cash flow (“OFCF”), pro forma gross leverage, pro forma net leverage, pro forma secured net leverage and ratios utilizing one or more of such measures, which we believe are useful to help investors better understand our financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we updated the calculation of RBA Adjusted EBITDA to add back share-based payments expense, all acquisition-related costs (including any share based continuing employment costs recognized in acquisition-related costs), and gain or loss on disposition of property, plant and equipment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we updated our calculation of return on invested capital, which is now calculated as reported return divided by average invested capital. Reported return is defined as net income attributable to stockholders excluding the impact of net interest expense, tax effected at the Company’s adjusted annualized effective tax rate. We also updated the calculation of average invested capital to include average short term debt. Similarly, adjusted return on invested capital is calculated as adjusted return divided by adjusted average invested capital. Adjusted return is defined as reported return, updated as noted above, and adjusted for items that we do not consider to be part of our normal operating results, tax effected at the applicable tax rate. Adjusted average invested capital is calculated as average invested capital, updated as noted above, but excludes any long-term debt in escrow. Each of these changes have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented, as applicable. RBA Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses, interest expense, income tax expense, and subtracting interest income from net income, as well as adding back share-based payments expense, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss on disposition of property, plant and equipment and excluding the effects of any non-recurring or unusual adjusting items. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders are each calculated on a pro forma basis as described in Note 7 of the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” IAA Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization and further adjusted for items that IAA’s management believes are not representative of ongoing operations including, but not limited to, (a) non-income, tax-related accruals, (b) fair value adjustments related to contingent considerations, (c) severance, restructuring and other retention expenses, (d) for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021, incremental costs and expenses associated with COVID-19, including cleaning services, cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment, (e) the net loss or gain on the sale of assets or expenses associated with certain M&A, financing and other transactions, (f) acquisition costs and (g) certain professional fees, as well as (h) gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusted net income for IAA is calculated as net income further adjusted for items that IAA’s management believes are not representative of ongoing operations including, but not limited to, (a) non-income, tax-related accruals, (b) fair value adjustments related to contingent considerations, (c) severance, restructuring and other retention expenses, (d) for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021, incremental costs and expenses associated with COVID-19, including cleaning services, cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment, (e) the net loss or gain on the sale of assets or expenses associated with certain M&A, financing and other transactions, (f) acquisition costs, and (g) certain professional fees, as well as (h) gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange rates, (i) the amortization of acquired intangible assets and (j) loss on extinguishment of debt, and further adjusted to reflect the tax impact of these items. We believe RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) they are among the measures used by the respective management team to evaluate operating performance; (ii) they are among the measures used by the respective management team to make day-to-day operating decisions and (iii) they are frequently used by investors and other interested parties. RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures iv ----- either in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our or IAA’s working capital needs; - RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect our or IAA’s interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; - RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect our or IAA’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our or IAA’s taxes; - RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we or IAA consider not to be indicative of future operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized with the exception of certain intangible assets will often have to be replaced in the future and RBA Adjusted EBITDA, IAA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - we may use terms similar to “Adjusted EBITDA” in certain debt agreements, including those governing the Credit Agreement and the notes, where the definitions of such terms used in such agreements may not be the same as the definitions used in this offering circular; and - other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We provide a reconciliation of RBA Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders to our net income, pro forma net income and pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders, respectively, which, in each case, is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. See the notes to the tables under the heading “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Ritchie Bros.” and Note 7 to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” We also use the non-GAAP financial measures: pro forma gross leverage, pro forma net leverage, pro forma secured net leverage and ratios utilizing one or more of such measures. Refer to the footnotes under “Summary—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Other Data” for a description of the calculation and usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that comparing OFCF on a trailing twelve-month basis to different financial periods provides an effective measure of the cash generated by our business and provides useful information regarding cash flows remaining for discretionary return to stockholders, mergers and acquisitions, or debt reduction. We calculate OFCF by subtracting net capital spending from cash provided by operating activities. We calculate net capital spending as property, plant and equipment additions plus intangible asset additions less proceeds on disposition of property, plant and equipment. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net income, operating cash flows and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth v ----- of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this offering circular under “Summary—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Other Data” and “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Ritchie Bros.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Ritchie Bros.,9.1.1,Company Overview,"Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated is a world leader in asset management technologies and disposition of commercial assets, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of IAA, generated $3.8 billion in total revenue, earned $283 million in net income, and earned $1.0 billion of adjusted pro forma EBITDA. See “—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Other Data” for an explanation of our definition of adjusted pro forma EBITDA. We believe our expertise, global reach, market insights and trusted portfolio of brands provide us with a unique position within the used equipment market. Through our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, listings and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of primarily used commercial and industrial assets as well as government surplus. Construction and commercial transportation assets comprise the majority of the equipment sold by GTV, though we sell a wide variety of assets. Customers selling equipment through our sales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including construction, commercial transportation, agriculture, energy and natural resources. We also provide our customers with a wide array of value-added services aligned with our growth strategy to create a global marketplace for used equipment services and solutions. Our other services include access to equipment financing, asset appraisals and inspections, online equipment listings, logistical services and ancillary services such as equipment refurbishment. We offer our customers asset technology solutions to manage the end-to-end disposition process of their assets and provide market data intelligence to make more accurate and reliable business decisions. Additionally, we offer our customers an innovative technology platform that supports equipment lifecycle 1 ----- management and parts procurement integration with both original equipment manufacturers and dealers, as well as a software-as-a-service platform for end-to-end parts procurement, and access to digital catalogs and diagrams.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Service** **Brand Solutions** **Description of Offering,9.3.2,Service Revenue Overview,"Commissions from sales at our auctions represent the percentage earned by us on the gross proceeds from equipment and other assets sold at auction. The majority of our commissions are earned as a pre-negotiated fixed rate of the gross selling price. Other commissions from sales at our auctions are earned from underwritten commission contracts, when we guarantee a certain level of proceeds to a consignor. We accept equipment and other assets on consignment and stimulate buyer interest through professional marketing techniques by matching sellers (also known as consignors) to buyers through the auction or private sale process. Prior to offering certain items for sale on our online marketplaces, we also perform inspections to evidence for our buyers that one of our inspectors has personally visited the item, taken pictures and conducted an inspection of key systems and components. Following the sale of the item, we invoice the buyer for the purchase price of the asset, taxes and, if applicable, the buyer transaction fee, collect payment from the buyer and remit the proceeds to the seller, net of the seller commissions, applicable taxes and applicable fees. Commissions are calculated as a percentage of the winning bid price of the property sold at auction. Fees are also charged to sellers for listing and inspecting equipment. Other revenue earned in the process of conducting our auctions include administrative, documentation and advertising fees. With the final acceptance of the winning bid, the highest bidder becomes legally obligated to pay the full purchase price, which is the winning bid price of the property purchased and the seller is legally obligated to relinquish the property in exchange for the winning bid price less any seller’s commissions. Commission and fee revenue are recognized on the date of the auction sale upon the final acceptance of the winning bid. Under the standard terms and conditions of our auction sales, we are not obligated to pay a consignor for property that has not been paid for by the buyer, provided the property has not been released to the buyer. If the buyer defaults on its payment obligation, also referred to as a collapsed sale, the sale is cancelled in the period in which the determination is made, and the property is returned to the consignor or placed in a later event-based or online auction. Historically, service revenues on cancelled sales have not been material. Online marketplace commission revenue is reduced by a provision for disputes, which is an estimate of disputed items that are expected to be settled at a cost to us, related to settlements of discrepancies under our equipment condition certification program. The equipment condition certification refers to a written inspection report provided to potential buyers that reflects the condition of a specific piece of equipment offered for sale, and includes ratings, comments and photographs of the equipment following inspection by one of our equipment inspectors. The equipment condition certification provides that a buyer may file a written dispute claim during an eligible dispute period for consideration and resolution at our sole determination if the purchased equipment is not substantially in the condition represented in the inspection report. Typically disputes under the equipment condition certification program are settled with minor repairs or additional services, such as washing or detailing the item; the estimated costs of such items or services are included in the provision for disputes. 3 ----- Commission revenue is recorded net of commissions owed to third parties, which are principally the result of situations when the commission is shared with a consignor in an auction guarantee risk and reward sharing arrangement. Underwritten commission contracts can also take the form of guarantee contracts. Guarantee contracts typically include a pre-negotiated percentage of the guaranteed gross proceeds plus a percentage of proceeds in excess of the guaranteed amount. If actual auction proceeds are less than the guaranteed amount, commission is reduced; if proceeds are sufficiently lower, we can incur a loss on the sale. Losses, if any, resulting from guarantee contracts are recorded in the period in which the relevant auction is completed. If a loss relating to a guarantee contract held at the period end to be sold after the period end is known or is probable and estimable at the financial statement reporting date, the loss is accrued in the financial statements for that period. Our exposure from these guarantee contracts fluctuates over time. Other services revenue also includes fees for refurbishment, logistical services, financing, appraisals, data and software subscriptions and other ancillary and transactional service fees. Fees are recognized in the period in which the service is provided or the product is delivered to the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Revenue related to inventory contracts is recognized in the period in which the sale is completed, title to the property passes to the purchaser and we have fulfilled any other obligations that may be relevant to the transaction. In our role as auctioneer, we auction our inventory to equipment buyers through the auction process. Following the sale of the item, we invoice the buyer for the purchase price of the asset, taxes and, if applicable, the buyer transaction fee, and collect payment from the buyer. With the final acceptance of the winning bid, the highest bidder becomes legally obligated to pay the full purchase price, which is the winning bid price of the property purchased. Title to the property is transferred in exchange for the winning bid price, and if applicable, the buyer transaction fee plus applicable taxes.

We believe our strategy will help us unlock significant growth opportunities by building on our core business and expanding into additional services. We are building on our position as a trusted advisor to our customers by evolving from transactional selling to meeting the needs of our customers through solution selling. We see significant growth opportunities ahead by becoming the trusted global marketplace for insights, services, and transaction solutions for commercial assets and vehicles. This represents not a shift, but an expansion of our transaction solutions for which we are already well known. We value our long-tenured relationships with our customers, and the trust they have in our brand and platform.

Building an integrated, easy to use marketplace, and becoming the trusted advisor to our customers opens significant potential for our business.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Competitive Strengths,9.5.1,,"Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet our obligations to customers, grow our business and create shareholder value because of the following factors: - **Industry Leader in Highly Fragmented Market – The global used equipment market is highly fragmented with total annual global used equipment transaction volumes estimated at more than $300 billion per year. We estimate the used equipment auction segment currently represents approximately $30 billion of GTV per year. Ritchie Bros. is among the largest auction companies with approximately $6.0 billion in GTV for the year ended December 31, 2022, $5.5 billion in GTV for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $5.4 billion in GTV for the year ended December 31, 2020. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. In addition to the auction segment, other major segments include brokers, as well as the retail segment, which includes OEMs, OEM dealers, rental companies and large strategic accounts. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had previously tried selling their equipment privately. Given the fragmentation in the auction market, as well as upstream opportunities in private sales and retail, we believe there is significant opportunity for growth. - **Global Platform** – We pride ourselves on our ability to connect buyers and sellers through our digital channels as well as a global network of over 40 auction sites in 13 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands. Our online bidding technology and Ritchie Bros. website are currently available in 10 and 22 languages, respectively. Our global presence allows us to generate deep pools of liquidity for transactions enabling global market pricing for our equipment sellers, helping to deliver strong and efficient price realization for assets. - **Customer Relationships – Relationships are the core of Ritchie Bros. – delighting customers and treating them like friends while meeting their business needs. By offering a broad choice of solutions that best suit our customers’ needs, making their lives easier in the process, we develop relationships that can last across generations. We take a long-term approach with our customers and as such we position our sales force to act as trusted advisors to our customers. - **Breadth of Solutions – Our platform provides us with the ability to meet our buyers’ and sellers’ unique needs in a one-stop-shop manner. By delivering choice through our disposition channels, we can work with customers as a trusted advisor to provide them each with a tailored suite of equipment disposition solutions and asset management capabilities to best meet their needs. In addition to transaction solutions, Ritchie Bros. offers a variety of value-added services to our customers including financial services, market data, valuation insights, inspections, appraisals, commercial transportations, refurbishment and digital parts procurement. - **Delivering Insights and Services Through Data & Analytics – A core part of our strategy is delivering insights and services through rich data and analytics. Based on the world’s largest used equipment transaction dataset, we provide data products that allow customers to analyze market dynamics and value assets. Additionally, Rouse Services is the leading provider of rental metrics benchmarks and equipment valuations to lenders, rental companies, contractors and dealers. Rouse’s business model is built upon an extensive data ecosystem, proprietary analytics and data science techniques and trusted customer relationships rooted in service and confidentiality. We continue to invest in data science to deliver asset value predictions, generate user leads, prioritize marketing investments, interpret price trends and more. Proprietary algorithmic asset pricing is used internally to set target values and optimize marketplace operations and externally to provide users of Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions with instant asset values on inventory. The monthly Ritchie Bros. Used Equipment Market Trends Summary report features our proprietary use of Machine Learning to provide MixAdjusted Price Indexes for core asset groups around the globe. Correlated with other leading economic indicators, these price indexes have been quickly adopted by customers, analysts, and manufacturers as a key insight into pricing trends. Machine Learning also supports important strategic and operational decisions such as site expansion, testing marketplace performance, and experimentation with improved formats. - **Track Record of Revenue Growth** – We have a demonstrated ability to grow our business through economic cycles as evidenced by our revenue compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of between 6 ----- approximately 10% and 11% over the last 20 years. During times of economic distress, equipment owners are forced to dispose of assets to generate incremental liquidity. This increased supply is met by increased demand from buyers who are searching for cost-effective solutions to their equipment needs and typically lower inventory stocks of new equipment as OEMs reduce production volumes. During strong economic conditions we benefit from our customers upgrading or changing the composition of their equipment fleets, supported by a strong equipment pricing environment. Ritchie Brothers Total Revenue (2000 – 2022) - **Strong Free Cash Flow** **Characteristics – We have historically generated significant OFCF, which we define as cash provided by operating activities less net capital spending. Over the last three fiscal years, we have generated approximately $1,063.8 million of OFCF (without giving effect to the Mergers). Furthermore, we have relatively low capital spending requirements. For a reconciliation of OFCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, please see “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Ritchie Bros.” - **Highly Experienced Management Team – Our executive management team has extensive operational experience and deep industry knowledge, as well as significant prior experience executing and successfully integrating strategic acquisitions. Likewise, the management team of IAA, which will continue to manage and operate their business following the Mergers, has many decades of industry and operating expertise.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,The Transactions,9.6.1,Company Overview,"IAA is a leading global digital marketplace connecting vehicle buyers and sellers. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, IAA’s platform facilitates the marketing and sale of total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles and vehicle parts for a full spectrum of sellers. IAA’s primary business comprises the auctioning of consigned vehicles. IAA also offers a comprehensive suite of auction, logistics and vehicle-processing services as part of its ability to increasingly function as a “one-stop shop” for vehicle sellers and buyers within IAA’s global digital marketplace. IAA’s integrated products and services aim to maximize the value of vehicles while lowering administrative costs and creating a frictionless customer experience throughout vehicle assignment, transport, inventory management, merchandising and sale. IAA markets vehicles to prospective buyers through its many marketplaces, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Auctions are typically held weekly for most locations and allow bidders to participate virtually at the auction. Certain vehicles are also offered for sale online via IAA Timed Auctions, where bidders may bid on those vehicles for a fixed duration of time, and via IAA Buy Now, where vehicles are offered for sale at a fixed price. All vehicles which are ready for sale are listed and available online on IAA Auction Center, allowing prospective bidders to preview and bid on vehicles prior to the digital auction event. IAA Auction Center includes a “Fast Search” function that allows for filtering to quickly locate specific vehicles and offers logged-in buyers additional services such as “Enhanced Vehicle Details” that includes VIN details and Hollander Interchange parts data to help buyers make informed purchasing decisions. IAA Auction Center provides online buyers with an open, competitive digital bidding environment. IAA’s mobile and online capabilities provide buyers the greatest flexibility in their purchasing options, exposing vehicles to bidders from around the globe and allowing bidders to participate in a greater number of auctions. Online inventory browsing, digital alerts (via email or through buyer app) and multiple vehicle payment methods reduce the time required to acquire vehicles, and the broader market exposure and increased competitive bidding generally drive higher selling prices. IAA believes the capabilities of its auction models maximize auction proceeds and returns for vehicle sellers. IAA has developed proprietary web-based information systems, such as Automated Salvage Auction Processing system for the United States segment and VISion for the International segment, to streamline all aspects of operations and centralize operational data collection. These systems provide sellers with 24-hour online access to powerful tools to manage the salvage disposition process, including inventory management, sales price analysis and electronic data interchange of titling information. IAA’s digital marketplace, combined with IAA’s merchandising platform (IAA Interact), provides buyers detailed information and optionality in how they bid and buy, which are key differentiators of IAA’s service offering, and helps sellers achieve the highest selling price on a given vehicle. IAA processed approximately 2.3 million total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles in fiscal 2022. In addition, IAA also offers products and services to: - expedite the process of vehicle pick-up, towing and assignment; - transport vehicles inbound to or outbound from its facilities; 8 ----- - optimize the organization and management of inventory; - merchandize vehicles to engage buyers with detailed vehicle information; and - facilitate the digital sale of vehicles to a global audience. _Selected Products and Services_ Catastrophe (“CAT”) Services** [Strategic catastrophe response service focused on real estate capacity, operational ] execution, transportation logistics and vehicle merchandising and selling.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,The Transactions,9.6.2,Revenue Model,"_Service Revenues_ Service revenues include auction and auction related fees for all vehicles sold by IAA. IAA does not take title to vehicles that are consigned to it by the seller and records auction fees on those vehicles on a net basis because IAA has no influence on the vehicle auction selling price agreed to by the seller and the buyer at the auction. The buyer fees are typically based on a tiered structure with fees increasing with the sale price of the vehicle, while the seller fees are typically fixed. IAA generally enforces its rights to payment for seller transactions through net settlement provisions following the sale of a vehicle. Greater than 90% of IAA’s revenue is generated at the time of auction as a result of the satisfaction of the seller and buyer performance obligations as described below. IAA’s contracts with sellers are short-term in nature. The performance obligation contained within IAA’s auction contracts for sellers is to facilitate the remarketing of salvage vehicles, including the inbound tow, processing, storage, titling, enhancing and sale at auction. These services are related to facilitating the sale of vehicles and are not distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly, revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when the vehicle is sold through the auction process. Related costs are deferred and recognized at the time of sale. IAA’s contracts with buyers are short-term in nature and are generally established via purchase at auction, subject to standard terms and conditions. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, which is satisfied at a point 9 ----- in time when the vehicle is purchased through the auction process. Buyers also pay a fixed registration fee to access the auctions for a one-year term in addition to the fees paid upon purchase of a vehicle. The performance obligation to provide access to the auctions, associated with the registration, is satisfied ratably over the one-year contractual term of the buyer agreement. Accordingly, registration fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year contract term. IAA also offers other services to buyers such as transportation, storage, vehicle condition reporting and other ancillary services. Revenue from such services is recognized in the period in which such services are provided. _Vehicle Sales_ Vehicle sales represent the selling price of the vehicles that are purchased by IAA and then resold. Buyer fees associated with vehicle sales are recorded in Service revenue. IAA’s performance obligation for these purchased vehicles is the completion of the online auction process and is satisfied at the point in time when the vehicle is sold through the auction process. As IAA acts as a principal, the vehicle sales price is recorded as revenue on a gross basis when the vehicle is sold.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,The Transactions,9.6.3,IAA’s Competitive Strengths,"- **Relationships & Market Share –** On the seller side of IAA’s marketplace, IAA maintains strong relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies in the markets it serves and is increasing penetration of non-insurance sellers. In the year ended January 1, 2023, for example, IAA secured a new exclusive top 15 national insurance company, won several markets from another national top ten insurance company, and signed a multi-year renewal of another top ten IAA customer. IAA’s marketplace serves as an alternative venue for damaged and lower-value vehicles and, as a result, non-insurance sellers have contributed to growth. IAA has also established relationships with the buy-side of its marketplace, which includes automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers and, where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers, among others. - **Robust Technology & Service Offerings, Strengthening Customer Engagement and IAA Operations** _– IAA’s products deliver enhanced economic benefits to customers by increasing transparency and reducing cycle time and friction. IAA continues to broaden its product portfolio by investing in the development of innovative solutions. Total Loss Solutions provides insurance companies with end-to-end outsourced solutions for the portion of the claims process prior to total loss determination and assignment to a salvage vehicle auction, which allows the insurance companies to reduce cycle time and cost, while improving employee engagement and customer service and ultimately increasing policyholder retention. IAA Loan Payoff mitigates the time-consuming process of managing a total loss claim requiring loan payoff and title release. IAA’s integration with Fastlane’s LossExpress solution expands lender coverage for total loss claims through IAA’s Loan Payoff portal. IAA’s integration with Dealertrack’s Dealertrack Accelerated Title solution expedites the total loss settlement and lien payoff process digitally and expands access to vehicle titles for all parties. Additionally, IAA is focused on reducing costs and driving efficiencies while maintaining its level of customer service. As a part of its buyer digital transformation initiative, IAA has shifted to a fully online, digital auction model which is generating cost savings by eliminating live physical auctions. IAA’s ongoing initiatives in other areas such as towing, pricing and branch process improvement will further enable it to execute on its strategy. - **Significant and Expanding Real Estate Footprint and Available Capacity** _- Since its spin-off from KAR Auction Services, Inc. (“KAR”), IAA has added over 1,100 useable acres to its footprint and increased geographic coverage to approximately 210 locations. In addition, IAA has also worked to optimize the layout of locations, resulting in 45% excess capacity, leaving ample room for growth. IAA has long-standing expertise spanning over 40 years in developing real estate for the business, including securing appropriate zoning and other regulatory requirements. For the year ended January 1, 2023, approximately 19% of IAA’s revenues were generated outside of the United States, and IAA is in the process of establishing or continuing to build operations in key geographic markets. IAA intends to strategically enter new markets by pursuing strategic acquisitions, partnerships or greenfield opportunities in high priority markets globally. - **Effective and Flexible Catastrophic Event Servicing – Since its spin-off from KAR, IAA has significantly increased its capabilities to service customers during catastrophic events, including the formation of a dedicated CAT Response Team and securing access to approximately 3,500 overflow acres in CAT event 10 ----- prone regions. In two recent CAT events, Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Ian, IAA serviced three of the top five insurers and received positive customer feedback. IAA’s operational performance metrics across both Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Ida were strong as measured by release-to-pick-up and ready-for-sale cycle times. The timing of offering CAT event vehicles in IAA’s auction is driven by DMV processing times, which can vary by state, and the sales strategy of each individual insurer.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,The Transactions,9.6.4,Strategic Rationale,"We believe that the Mergers could strengthen and accelerate our financial profile, capabilities, footprint and customer base in the following ways: - **IAA Has a Complementary Business Model and Capabilities –** The salvage vehicle resale process, either through auction or purchase and sale, closely resembles Ritchie Bros.’ used equipment resale process. IAA’s sophisticated technology assets and service capabilities—across areas such as titling and inspection—allow IAA to process a significant transaction volume. We believe these core functionalities can be applied to Ritchie Bros. to further streamline its operations. Similarly, Ritchie Bros. marketplace strategy can facilitate incremental services to enable a stronger customer value proposition. Together, we believe the combined business will have greater scale, customer proximity and capabilities. - **Enhances Scale and Services Mix, While Diversifying GTV Mix – For the year ended December 31, 2022, Ritchie Bros. generated approximately $6.0 billion of GTV. For the year ended January 1, 2023, IAA generated approximately $8.3 billion of GTV. On a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2023, the combined company generated approximately $14.3 billion of GTV, which would represent a 138% increase to Ritchie Bros.’ GTV on a standalone basis for the same period. The combined business is expected to derive 92% of its GTV from services and 8% from inventory, reducing the capital intensity and risk associated with the sales process. Further, IAA provides Ritchie Bros. with exposure to vehicles, further diversifying Ritchie Bros.’ GTV mix away from construction. (1) Represents the combined company GTV end market diversification for the years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2023 for Ritchie Bros. and IAA, respectively. - **IAA Has an Established Market Position, With Long-Standing Customer Relationships – IAA benefits from a number of competitive advantages, including its robust yard footprint, technology and settlement systems that manage several hundred thousand bids per week and established customer relationships. IAA has established relationships with major insurance carriers to ensure a consistent supply of vehicles to its platform. On the buyer side of its marketplace, IAA maintains relationships with a wide array of participants in the salvage vehicle ecosystem including recyclers, dealers, dismantlers, exporters and rebuilders. - **Salvage Vehicle Market Driven by Robust Secular Tailwinds That Are Expected to Fuel Through-The-",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,The Transactions,9.6.5,,"On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Original Merger Agreement”) with the Issuer, Impala Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer (“Merger Sub 1”), Impala Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer (“Merger Sub 2”), and IAA, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire IAA for approximately 70,334,262 of our common shares (as defined below) and estimated cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into IAA (the “First Merger”), with IAA surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer (the “Surviving Corporation”) and (ii) immediately following the consummation of the First Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into Merger Sub 2 (together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub 2 surviving as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer (“IAA Holding”). On January 22, 2023, the Company, IAA and the other parties to the Merger Agreement entered into the Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Amendment” and the Original Merger Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, and as it may be further amended or modified, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to 7 ----- which the parties agreed to amend the merger consideration among other things, as further described under “—The Mergers.” **IAA** The information below about IAA has been derived from the periodic reports that IAA has filed with the SEC. Founded in 1982, IAA is headquartered in Westchester, Illinois, with approximately 210 facilities throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom (the “UK”). IAA serves a global buyer base and a full spectrum of sellers, including insurance companies, dealerships, fleet lease and rental car companies and charitable organizations. IAA’s principal executive offices are located at Two Westbrook Corporate Center, 10th Floor Suite 500, Westchester, IL 60154 and its telephone number is (708) 492-7000. IAA Common Stock (as defined below) trades on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “IAA.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Cycle Performance – The salvage vehicle marketplace has historically benefited from a growing number of,9.7.1,,"11 ----- vehicles on the road (“Car Parc”) and an increasing average age of vehicles. Growth in the number of vehicles in operation contributes to a rising number of automotive accidents, which we expect will support increased volumes through the combined company’s marketplaces. Meanwhile, vehicle owners have continued to drive the same vehicle for longer periods of time. As vehicles become older and their residual values decline, we expect it will become more likely that these vehicles will surpass the total loss threshold when involved in an accident and be sold on behalf of insurers through the combined company’s marketplaces. Furthermore, vehicle design has become increasingly more complex in recent years, as automotive manufacturers seek to differentiate themselves from competitors by incorporating new complex technologies and other enhancements into their designs in order to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. These technological advancements have resulted in higher repair and part replacement costs following an accident, making insurance companies more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss. - **Combined Yard Footprint Expected to Accelerate the Combined Company’s Growth Strategies – Access to IAA’s approximately 210 total yards provides an opportunity to accelerate Ritchie Bros.’ existing local yard strategy to drive incremental GTV growth and defer associated startup costs. Approximately 75% of IAA yards have more than 5 acres of capacity as of January 1, 2023, the minimum amount required for a Ritchie Bros. local yard. Having more total yards may also increase customer proximity to those yards, which we believe can meaningfully accelerate GTV growth. Additionally, access to Ritchie Bros.’ “auction” yards in strategic locations, such as Florida and Texas, are expected to allow the combined company to bolster its catastrophic event capacity, which we believe will strengthen its customer value proposition. Also, Ritchie Bros.’ international presence in countries such as Germany, Australia, France, Italy and Spain will further potentially drive the combined company’s growth in new markets. - **Potential Significant Cost Synergy and Incremental Revenue Opportunities Expected to Facilitate",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Margin Improvement and Deleveraging – The Mergers present a potential cost synergy opportunity of,9.8.1,The Mergers,"Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of IAA common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “IAA Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”) (excluding any shares of IAA Common Stock held by IAA as treasury stock, owned by the Company, the Issuer, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the Effective Time, or owned by stockholders of IAA who have validly demanded and not withdrawn appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted automatically into the right to receive: (i) 0.5252 of a common share, without par value, of the Company (our “common shares”) and (ii) $12.80 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (together, the “Merger Consideration”). In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, all outstanding IAA equity awards (other than those that vest in accordance with their terms upon the First Merger) will be assumed by the Company. Based upon the estimated number of outstanding Ritchie Bros. common shares, outstanding shares of IAA Common Stock and outstanding equity awards and other convertible securities of the parties, in each case as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Mergers, Ritchie Bros. and IAA estimate that, upon completion of the Mergers, the existing Ritchie Bros. shareholders are expected to own approximately 62.8% of the outstanding common shares (of which approximately 3.7% will be owned by the Starboard purchasers on a fully diluted basis) and former IAA stockholders are expected to own approximately 37.2% of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis. Each party has agreed to call a meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote on (i) in the case of the Company, a proposal to approve the issuance of our common shares to IAA securityholders in connection with the Mergers (the “Ritchie Bros. Share Issuance Proposal”), and (ii) in the case of IAA, among other things, a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “IAA Merger 12 ----- Proposal”). The closing of the Mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, among other things, (a) the approval of the Ritchie Bros. Share Issuance Proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our outstanding common shares (the “Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval”), (b) the approval of the IAA Merger Proposal by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IAA common stock entitled to vote thereon (the “IAA Stockholder Approval”), (c) the approval for listing by the NYSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) of our common shares to be issued in the First Merger, (d) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each of us and IAA contained in the Merger Agreement and the compliance by each party with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, (e) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each of the Company (with respect to IAA’s obligations) and IAA (with respect to our obligations) and (f) other customary closing conditions. Ritchie Bros. currently expects the Mergers to close in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions. There is no guarantee that the Mergers will close within the anticipated timeframe or at all. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of the Company, the Issuer, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and IAA, including, among others, covenants by each of the Company and IAA to use its reasonable efforts to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects between the date of signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Mergers and prohibiting the parties from engaging in certain kinds of activities during such period without the consent of the other party. Each of the Company and IAA has agreed to customary non-solicitation covenants that prohibit them from soliciting competing proposals or entering into discussions or negotiations or providing confidential information in connection with certain proposals for an alternative transaction. These non-solicitation provisions allow the Company and IAA, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations under the Merger Agreement, to provide nonpublic information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties in response to an unsolicited competing proposal. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the boards of directors of the Company and IAA may change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Mergers in response to an unsolicited competing proposal that such board determines is more favorable to the Company shareholders or IAA stockholders, respectively, than the Mergers, or another intervening event as specified in the Merger Agreement, if such board of directors determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Merger Agreement contains customary termination rights for the Company and IAA, including if (i) the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval or the IAA Stockholder Approval is not obtained, (ii) the Mergers are not consummated by August 7, 2023, as such date may be extended under the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”), or (iii) any law, order, decree, ruling or judgment permanently prohibits completion of the Mergers. The Merger Agreement also provides certain termination rights for the benefit of each party, including (A) if the other party’s board of directors changes its recommendation to stockholders in relation to the Mergers, (B) for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the other party under the Merger Agreement (subject to certain procedures and materiality exceptions) and (C) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company or IAA, as applicable, would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $189 million. In addition, the Amendment provides that, in the event that either the Company or IAA elects to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the Company’s failure to obtain the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval, the Company would be required to reimburse IAA for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by IAA in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Mergers up to a maximum amount of $5.0 million. The Merger Agreement provides that, as of immediately following the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company will consist of twelve members, of whom (i) eight directors will be designated by the Company, which designees will consist of: Erik Olsson, who will continue as Chair of the board of directors; Ann Fandozzi, who will continue as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and six existing directors of the Company who are independent under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and applicable Canadian securities laws as designated by the Company; and (ii) four directors of IAA, three of whom are independent under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and applicable Canadian securities laws, as designated by IAA.

(“BANA”), BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA”), Royal Bank of Canada (“Royal Bank”) and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”), pursuant to which the initial lenders committed to provide (i) a backstop senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750 million (the “Backstop Revolving Facility”), which revolving commitments were subsequently terminated in connection with the Sixth Amendment (as defined below) and (ii) a senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.8 billion (the “Bridge Loan Facility”), which commitments were subsequently reduced to $886.1 million in connection with the Sixth Amendment (and the proceeds of this offering will extinguish the remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility), to finance up to $2.8 billion of the (i) cash consideration in connection with the Mergers, (ii) repayment of certain existing indebtedness of IAA and refinancing of our existing term loan (which occurred in connection with the Sixth Amendment) and (iii) fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The proceeds of this offering will extinguish the remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility. On December 9, 2022, we entered into a sixth amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to our existing credit agreement dated October 27, 2016 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented and otherwise modified prior to December 9, 2022, the “Existing Credit Agreement”; the Existing Credit Agreement as amended by the Sixth Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”) with BANA, as the administrative agent, the existing lenders and the new term loan A lenders (the “new TLA lenders”) pursuant to which, among other things, we obtained (i) the consents from the existing lenders required to consummate the Mergers, (ii) commitments for a term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.825 billion (the “New Term Loan A Facility”) to be used to finance the Mergers and (iii) the ability to borrow up to $200 million of the revolving facility on a limited conditionality basis to finance the Mergers (collectively with the Bridge Loan Facility and any replacement thereof, the “Debt Financing”). The procurement of the consents and the New Term Loan A Facility under the Sixth Amendment allowed us to (i) terminate the commitments for the Backstop Revolving Facility; and (ii) reduce the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility by an amount equal to the amount of the New Term Loan A Facility and the amount of existing term loans under our Existing Credit Agreement.

Upon consummation of the Mergers, the applicable margin for the revolving facility and the Term Loan A Facility will increase by 0.25% if we do not receive at least $800 million of net cash proceeds from this offering of unsecured notes. The new TLA lenders’ obligation to fund the New Term Loan A Facility (and our ability to draw up to $200 million on the revolver) on the Mergers Closing Date is subject to limited conditions as set forth in the Sixth Amendment and consistent with those in the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, including, among others, 14 ----- completion of the Mergers, the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as defined in the Sixth Amendment) on IAA, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to Ritchie Bros. and IAA, the delivery of certain financial statements of Ritchie Bros. and IAA and other customary limited conditions to completion. The commitments of the new TLA lenders will terminate on the commitment termination date. The Merger Agreement provides that we are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letter executed in connection therewith. Additionally, we will not, without the prior written consent of IAA (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), take any action or enter into any transaction that would or would be reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the funding of all or any portion of the cash amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund all cash amounts required to be paid by us on the Mergers Closing Date, including the Merger Consideration, any cash fees under the Debt Commitment Letter and all related expenses owed, each due and payable at closing, and upon reasonable written request IAA, we will keep IAA informed, in all reasonable detail on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status of our efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing. We are obligated to reimburse IAA for certain reasonable out-of-pocket fees, and indemnify IAA for all losses it incurs, in connection with its cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing, whether or not the transactions are consummated or the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms therein.

The secured notes: $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % senior secured notes due 2028. The unsecured notes: $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % senior notes due 2031. Maturity Dates ........................ The secured notes:      , 2028. The unsecured notes:      , 2031. Interest .................................... The secured notes: Interest on the secured notes will accrue at a rate of     % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on       and       of each year, commencing      , 2023. The unsecured notes: Interest on the unsecured notes will accrue at a rate of     % per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on       and       of each year, commencing      , 2023. Guarantees .............................. If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers, each series of notes will initially be guaranteed by the Company, but not by any of the Company’s other subsidiaries and will not be guaranteed by IAA Holding or any of its respective subsidiaries. Upon consummation of the Mergers, each series of notes will be, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, in the case of the unsecured notes, and on a senior secured basis, in the case of the secured notes, by the Company and each of the Company’s other subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Credit Agreement or certain capital markets indebtedness, including the other series of notes offered hereby. IAA Holding and its subsidiaries that become a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement are expected to become guarantors following the consummation of the Mergers. See “Description of Secured Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Guarantees.” While we expect each of these entities to become guarantors of the notes upon or shortly after the consummation of the Mergers, if any such entity is (a) a CFC, (b) a U.S. subsidiary all or substantially all of the assets of which consist of the equity interests of one or more CFCs or (c) a U.S. subsidiary that is a subsidiary of a CFC then, subject to certain exceptions, that entity will not provide a guarantee. For this purpose, a “CFC” means any controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is owned (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by the Issuer, or any affiliate of the Issuer that is a U.S. Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not expect such entities to constitute a material portion of the combined company’s assets, revenues or pro forma RBA Adjusted EBITDA. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing and future liabilities of certain of our subsidiaries which are not guaranteeing the notes.” 19 ----- We expect that, following consummation of the Mergers, IAA Holding and its subsidiaries that become a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement will also become a guarantor of each series of notes. As of December 31, 2022, on a historical basis (without giving effect to the Mergers), (a) our existing subsidiaries that will not be guarantors of the notes following the consummation of the Mergers had $72.7 million of liabilities (to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $256.2 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances and (b) IAA Holding’s existing subsidiaries that will not be guarantors of the notes following the consummation of the Mergers had $942.7 million of liabilities (to which the notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $1,721.9 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances. Collateral ................................ At the time of issuance, each series of notes will initially be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations, secured only by the amounts deposited in the applicable escrow account. Upon consummation of the Mergers, the secured notes and related guarantees, respectively, will be secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by first priority liens on substantially the same collateral that secures the obligations under the Credit Agreement as described herein. The unsecured notes and related guarantees thereto will not be secured by any collateral. Intercreditor Agreement........... In connection with the issuance of the secured notes, upon consummation of the Mergers, we will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Notes Collateral Agent (as defined below) and the administrative agent under Credit Agreement (the “Bank Collateral Agent”). The Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the rights of, and relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the secured notes, the Bank Collateral Agent, the lenders and other secured parties under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any other future pari passu first-priority lien debt (and their representative) in respect of the exercise of rights and remedies against the Issuer and the guarantors. Priority .................................... Upon consummation of the Mergers, each series of notes and the related guarantees, respectively, will be: - equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior debt (including borrowings under the Credit Agreement), without giving effect to collateral arrangements; - senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ future subordinated debt, if any, without giving effect to the collateral arrangements; and - structurally subordinated in right of payment to all liabilities (including trade payables) of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. In addition, the secured notes and related guarantees, respectively, will be pari passu with our and the guarantors’ obligations that are secured by a first priority lien (subject to certain permitted liens) on the Collateral (including the borrowings under the Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and effectively senior to our and the guarantors’ respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior liens, including the unsecured notes and our 2016 Notes, in each case to the extent of the value of the Collateral. The unsecured notes and related guarantees, respectively, will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s, the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ obligations that are secured, including the secured notes and the Credit Agreement, in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 20 ----- As of December 31, 2022, as adjusted for the Transactions, we would have had approximately $3,260.0 million of total debt (excluding debt issuance costs and capital lease obligations), including $2,460.0 million of secured indebtedness, consisting of the secured notes offered hereby and $1,910.0 million under the Credit Agreement, and $800.0 million of unsecured indebtedness consisting of the unsecured notes offered hereby, and we would have had $738.9 million of availability under the Credit Agreement after giving effect to the $11.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. Optional Redemption .............. On or after      , 2025 and      , 2026 (with respect to the secured notes and the unsecured notes, respectively), the Issuer may redeem either series of notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the redemption prices described in the section “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption—Optional Redemption” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem either series of notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time before     , 2025 and     , 2026 (with respect to the secured notes and the unsecured notes, respectively), at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of either series of notes at any time and from time to time before      , 2026, with an amount up to the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of % and      % (with respect to the secured notes and the unsecured notes, respectively) of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Change of Control .................. If we experience certain kinds of changes of control following the consummation of the Mergers, the Issuer may be required to repurchase each series of notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of each series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. For more details, see “Description of Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Change of Control.” Additional Amounts; Tax Redemption ......................... All payments in respect of the secured notes, the unsecured notes and the related guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes except to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by law in a relevant tax jurisdiction, subject to certain exceptions, an additional amount will be paid so that the net amount received by a holder or a beneficial holder is no less than the amount that such holder or beneficial holder would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction, provided that no additional amount will be paid for U.S. withholding taxes imposed, withheld or deducted on any payment on or with respect to the notes. See “Description of Secured Notes—Additional Amounts” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Additional Amounts.” If certain changes in tax law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) in a relevant tax jurisdiction become effective that would require an additional amount to be paid or certain tax indemnification payments be made with respect to a series of notes or the guarantees with respect thereto, we may redeem such series of notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, and all additional amounts, if any. See “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding 21 ----- Tax” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption—Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Tax.” Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption ........ This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers. The completion of this offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers. If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Mergers, upon the closing of this offering, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of notes in this offering, together with certain additional amounts, into a separate escrow account for each series of notes. If the Mergers are not consummated on or before September 30, 2023 or the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to such date, the Issuer will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes of each series at a redemption price equal to 100% of the original offering price of each series of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such mandatory redemption. In such event, the escrowed proceeds will be applied to fund a portion of such redemption price. If this offering is consummated at or following the time of the consummation of the Mergers, we will forego the escrow procedures described in this offering circular. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption.” Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following Certain Assets Sales ............. [If we make certain asset sales and do not use the net proceeds for specified purposes, ] the Issuer may in certain circumstances be required to offer to repurchase each series of notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. For more details, see “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.” Certain Covenants .................. The indentures governing the notes will contain covenants that will, after consummation of the Mergers, limit, among other things, the Company’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ (including the Issuer) ability to: - incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof); - incur or create liens on their assets securing indebtedness; - make certain restricted payments; - make certain investments; - dispose of certain assets; - allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company or the Issuer; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and - consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into other companies. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. See “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants.” If on any date after consummation of the Mergers, the notes have an investment grade rating from both of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s 22 ----- Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), subject to certain conditions, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including the Issuer) will no longer be subject to certain of these covenants until such date, if any, that the notes lose their investment grade rating from either or both of S&P or Moody’s, after which the suspended covenants will be reinstated. See “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants— Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade.” Form and Denomination .......... The notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes will be issued in book-entry form and will be represented by global certificates deposited with, or on behalf of DTC (as defined below), and registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee. Beneficial interests in the notes will be shown on, and transfers will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee; and these interests may not be exchanged for certificated notes, except in limited circumstances. Transfer Restrictions .............. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities law of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in accordance with other applicable securities law. Neither we nor the Issuer intend to list any series of notes on any securities exchange. No Registration Rights ........... Neither we nor the Issuer are required to exchange any series of notes for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act. Use of Proceeds ...................... We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with proceeds from the Term Loan A Facility and cash from our balance sheet, to fund the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, refinance IAA’s existing indebtedness, repay or refinance all of our indebtedness, including our existing 2016 Notes, pay the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend and pay related fees and expenses. Nothing in this offering circular shall constitute a notice of redemption for our existing 2016 Notes. This offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers. However, upon the closing of this offering, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of notes in this offering, together with certain additional amounts, into a separate escrow account for each series of notes. If the Mergers are not consummated on or before September 30, 2023 or the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to such date, the Issuer will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes of each series at a redemption price equal to 100% of the original offering price of each series of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such mandatory redemption. See “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Use of Proceeds.” There can be no assurance that the Mergers will be consummated on the terms described herein or at all. Absence of Established Market for the Notes ........................ Each series of notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently no market. Although certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the notes, such initial purchasers are not obligated to do so, and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we and the Issuer cannot assure you that a liquid market for any series of notes will develop or be maintained. Trustee .................................... U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association. 23 ----- Escrow Agent .......................... U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association. Risk Factors ............................

Listing and Trading ................. No public market currently exists for the notes. Neither we nor the Issuer intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of any series of notes in any automated quotation system. 24 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Ritchie Bros.” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” Pro forma EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expenses, interest expense and income tax expense, and subtracting interest income from pro forma net income. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA represents pro forma EBITDA adjusted to add back share-based payments expense, acquisition-related costs, loss (gain) on disposition of property, plant and equipment and related costs, certain non-recurring advisory, legal and restructuring costs, change in fair value of derivatives and the fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration. Certain historical adjustments which are included in IAA Adjusted EBITDA and meet Ritchie Bros.’ definition have been included and adjusted for in the adjusted pro forma EBITDA. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the reasons why management believes adjusted pro forma EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, also for a discussion of the analytical limitations of these measures. (2) Adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders is derived from financial information contained elsewhere in this offering circular. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Ritchie Bros.” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” Adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders is calculated from pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders adding back adjusting items that we do not consider to be part of our normal operating results, such as share-based payments expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and loss (gain) on disposition of property, plant and equipment and related costs. Also adjusted were certain non-recurring advisory, legal and restructuring costs, the change in fair value of derivatives, loss on redemption and extinguishment of indebtedness and related interest expense, and the fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration. Certain historical adjustments which are included in IAA’s adjusted net income and meet Ritchie 26 ----- Bros. definition have been included and adjusted for in the adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders. (3) Pro forma gross leverage is calculated by dividing pro forma total debt (excluding debt issuance costs and capital lease obligations) by adjusted pro forma EBITDA. Pro forma net leverage is calculated by dividing pro forma net debt by adjusted pro forma EBITDA. Pro forma net secured leverage is calculated by dividing pro forma net secured debt by adjusted pro forma EBITDA. We believe that these measures provide useful information about the performance of our operations as an indication of the amount of time it would take us to settle both our short and long-term debt.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Ritchie Bros. also gives effect to other financing events contemplated by Ritchie Bros. or that have already occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical financial information of Ritchie Bros. and are considered material transactions separate from the Mergers. The Mergers will be treated as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022 have been derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” in this offering circular.

As of December 31, 2022, as adjusted for the Transactions, we would have had approximately $3,260.0 million of total debt (excluding debt issuance costs and capital lease obligations), including $2,460.0 million of secured indebtedness consisting of the secured notes offered hereby and $1,910.0 million under the Credit Agreement and $800.0 million of unsecured indebtedness consisting of the unsecured notes offered hereby, and we would have had $738.9 million of availability under the Credit Agreement after giving effect to the $11.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred pursuant to the Transactions, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take certain actions, including reducing spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry, including both the live and online auction industry, could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. 30 ----- In addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.

If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to any or all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, or may create additional risks. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate based on the term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). SOFR is a relatively new reference rate. The publication of SOFR began in April 2019, and, therefore, it has a very limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as United States dollar LIBOR. Additionally, any successor rate to SOFR under the Credit Agreement may not have the same characteristic as SOFR or LIBOR.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other insolvency laws, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee provided by a guarantor and, if payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that: - the guarantee was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the guarantor or other person or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the guarantor was insolvent when it granted the guarantee; - the guarantee was entered into without a legal obligation to do so, is prejudicial to the interests of the other creditors and both the guarantor and the beneficiary of the guarantee were aware of or should have been aware of the fact that it was prejudicial to the other creditors; - the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee and/or the guarantor: (i) became insolvent before the granting of the guarantee or was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the issuance of the guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the issuance of the guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the guarantee was held to exceed the objects of the guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the guarantor; - the guarantee was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or was voidable for another reason, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or such guarantor or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or other voidable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. In addition, the liability of a guarantor under its guarantee of the notes will be limited to the amount of such guarantee that does not constitute a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise result in such guarantee being set aside or otherwise voided. The amount recoverable from a guarantor may also be limited and there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in determining the liability of each guarantor. Also, there is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case, the guarantor’s entire liability may be extinguished. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine 35 ----- whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the related guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee if the Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case (i.e., liquidation). Similar rules exist under the applicable laws of certain foreign jurisdictions. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.” Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness,13.1.15,Any future guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.,"Guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Any future issuance of a guarantee, including pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued, may be avoidable by the guarantor (as a debtor 36 ----- in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the guarantor is insolvent at the time of the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the guarantee had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes had been issued, including with respect to IAA Holding and its subsidiaries, less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the guarantee.

The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the center of main interests, which should correspond to the place where the relevant debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. In European Union (“EU”) Member States and certain other jurisdictions, the determination of where Ritchie Bros., the Issuer or any of the guarantors has its “center of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States and other jurisdictions may have and had in the past differing and even conflicting views. Furthermore, “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees” for a description of the insolvency laws in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, Japan, Mexico, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United States, which could limit the enforceability of the guarantees. In the event that any one or more of Ritchie Bros., the Issuer, the guarantors, any future guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees and security provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering circular are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect the ability of holders of the notes offered hereby to enforce their rights under the guarantees or the security in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that holders of the notes may receive.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Future guarantors may be incorporated or organized in other foreign jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of a future guarantor. Your rights under the notes offered hereby and the guarantees will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, foreign exchange, administration and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from or in conflict with one another and those of the United States, including in respect of creditor’s rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The consequences of the multiple jurisdictions involved could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, which could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the notes offered hereby and the guarantees.

These subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of the notes. Moreover, to the extent any of these subsidiaries are not wholly-owned, we and/or the Issuer will receive only a portion of any distributions made by such subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition, operating requirements and other considerations, including local law, of these subsidiaries, may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

The court adjudicating that case might find that such escrow accounts are the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the escrow accounts will be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the special mandatory redemption price, the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without bankruptcy court approval. As a result, holders of the notes may not be able to have the escrow funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by indentures governing the notes and could suffer a loss as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for any series of notes. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so and any market making with respect to the notes may be discontinued at any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance regarding any future development of a trading market for any series of notes, the ability of holders of notes to sell their notes or the price at which such holders may be able to sell their notes. The ability of such initial purchasers to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes. If Ritchie Bros. were to cease being a reporting company under the SEC’s rules and regulations, the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 and regulatory interpretations thereof by the SEC could restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes being offered hereby on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025.

The guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indentures that will govern the notes. The indentures that will govern the notes also will permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a subsidiary guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor being automatically released. If a subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well if such subsidiary does not guarantee any other indebtedness. If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes.

In addition, the indenture that will govern the secured notes will permit us and the guarantors to create additional liens under specified circumstances, including liens senior in priority to the liens on the Collateral securing the secured notes.

Under the intercreditor agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control such proceedings will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the Credit Agreement until (i) our obligations under the Credit Agreement are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Credit Agreement) or (ii) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing debt secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral other than the Credit Agreement (including the indenture that will govern the secured notes) that is continuing, if the holders of such debt represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral (excluding the Credit Agreement), the authorized representative of such holders has complied with the applicable notice provisions and the collateral agent under the Credit Agreement has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to the Collateral. However, even if the authorized representative of the secured notes gains the right to direct the collateral agent in the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the Collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under the Credit Agreement) if the authorized representative of the lenders under the Credit Agreement has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that Collateral (whether our company or the applicable guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In addition, the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the notes will permit us, subject to certain limits, to issue additional series of notes or other debt that also have a first-priority lien on the same Collateral. At any time that the collateral agent under the Credit Agreement does not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the intercreditor agreement, the right to direct such actions will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. If we have, at such time, outstanding indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a _pari _passu basis with the secured notes and has a greater outstanding principal amount than the outstanding aggregate_ principal amount of the notes, then the authorized representative for such indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the intercreditor agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. Also, under the intercreditor agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the intercreditor agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, the holders of the notes may be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any Collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive. Under the intercreditor agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the secured notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of the shared Collateral to secure that financing, subject to conditions and limited exceptions.

We have not analyzed the effect of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections, and the existence thereof could adversely affect the value of the Collateral that will secure the secured notes, as well as the ability of the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the secured notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the secured notes from the sale of the collateral securing the secured notes and the obligations under the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the secured notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the secured notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, secured creditors are prohibited from repossessing their collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case without bankruptcy court approval and may be prohibited from disposing of collateral repossessed from such a debtor without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit the debtor to continue to retain collateral, including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments; provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but is intended generally to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral at the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times as the court, in its discretion, determines that a diminution in the value of the collateral occurs as a result of the stay of repossession or the disposition of the collateral during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent for the secured notes could foreclose upon or sell the collateral or whether or to what extent holders of secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the secured notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the secured notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the secured notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the secured notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the secured notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the secured notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the secured notes (including any pledge or guarantees provided after the Mergers Closing Date) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the secured notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 bankruptcy case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business,13.3.1,Damage to our reputation could harm our business.,"One of our founding principles is that we operate a fair and transparent business, and consistently act with integrity. Maintaining a positive reputation is key to our ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation could arise in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, employee conduct which is not aligned with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (and associated Company policies around behavioural expectations) or our Company’s core values, safety incidents, failure to maintain customer service standards, loss of trust in the fairness of our sales processes and other technology or compliance failures. 43 ----- In addition, following the Mergers, we will rely on independent subhaulers and trucking fleet operations to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from auction facilities. Consistent with the economy generally, there has recently been a shortage of towers and subhaulers, which has resulted in an increase in costs charged by towers and subhaulers for these services, and we cannot provide assurances that towers and subhaulers will be available in a timely manner to pick up and deliver vehicles. Failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely manner could harm our brand and reputation, and adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. Further, an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by independent subhaulers and trucking fleet operators, which may significantly increase our cost. We may not be able to pass these costs on to our suppliers or buyers. We will also be exposed to risks associated with inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure and increase in the price of fuel, any of which could increase our operating costs. If we experience problems or are unable to negotiate or obtain favorable terms with towers and subhaulers, our results of operations and our reputation could be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business,13.3.2,We may incur losses as a result of our guarantee and inventory contracts and advances to consignors.,"Our most common type of auction contract is a straight commission contract, under which we earn a pre-negotiated, fixed commission rate on the gross sales price of the consigned equipment at auction. We use straight commission contracts when we act as agent for consignors. In recent years, a majority of our annual business has been conducted on a straight commission basis. In certain other situations, we will enter into underwritten transactions and either offer to: - guarantee a minimum level of sale proceeds to the consignor, regardless of the ultimate selling price of the consignment; or - purchase the equipment outright from the seller for sale through one of our sales channels. We determine the level of guaranteed proceeds or inventory purchase price based on appraisals performed on equipment by our internal personnel. Inaccurate appraisals could result in guarantees or inventory values that exceed the realizable auction proceeds. In addition, a change in market values could also result in guarantee or inventory values exceeding the realizable auction proceeds. If auction proceeds are less than the guaranteed amount, our commission will be reduced, and we could potentially incur a loss, and, if auction proceeds are less than the purchase price we paid for equipment that we take into inventory temporarily, we will incur a loss. Because a majority of our auctions are unreserved, there is no way for us to protect against these types of losses by bidding on or acquiring any of the items at such auctions. In addition, we do not hold inventory indefinitely waiting for market conditions to improve. If our exposure to underwritten contracts increases, this risk would be compounded. Occasionally, we advance to consignors a portion of the estimated auction proceeds prior to the auction. We generally make these advances only after taking possession of the assets to be auctioned and upon receipt of a security interest in the assets to secure the obligation. If we were unable to auction the assets or if auction proceeds were less than amounts advanced, we could incur a loss. Additionally, we have two vendor contracts with the U.S. Government’s Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) pursuant to which we acquire, manage and resell certain assets of the DLA. Each of the DLA contracts obliges the Company to purchase rolling and non-rolling stock assets in an amount and of a type over which we have limited ability to control. In many cases, the type of assets purchased are not what we typically sell through any of our other channels. Although the prices we pay for the non-rolling stock inventory are a fraction of the original acquisition value, we may not have the ability to attract buyers for those assets and we may be unable to sell those assets on a timely basis or at all. This would have an adverse effect on our financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Following the Mergers, changes in the consignment patterns of key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. There are many factors that can adversely affect volume of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles from suppliers, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: a decrease in the number of vehicles in operation or miles driven; mild weather conditions that cause fewer traffic accidents; reduction of policy writing by insurance providers that would affect the number of claims over a period of time; increases in fuel prices that could lead to a reduction in the 44 ----- miles driven per vehicle, which may reduce the accident rate; changes in vehicle technology, an increase in autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems; a decrease in the percentage of claims resulting in a total loss or elimination of automotive collision coverage by consumers; delays or changes in state title processing; government regulations on the standards for producing vehicles; and changes in direct repair procedures that would reduce the number of newer, less damaged total loss vehicles, which tend to have higher salvage values. In periods when the supply of vehicles from the insurance sector declines, salvage operators have acquired and in the future may acquire vehicles on their own. Also, when used vehicle prices are high, used-vehicle dealers may retail more of their trade-in vehicles on their own rather than selling them at auction. If the supply or value of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles coming to auction declines significantly, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected. Furthermore, an increase in the number of damaged, total loss and low value vehicles we purchase could adversely affect our profitability. Operating on a principal basis, in which a vehicle is purchased and then resold, rather than on an agent basis, in which the auction acts as a sales agent for the owner of the vehicle, exposes us to inventory risks, including losses from theft, damage and obsolescence. If we purchase vehicles, the increased costs associated with acquiring the vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit margin and operating results. In addition, when vehicles are purchased, we are subject to changes in vehicle values, such as those caused by changes in commodity prices. Decreases in commodity prices, such as steel and platinum, may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at auctions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

As the malicious tools and techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, impair or sabotage IT systems and devices and the data processed or stored thereby, and infrastructure become more sophisticated and change frequently, the risk of a cybersecurity event increases, given that we may not be able to anticipate these malicious tools and techniques or to implement adequate preventative and protective measures. Unauthorized parties have in the past, and may also in the future, attempt to gain access to our and our providers’ primary and backup systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into IT systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our and their employees or contractors. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal and confidential information we store, there is a risk that these policies may not be effective in all cases. Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational loss and diversion of funds. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. There can be no assurance that impacts from these incidents will not be material or significant in the future. In addition, our limited control over our customers may affect the security and integrity of our IT systems and create financial or legal exposure. For example, our customers may accidentally disclose their passwords, use insecure passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen, providing bad actors with access to a customer’s account and the possible means to redirect customer payments. Further, users on our platforms could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platforms but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Under credit card payment rules and our contracts with credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information used to process transactions, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for certain fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers, including the cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. If we were liable for a significant number of fraudulent transactions or unable to accept payment cards, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Although we implement, maintain and adjust information security measures to mitigate our risks with respect to ITrelated cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will ensure that our operations are not disrupted, that we will prevent an attack from occurring in the future or that our internal controls relating to user access management will perform as intended to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data. Any breach of our IT systems may have a material adverse impact on our business, the assessment of the performance of our internal control environment, results of operations, reputation, stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and may also be deemed to contribute to a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. Security events, hacking or other malicious or surreptitious activity (or the perception that such activities have occurred), could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in the security of our services and thereby a loss of customers, and expose us to a risk of loss, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or litigation and possible liability for damages. We may be required to make significant expenditures and divert management attention to monitor, detect and prevent security events, to remediate known or potential security vulnerabilities or to alleviate problems caused by any security events. In addition, circumvention of our security measures may result in the loss or misappropriation of valuable business data, intellectual property or trade secret information, misappropriation of our customers’ or employees’ personal information, damage to our computing infrastructure, networks and stored data, service delays, key personnel being unable to perform duties or communicate throughout the organization, loss of sales, significant costs for data restoration and other adverse impacts on our business. Further, such a breach may require us to incur significant expenses to notify governmental agencies, individuals or other third parties pursuant to various privacy and security laws. 47 ----- The costs of mitigating cybersecurity risks are significant and are likely to increase in the future.

IAA has incurred and we may in the future incur expenditures relating to compliance and risk mitigation efforts, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant. IAA is currently conducting an investigation and the remediation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances contamination at a formerly leased site in Carteret, NJ, the costs of which are expected to be covered by insurance. In addition, federal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA’s role in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington and its subsidiary’s role in contributing to the Pyrite Canyon Plume in Jurupa Valley, California. The potential liability at these sites cannot be estimated at this time. In addition, auction sites that we acquire or lease in the future may be contaminated, and future use of or conditions on any of our properties or sites could result in contamination. The costs related to claims arising from environmental contamination of any of these properties could harm our financial condition and results of operations. There are restrictions in the United States, Canada, Europe and other jurisdictions in which we do business that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions or the salability of older equipment. One example of these restrictions is environmental certification requirements in the United States, which prevent non-certified equipment from entering into commerce in the United States. In addition, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those markets. 49 ----- These restrictions, or the adoption of more stringent environmental laws, including laws enacted in response to climate change, could inhibit materially the ability of customers to ship equipment to or from our auction sites, reducing our GTV and harming our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Such risk could be exacerbated after the consummation of the Mergers.","Our future success largely depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees in all areas of our business, as well as to design an appropriate organization structure and plan effectively for succession. Although we actively manage our human resource risks, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. If we fail to attract, develop and retain skilled employees in all areas of our business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not achieve our growth or performance objectives. The growth and performance of our business depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our employees. Many of our key employees have extensive experience with our business. These employees have knowledge and an understanding of our company and industry that cannot be readily duplicated. The loss of any key personnel, or the inability to replace any lost personnel with equally trained personnel, could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause us to lose customers and reduce our revenues. In addition, the success of our strategic initiatives to expand our business to complimentary service offerings will require new competencies in many positions, and our management and employees will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes or we are unable to attract new employees who are able to do so, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives. We do not maintain key person insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers or other key personnel. As a result, we would have no way to cover the financial loss if we were to lose the services of such employees. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of our key personnel were to join a competitor or form a competing company, existing and potential customers could choose to form business relationships with that competitor instead of us. There can be no assurance that confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition or similar agreements signed by our former directors, officers or employees will be effective in preventing a loss of business.

Such risk could be exacerbated after the consummation of the Mergers.,"Our employees and customers are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles and chemical and other industrial substances. Our auction sites and warehouses are, therefore, potentially dangerous places and involve the risk of accidents, environmental incidents and other incidents which may expose us to investigations and litigation or could negatively affect the perception of customer and employee safety, health and security. Even in the absence of any incidents, unsafe site conditions could lead to employee turnover or harm our reputation generally, each of which would affect our financial performance. While safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance, our failure to implement safety procedures, or implementation of ineffective safety procedures, would increase this risk and our operations and results from operations may be adversely impacted.

We accrue and pay income taxes and have significant income tax assets, liabilities and expense that are estimates based primarily on the application of those interpretations, regulations and legislation, and the amount and timing of future taxable income as well as our use of applicable accounting principles. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that our estimates and reserves are sufficient. The timing concerning the monetization of deferred income tax amounts is 50 ----- uncertain, as they are dependent on our future earnings and other events. Our deferred income tax amounts are valued based upon enacted income tax rates in effect at the time, which can be changed by governments in the future. The audit and review activities of tax authorities affect the ultimate determination of the actual amounts of commodity taxes payable or receivable, income taxes payable or receivable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and income tax expense. There is no assurance that taxes will be payable as anticipated or that the amount or timing of receipt or use of the taxrelated assets will be as currently expected. Our experience indicates that taxation authorities are increasing the frequency and depth of audits and reviews. The Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) has been conducting audits for our 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years. On February 13, 2023, the CRA issued a proposal letter to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (International) Ltd., asserting that one of its Luxembourg subsidiaries was resident in Canada from 2010 to 2015 and that its worldwide income should be subject to Canadian income taxation. In the event that the CRA issues a notice of assessment or reassessment, and a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final determination that the income of the Luxembourg subsidiary for 2010 through 2015 was subject to Canadian income tax laws, the Company may ultimately be liable for additional total Canadian federal and provincial income tax, interest and penalties for such period which could have a material negative effect on our operations. The CRA may also challenge the manner in which the Company has filed its tax returns and reported its income with respect to 2016 to 2020 taxation years and may assert that the income of the Luxembourg subsidiary was subject to Canadian income tax because the Luxembourg subsidiary was also resident in Canada during these years. The Company could then incur additional income taxes, penalties and interest which could have a material negative effect on our operations. In addition, future tax authority determinations, including changes to tax interpretations, regulations, legislation or jurisprudence, could have a material impact to our financial position. The fact that we operate internationally increases our exposure in this regard given the multiple forms of taxation imposed upon us. Further and more generally, there has been increased political, media and tax authority focus on taxation in recent years; the intent of which appears to be to enhance transparency and address perceived tax avoidance. As such, in addition to tax risk from a financial perspective, our activities may expose us to reputational risk.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Such risk could be exacerbated after the consummation of the Mergers.","We conduct business in many countries around the world and intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets, including emerging markets. Although we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are generated outside the U.S., primarily in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In particular, a significant portion of our revenues are earned, and expenses incurred, in the Canadian dollar and the Euro. The results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Euro, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. We do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements on any of our revenues or expenses. Fluctuating currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business in international markets and our related results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the different countries in which we conduct our operations impact the purchasing power of buyers, the motivation of consignors, asset values and asset flows between various countries, including those in which we do not have operations. These factors and other global economic conditions may harm our business and our results of operations. Such risks could be exacerbated after the consummation of the Mergers, as approximately 19% of IAA’s revenues were attributable to foreign operations for its fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. 51 ----- Other risks inherent in doing business internationally include, but are not limited to the following: (a) trade barriers, trade regulations, currency controls, import or export regulations and other restrictions on doing business freely; (b) local labor, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations, and the potential for adverse changes in such laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof; (c) difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; (d) economic, political, social or labor instability or unrest; (e) terrorism, war, hostage-taking or military repression; (f) corruption; (g) expropriation and nationalization, or difficulties in enforcing or protecting our property rights, including with respect to intellectual property; (h) increased exposure to high rates of inflation; and (i) unpredictability as to litigation in foreign jurisdictions and enforcement of local laws. If we violate the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, we may face fines, criminal actions or sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.

We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA, the CFPOA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international organizations and private-sector recipients for the corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA, the CFPOA or other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we leverage various third parties to sell our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. 52 ----- Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.

We protect our proprietary technology through a combination of trade secrets, third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, additional contractual restrictions on disclosure and use and patent, copyright and trademark laws. We are the registered owners of many Internet domain names internationally. As we seek to protect our domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, we may not be successful in doing so in certain jurisdictions. Our competitors may adopt trade names or domain names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to promote our marketplace and possibly leading to customer confusion. In addition, we could face trade name or trademark or service mark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks, including trademarks or service marks that may incorporate variations of our brand names. The legal means we use to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property do not afford complete protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot guarantee that any of our present or future intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us; our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; or our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak. We also may allow certain of our registered intellectual property rights, or our pending applications or registrations for intellectual property rights, to lapse or to become abandoned if we determine that obtaining or maintaining the applicable registered intellectual property rights is not worthwhile. 55 ----- Further, although it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent unauthorized use of our technology or infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights. Effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and domain name protection is time-consuming and expensive to maintain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. We may also be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. Companies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or misused other parties’ intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third-party intellectual property rights may cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. Many potential litigants, including some patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages, and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Such a license may be unavailable or may require us to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our intellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed.

We compete for potential purchasers and sellers of equipment with other auction companies and with non-auction competitors such as equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers, equipment rental companies and other online marketplaces. When sourcing equipment to sell at our auctions or other marketplaces, we compete with other onsite and online auction companies, OEM and independent dealers, equipment brokers, other third parties and equipment owners that have traditionally disposed of equipment in private sales. In addition, following the Mergers, we may also compete with direct competitors, new entrants, including new vehicle remarketing venues, and existing alternative vehicle remarketing venues, for the supply of damaged and total loss vehicles and the buyers of those vehicles. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we do. New competitors with greater financial and other resources and/or different business models/strategies may enter the equipment auction market in the future. Additionally, existing or future competitors may succeed in entering and establishing successful operations in new geographic markets prior to our entry into those markets. They may also compete against us through internet-based services and other combined service offerings. If commission rates decline, or if our strategy to compete against our many competitors is not effective, our revenues, market share, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. We may be susceptible to loss of business if competing selling models become more appealing to customers. If our selling model becomes undesirable or we are not successful in adding services complementary to our existing selling model and business, we may not be successful increasing market penetration over the long-term, which could prevent us from achieving our long-term earnings growth targets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Market competition, business requirements and financial conditions could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with our customers and business partners. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, or maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners, on acceptable terms, or at all. The loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, following the Mergers, business will depend, in part, on suppliers of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles, including insurance companies, used-vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet lease companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. Agreements with insurance company suppliers are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. There can be no assurance that IAA’s existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements on favorable terms with these suppliers following the Mergers. From time to time, however, we may experience the loss of suppliers or a reduction in volume from suppliers, including top vehicle suppliers. If we lose one or more significant suppliers, or if one or more large suppliers were to significantly reduce volume for any reason or favor competitors or new entrants, we may not be successful in replacing such business and our profitability and operating results could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

We have no control over 57 ----- any of the factors that affect the supply of or demand for used equipment and the circumstances that cause market values for equipment to fluctuate including, among other things, economic uncertainty, the global geopolitical climate, disruptions to credit and financial markets, lower commodity prices and our customers’ restricted access to capital. Recent economic conditions have caused fluctuations in the supply, mix and market values of used equipment available for sale, which has a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, a sustained reduction in used-vehicle pricing could result in lower proceeds from the sale of damaged and total loss vehicles and a related reduction in revenue per vehicle, a potential loss of consignors and decreased profitability. Conversely, when used vehicle prices are high, used-vehicle dealers may retail more of their trade-in vehicles on their own rather than selling them at auction, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, price competition and the availability of equipment directly affect the supply of, demand for and market value of used equipment.

Our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”), pursuant to which we issued one right in respect of each common share outstanding. Under the Rights Plan, following a transaction in which any person becomes an “acquiring person” as defined in the Rights Plan, each right will entitle the holder to receive a number of common shares provided in the Rights Plan. The purposes of the Rights Plan are (i) to provide our board of directors time to consider value-enhancing alternatives to a take-over bid and to allow competing bids to emerge; (ii) to ensure that shareholders are provided equal treatment under a take-over bid; and (iii) to give adequate time for shareholders to properly assess a take-over bid without undue pressure. The Rights Plan can potentially impose a significant penalty on any person commencing a takeover bid that would result in the offeror becoming the beneficial owner of 20% or more of our outstanding common shares.

In connection with the Mergers, we entered into the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to which the initial lenders thereunder committed to provide (i) the Backstop Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750 million and (ii) the senior secured 364day Bridge Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.8 billion. We obtained amendments to our Existing Credit Agreement to terminate the backstop commitments (including the Backstop Revolving Facility and $88.9 million of bridge commitments that served as a backstop for our existing term loans) and replace $1.825 billion of bridge commitments with the New Term Loan A Facility. The proceeds of this offering will extinguish the remaining commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash is subject in part to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. The combined company’s substantial indebtedness could have adverse effects on the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations, including: - increasing its vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions; - limiting its ability to compete and its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry; - limiting its ability to borrow additional funds to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; - expose it to the risk of increased interest rates for any borrowings at variable rates of interest; and - increasing its interest expense and requiring it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing funds available for dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and other purposes. The combined company’s ability to arrange any additional financing for the purposes described above or otherwise will depend on, among other factors, the combined company’s financial positions and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond their control.

Accordingly, under generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, Ritchie Bros., which is organized under the laws of Canada, generally would be classified as a foreign corporation. Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a foreign corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or to be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences) if it acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the assets held, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. corporation. These rules apply only if certain conditions are met, including that the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by reason of their ownership of shares of that corporation, more than a specified percentage of the shares of the acquiring foreign corporation. Based on the percentage of the Merger Consideration to be received by shareholders of IAA in the transaction that is comprised of common shares, these conditions are not expected to be met and thus our indirect acquisition of IAA is not expected to cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation (or to be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences) under Section 7874 of the Code. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not take a contrary position or that the relevant U.S. federal income tax law will not be changed (possibly with retroactive effect) in a manner that would result in a contrary conclusion. If it were determined that we are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, we could be subject to substantial U.S. tax liability and our non-U.S. shareholders could be subject to U.S. withholding tax on any dividends.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The identification and scope of these opportunities is based on various assumptions, which may or may not prove to be accurate. These opportunities for the combined company may not arise as expected, or the combined company may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from these opportunities, from the sources or in the amount, manner or time frame expected, or at all.

In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, all outstanding IAA equity awards (other than those that vest in accordance with their terms upon the First Merger) will be assumed by the Company. Based upon the estimated number of outstanding Ritchie Bros. common shares, outstanding shares of IAA Common Stock and outstanding equity awards and other convertible securities of the parties, in each case as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Mergers, Ritchie Bros. and IAA estimate that, upon completion of the Mergers, the existing Ritchie Bros. shareholders are expected to own approximately 62.8% of the outstanding common shares (of which approximately 3.7% will be owned by the Starboard purchasers on a fully diluted basis) and former IAA stockholders are expected to own approximately 37.2% of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis. Each party has agreed to call a meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote on (i) in the case of the Company, the Ritchie Bros. Share Issuance Proposal, and (ii) in the case of IAA, among other things, the IAA Merger Proposal. The closing of the Mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, among other things, (a) the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval, (b) the IAA Stockholder Approval, (c) the approval for listing by the NYSE and the TSX of our common shares to be issued in the First Merger, (d) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each of us and IAA contained in the Merger Agreement and the compliance by each party with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, (e) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each of the Company (with respect to IAA’s obligations) and IAA (with respect to our obligations) and (f) other customary closing conditions. Ritchie Bros. currently expects the Mergers to close in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions. There is no guarantee that the Mergers will close within the anticipated timeframe or at all. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of the Company, the Issuer, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and IAA, including, among others, covenants by each of the Company and IAA to use its reasonable efforts to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects between the date of signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Mergers and prohibiting the parties from engaging in certain kinds of activities during such period without the consent of the other party. Each of the Company and IAA has agreed to customary non-solicitation covenants that prohibit them from soliciting competing proposals or entering into discussions or negotiations or providing confidential information in connection with certain proposals for an alternative transaction. These non-solicitation provisions allow the Company and IAA, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations under the Merger Agreement, to provide nonpublic information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties in response to an unsolicited 69 ----- competing proposal. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the boards of directors of the Company and IAA may change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Mergers in response to an unsolicited competing proposal that such board determines is more favorable to the Company shareholders or IAA stockholders, respectively, than the Mergers, or another intervening event as specified in the Merger Agreement, if such board of directors determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Merger Agreement contains customary termination rights for the Company and IAA, including if (i) the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval or the IAA Stockholder Approval is not obtained, (ii) the Mergers are not consummated by the Outside Date or (iii) any law, order, decree, ruling or judgment permanently prohibits completion of the Mergers. The Merger Agreement also provides certain termination rights for the benefit of each party, including (A) if the other party’s board of directors changes its recommendation to stockholders in relation to the Mergers, (B) for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the other party under the Merger Agreement (subject to certain procedures and materiality exceptions) and (C) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company or IAA, as applicable, would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $189 million. In addition, the Amendment provides that, in the event that either the Company or IAA elects to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the Company’s failure to obtain the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval, the Company would be required to reimburse IAA for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by IAA in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Mergers up to a maximum amount of $5.0 million. The Merger Agreement provides that, as of immediately following the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company will consist of twelve members, of whom (i) eight directors will be designated by the Company, which designees will consist of: Erik Olsson, who will continue as Chair of the board of directors; Ann Fandozzi, who will continue as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and six existing directors of the Company who are independent under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and applicable Canadian securities laws as designated by the Company; and (ii) four directors of IAA, three of whom are independent under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and applicable Canadian securities laws, as designated by IAA. The Amendment also permits the Company to pay a one-time, special cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders not to exceed $1.08 per share, with a record date prior to the Effective Time to be determined by the board of directors of the Company with the consent of the TSX and payment conditioned upon the closing of the First Merger. This offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers, but in certain circumstances we may be required to redeem the notes. See “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption.” The Mergers and the Merger Agreement have been approved by the board of directors of Ritchie Bros. _Investment Transaction_ On January 22, 2023, the Company entered into the SPA with the Starboard purchasers and, for certain purposes, Starboard Value LP and Jeffrey C. Smith, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Starboard purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the prospectus requirements of British Columbia securities law, (i) an aggregate of 485,000,000 Preferred Shares, which Preferred Shares are convertible into the Company’s common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $485.0 million, or $1.00 per Preferred Share, and (ii) an aggregate of 251,163 common shares of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $15.0 million, or $59.722 per common share of the Company. The closing of the Investment Transaction occurred on February 1, 2023. Holders of the Preferred Shares will receive annual dividends on a cumulative basis initially equal to 5.5% of the aggregate principal amount of $485.0 million and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each calendar year in cash or in common shares at Ritchie Bros.’ election. The Preferred 70 ----- Shares are participating securities and will also participate on an as-converted basis in any regular dividends paid to common shareholders, subject to a $0.27 per share per quarter floor. Pursuant to the articles of amendment of Ritchie Bros. governing the Preferred Shares, holders of the Preferred Shares will have redemption rights upon consummation of a change of control of Ritchie Bros. to require Ritchie Bros. to repurchase the Preferred Shares at an amount in cash equal to the applicable conversion price plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, plus a make whole premium. Holders of the Preferred Shares also have non-contingent rights to convert the Preferred Shares into Ritchie Bros. common shares. The conversion rate will initially be 0.0136986 Ritchie Bros. common shares per $1.00 conversion amount, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment provisions, including an adjustment for the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend to be paid in connection with the Mergers. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, upon obtaining the Ritchie Bros. Shareholder Approval and the IAA Stockholder Approval, the Company will increase the size of its board of directors from nine to ten directors and appoint Jeffrey C. Smith, who serves as Managing Member, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Starboard Value LP, as a member of the board of directors of the Company. _Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend_ On January 23, 2023, the Company announced that the board of directors of the Company expects to approve the payment of the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend to the Company’s shareholders in the amount of $1.08 per share, contingent upon the closing of the First Merger. The Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Company’s common shares as of a record date prior to the Effective Time to be determined with the consent of the TSX and only if the First Merger is completed. The Company’s shareholders will only be eligible to receive the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend if they own their common shares through the record date determined for the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend, which will be publicly announced by the Company following determination. IAA stockholders will not be entitled to receive the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend with respect to any common shares received as consideration in the First Merger. The Company will not pay the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend if the Merger Agreement is terminated or the First Merger is otherwise not completed for any reason. _Cooperation Agreement_ On January 22, 2023, IAA and Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (“Ancora”) entered into a cooperation agreement regarding the Mergers and related transactions, the membership and composition of the IAA board of directors in certain circumstances and related matters. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, IAA has agreed to take all actions necessary pursuant to the Merger Agreement to designate Timothy James O’Day as an IAA designee for appointment to the board of directors of the combined company immediately following the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the completion of customary vetting and onboarding matters.

The procurement of the consents and the New Term Loan A Facility under the Sixth Amendment allowed us to (i) terminate the commitments for the Backstop Revolving Facility; and (ii) reduce the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility by an amount equal to the amount of the Term Loan A Facility. At our option, borrowings under the revolving facility and the Term Loan A Facility will, commencing on the Mergers Closing Date and the borrowing of the loans under the New Term Loan A Facility, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, (A) for U.S. dollar borrowings, either a base rate, a daily fluctuating rate based on term SOFR, or an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, (B) for Canadian dollar borrowings, a Canadian prime rate or an adjusted CDOR rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin and (C) for borrowings in alternative currencies, based on benchmark rates, plus an applicable margin, in each case, substantially consistent with our Existing Credit Agreement. Commencing on the Mergers Closing Date, the applicable margin for loans under the revolving facility and Term Loan A Facility will range from (x) 1.75-3.00% for alternative currency borrowings and for U.S. dollar borrowings with an adjusted term SOFR rate and (y) 0.75-2.00% for borrowings in Canadian dollars with a prime rate and for U.S. dollar borrowings with a base rate. Upon consummation of the Mergers, the applicable margin for the revolving facility and the Term Loan A Facility will increase by 0.25% if we do not receive at least $800 million of net cash proceeds from this offering of unsecured notes. The new TLA lenders’ obligation to fund the New Term Loan A Facility (and our ability to draw up to $200 million on the revolver) on the Mergers Closing Date is subject to limited conditions as set forth in the Sixth Amendment and consistent with those in the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, including, among others, completion of the Mergers, the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as defined in the Sixth Amendment) on IAA, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to Ritchie Bros. and IAA, the delivery of certain financial statements of Ritchie Bros. and IAA and other customary limited conditions to completion. The commitments of the new TLA lenders will terminate on the commitment termination date.

Additionally, we will not, without the prior written consent of IAA (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), take any action or enter into any transaction that would or would be reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the funding of all or any portion of the cash amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund all cash amounts required to be paid by us on the Mergers Closing Date, including the Merger Consideration, any cash fees under the Debt Commitment Letter and all related expenses owed, each due and payable at closing, and upon reasonable written 72 ----- request IAA, we will keep IAA informed, in all reasonable detail on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status of our efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing.

Ritchie Bros. is determined to be the accounting acquirer and IAA is determined to be the accounting acquiree. This determination was primarily based on the transfer of cash consideration by Ritchie Bros. to the former economic interest holders of IAA and the relative share ownership, voting rights, composition of the governing body, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined entity. Under this method of accounting, the purchase price of the Mergers will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary fair values at the Mergers Closing Date.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, Ritchie Bros. entered into the Debt Commitment Letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Bridge Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.8 billion and the Backstop Revolving Facility in an aggregate 74 ----- principal amount of up to $750.0 million. Ritchie Bros. subsequently obtained the Sixth Amendment to its Existing Credit Agreement which, among other things, permitted the Mergers and served to terminate the backstop commitments (including the Revolving Backstop Facility and $88.9 million of bridge commitments that served as a backstop for its existing term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement) and replace an additional $1.825 billion of bridge commitments with the New Term Loan A Facility. See “The Transactions—Financing of the Mergers” for additional information. The applicable interest rate on the Term Loan A Facility, assuming it is borrowed in U.S. Dollars at the adjusted term SOFR rate under the Sixth Amendment, will be determined at the then-current interest rate at the time of issuance and has been currently, as of the date of this offering circular, estimated to be 7.4% on February 17, 2023, which is the most recent practicable date for the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Ritchie Bros. plans to offer hereby $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of secured notes at an estimated rate, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, of 6.75% and $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes at an estimated rate, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, of 7.75%. Ritchie Bros. intends to borrow a total of $3.3 billion, including the Term Loan A Facility, that will be used to (a) finance the Mergers, (b) pay transaction costs, (c) repay certain existing indebtedness of IAA, (d) repay or refinance all existing indebtedness of Ritchie Bros. and (e) pay the Ritchie Bros. Special Dividend. These agreements, assumptions and expectations are subject to change, and the debt issuance costs to be incurred and related interest expense could vary significantly from what is assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Other factors that are subject to change include, but are not limited to, the timing of borrowings, the amount of cash on hand at the time of the closing and inputs to interest rate determination on debt instruments issued. Debt issuance costs are expected to be incurred for the New Term Loan A Facility, the secured notes and the unsecured notes and will be amortized over the respective terms of the debt.

Assumptions and estimates underlying the unaudited pro forma adjustments set forth in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are described in the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 is prepared on a combined basis using the historical audited consolidated balance sheets of Ritchie Bros. and IAA as of December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2023, respectively, giving pro forma effect to the Mergers and the other related events contemplated by the Merger Agreement as if each had been consummated on December 31, 2022 based on the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.

The differences that may occur between the preliminary estimates and the final purchase price allocation when the valuation and other studies are finalized could be material. The fair value assigned to intangible assets has been estimated based on third-party preliminary valuation studies utilizing income-based methodologies and corroborated with publicly available market benchmarks. The preliminary land fair value estimation was based on broker valuations, tax appraisals and other information provided by IAA management. The estimated fair values of land are preliminary and subject to a valuation assessment post-close. Other property, plant and equipment and working capital amounts are assumed to have fair values equal to historical book values.

The difference between the estimated total Merger Consideration and preliminary identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as estimated goodwill. The preliminary purchase price and purchase price allocation are presented in Note 3 above. Upon completion of the fair value assessment after the Mergers, it is anticipated that the ultimate purchase price allocation will differ from the preliminary assessment outlined here. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities, and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill. Final consideration will be determined at the closing of the Mergers. Prepaid consigned vehicle charges include inbound tow, titling costs and enhancement charges associated with the receipt of a consigned vehicle for auction. These costs are incurred by IAA and are not reimbursable. Because Ritchie Bros. will not receive a future economic benefit from these deferred costs, they do not qualify for asset recognition in the Mergers. The identifiable net assets acquired includes a deferred tax liability which is associated with the preliminary purchase price allocation and the pro forma adjustments. These purchase accounting adjustments create new differences between the book basis and tax basis of the respective 87 ----- assets. The amount of these adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is determined by applying the blended statutory rate of approximately 24% to the portion of these adjustments assuming all assets are within U.S. jurisdictions. The acquired right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the remaining future lease payments using Ritchie Bros.’ incremental borrowing rates. The current portion of the lease liability is calculated as the present value of the contractual lease payments for the subsequent twelve months. No amounts were recorded in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements related to the lease adjustment as the amount is not material. The assumed liabilities include a one-time one percent excise tax incurred on the cash consideration that increases the repurchase excise tax base for IAA concurrent with the Mergers.

The two-class method requires income available to common shareholders for the period to be allocated between shares of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive earnings as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. The Preferred Shares of the combined entity are participating securities that contractually entitle the holders of such shares to participate in the combined entity’s earnings but do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the combined entity’s losses. The pro forma basic net income per share attributable to the combined entity’s common shareholders is calculated using the historical basic weighted average shares of Ritchie Bros. common shares outstanding, adjusted for the additional new shares of Ritchie Bros. common stock to be issued to consummate the Mergers, and the new shares of Ritchie Bros. common stock issued and sold to the Starboard purchasers. Pro forma diluted net income per share attributable to the combined entity’s common shareholders is calculated using the historical diluted weighted average shares of Ritchie Bros. common shares outstanding, adjusted for the additional new shares of Ritchie Bros. common stock to be issued to consummate the Mergers, and the new shares of Ritchie Bros. common stock issued and sold to the Starboard purchasers, and the potentially dilutive effect of the exchanged IAA options, IAA RSU awards and IAA PRSU awards.

The pro forma non-GAAP metrics included in this offering circular are not required to be calculated in accordance with Item 10 of Regulation S-K. We regularly review the following non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections and make business decisions. The measures set forth below should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP or the unaudited pro forma financial information presented in this offering circular. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. The pro forma non-GAAP 90 ----- measures are presented herein because these are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses acquisition targets. Moreover, they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. The unaudited pro forma non-GAAP financial measures were derived from and should be read in conjunction with the following SEC filings and incorporated exhibits, which are incorporated by reference in this offering circular: - the non-GAAP financial information of Ritchie Bros. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 set forth under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Ritchie Bros.’ Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023; and - the non-GAAP financial information as of and for the year ended January 1, 2023 included within Exhibit 99.1 of IAA’s Current Report (excluding any information and exhibits furnished under Item 2.02 or 7.01) on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders have limitations as analytical measures, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that the non-GAAP measures: - do not reflect interest income, interest expense or other non-operating gains and losses, which may represent an increase to or reduction in cash available to us; - exclude non-cash charges for depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, adjusted pro forma EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; - do not reflect acquisition costs, restructuring costs, litigation costs or other costs that we do not consider to be routine in nature for the ongoing financial performance of our business, which may represent a reduction in cash available to us; - exclude non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to continue to be part of our compensation strategy; - do not reflect provisions for income taxes, which may represent a reduction in cash available to us. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and subtracting interest income from pro forma net income, as well as adding back share-based payments expense, acquisition-related costs, loss (gain) on disposition of property, plant and equipment and related costs, certain non-recurring advisory, legal and restructuring costs, change in fair value of derivatives, and the fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration. Certain historical adjustments which are included in IAA Adjusted EBITDA, and meet Ritchie Bros.’ definition, have been included and adjusted for in the adjusted pro forma EBITDA reconciliation below. Adjusted pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders eliminates the financial impact of adjusting items from pro forma net income attributable to common stockholders that we do not consider to be part of our normal operating results, such as share-based payments expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and loss (gain) on disposition of property, plant and equipment and related costs.

In addition, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, if any actual or potential conflict of interest arises for a director, the director is expected to promptly inform the Chair of the board of directors and the CEO of the Company. If a significant conflict exists and cannot be resolved, the director is expected to resign. All directors are expected to recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal business or interests. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The procurement of the consents and the New Term Loan A Facility under the Sixth Amendment allowed us to (i) terminate the commitments for the Backstop Revolving Facility; and (ii) reduce the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility by an amount equal to the amount of the Term Loan A Facility. At our option, borrowings under the revolving facility and the New Term Loan A Facility will, commencing on the Mergers Closing Date and the borrowing of the loans under the Term Loan A Facility, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, (A) for U.S. dollar borrowings, either a base rate, a daily fluctuating rate based on term SOFR, or an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, (B) for Canadian dollar borrowings, a Canadian prime rate or an adjusted CDOR rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin and (C) for borrowings in alternative currencies, based on benchmark rates, plus an applicable margin, in each case, substantially consistent with our Existing Credit Agreement. Commencing on the Mergers Closing Date, the applicable margin for loans under the revolving facility and Term Loan A Facility will range from (x) 1.75-3.00% for alternative currency borrowings and for U.S. dollar borrowings with an adjusted term SOFR rate and (y) 0.75-2.00% for borrowings in Canadian dollars with a prime rate and for U.S. dollar borrowings with a base rate. Upon consummation of the Mergers, the applicable margin for the revolving facility and the Term Loan A Facility will increase by 0.25% if we do not receive at least $800 million of net cash proceeds from this offering of unsecured notes. The new TLA lenders’ obligation to fund the New Term Loan A Facility (and our ability to draw up to $200 million on the revolver) on the Mergers Closing Date is subject to limited conditions as set forth in the Sixth Amendment and consistent with those in the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, including, among others, completion of the Mergers, the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as defined in the Sixth Amendment) on IAA, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to Ritchie Bros. and IAA, the delivery of certain financial statements of Ritchie Bros. and IAA and other customary limited conditions to completion. The commitments of the new TLA lenders will terminate on the commitment termination date. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets, subject to certain exceptions, of the Company and the guarantors organized in the United States and Canada. The Credit Agreement does not require any guarantor organized outside of the United States or Canada to pledge any of its property or assets to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on September 21, 2026 and, as of December 9, 2022, provided credit facilities or commitments totaling $2.660 billion with a syndicate of lenders comprising: (1) multicurrency revolving facilities of up to $750 million (the “Revolving Facilities”) and (2) a Term Loan A Facility of up to $1.910 billion (together with the Revolving Facilities, the “Credit Facilities”). Except with respect to our ability to borrow up to $200 million on the Mergers Closing Date as described above, our ability to borrow under our Revolving Facilities is subject to compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that could limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; (iii) make loans, advances or other investments; (iv) incur liens; 94 ----- (v) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; and (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also provides for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement to be declared immediately due and payable.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The relative rights among the creditors of the Credit Facilities Obligations and the holders of the other Parity Lien Obligations (including the holders of the secured notes) will be governed by the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement as set forth below under the caption “—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets and property of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors other than the Excluded Assets and other than any assets released from the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral will not include the property and assets of any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor. The Collateral will exclude the following assets and property (“Excluded Assets”), including, without limitation: (1) any owned or leased real property; 102 ----- (2) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Issuer and the Notes Collateral Agent, any IP Rights (i) for which a perfected Lien thereon is not effected either by filing of a UCC financing statement, a PPSA financing statement or by appropriate evidence of such Lien being filed in either the United States Copyright Office, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or (ii) that consist of any intent to use trademark application prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under applicable U.S. federal law; (3) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Issuer and the Notes Collateral Agent, any personal property (in the case of the UCC or the PPSA), in each case other than property described in clause (2) above, for which the attachment or perfection of a Lien thereon is not governed by the UCC or the PPSA, as applicable, any motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title that any of Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor takes interests in (whether as consignee or purchaser) for the purposes of selling at auction, to the extent that a security interest therein cannot be perfected by filing a UCC or PPSA financing statement; (4) letter of credit rights (other than to the extent such rights can be perfected by filing a UCC or a PPSA financing statement); (5) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Federal Reserve Board) and pledges and security interests prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation or agreements with any Governmental Authority or which would require governmental (including regulatory) consent, approval, license or authorization to provide such security interest unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received, in each case, after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of the UCC, the PPSA or any other applicable law; (6) (A) any Equity Interests of a Person to the extent that, and for so long as (i) such Equity Interests constitute less than 100% of all Equity Interests of such Person, and the Person or Persons holding the remainder of such Equity Interests are not Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the granting of a security interest in such Equity Interests in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent are not permitted by the terms of such issuing Person’s Organization Documents or otherwise require the consent of a Person or Persons who are not Restricted Subsidiaries of Parent (other than any approval or consent that may be required from the board of directors or shareholders of any Canadian Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to its constating documents), other than to the extent that any such law, rule, regulation, term, prohibition, restriction or condition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to the UCC, the PPSA or any other applicable law (including Debtor Relief Laws) or principles of equity, (B) any Equity Interests of any Excluded CFC Entity other than 65% (or such greater percentage that (i) could not reasonably be expected to cause the undistributed earnings of such Excluded CFC Entity or of the Excluded CFC Entities owned by such Excluded CFC Entity as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, to be treated as a deemed dividend for United States federal income tax purposes and (ii) could not reasonably be expected to cause any material adverse tax consequences) of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests entitled to vote (within the meaning of Treas.

The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the secured notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the secured notes and the Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of Parity Lien Obligations, including the holders of the secured notes. The Fair Market Value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual Fair Market Value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a insolvency or liquidation proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay Parent’s, the Issuer’s and the other Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the secured notes and the Guarantees. Under U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the secured notes from the sale of Collateral securing the secured notes and the Obligations in respect of the secured notes and the Guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of Parent’s, the Issuer’s and the other Guarantors’ other unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue additional notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur Parity Lien Obligations that would be secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by the Collateral. The ability of the holders to realize on the Collateral would also be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral for the Secured Notes—Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in certain collateral in the future.” To the extent any such security interest could not be created or perfected by such date, Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all acts and things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and enforceable and perfected, subject to certain permitted exceptions, including exceptions based on immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets as set forth in the Collateral Documents, to the extent required by the Secured Notes Indenture or the Collateral Documents within 90 days (or such later date as the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) of the Issue Date; provided that Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors will enter into security agreements and file UCC financing or PPSA financing (or equivalent) statements on the Issue Date; _provided, further, that that certificated equity of IAA and its subsidiaries shall be delivered within five Business Days of the Issue Date (subject to extensions reasonably agreed by the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent). There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the secured notes that all assets or properties contemplated to be pledged as security for the secured notes will be pledged, or that we hold the 105 ----- personal property interests we represent we hold or that we may pledge such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such personal property interests other than those permitted by the Secured Notes Indenture. Delivery of security interests or perfection thereof in Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the security interests could be avoidable in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Additionally, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Collateral Documents entered into in connection with the secured notes will not require us to take any actions to create, perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the secured notes (a) with respect to any assets located outside of the United States or Canada, (b) in any non-U.S. or non-Canadian jurisdiction or (c) as required by the laws of any non-U.S. or non-Canadian jurisdiction to create, perfect or maintain any security interest or otherwise.

On the Issue Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will, together with the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, enter into the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to set forth their relative rights in the Collateral, which will provide for the pari passu nature of their Liens, including any Liens that may, in the future, secure additional Parity Lien Indebtedness. If any other Indebtedness is designated as Parity Lien Indebtedness and is permitted by the terms of the Secured Notes Indenture to be secured by the Collateral, the representatives of the holders of such other Indebtedness will also become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of the secured notes to, among other things, add other parties. Holders will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement by their acceptance of the secured notes. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things, (1) that Liens on the Collateral securing the secured notes and other Obligations, the Credit Facilities Obligations under the Secured Notes Indenture and any other Parity Lien Indebtedness will be pari passu and that all distributions in respect of the Collateral will (as set forth in further detail below) be shared ratably among the holders of the secured notes and other secured parties under the Secured Notes Indenture, the secured parties in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness and (2) for certain procedures for exercising rights and remedies in respect of the Liens on the Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, as the Applicable Collateral Agent on the Issue Date, will have the exclusive right (subject to limited exceptions) to exercise remedies and take enforcement actions relating to the Collateral until the earlier of (a) such date as the Credit Facilities Obligations (and any designated refinancings thereof) have been paid in full and (b) 180 days after the occurrence and continuance of an event of default (and notice to the other collateral agents thereof) under the Secured Notes Indenture or the documents governing any other Parity Lien Indebtedness with the largest outstanding principal amount (to the extent the outstanding principal amount of secured notes or such other obligations, as applicable, is larger than the outstanding principal amount of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), as applicable, and the acceleration of the obligations thereunder unless (i) at any time the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent or other Applicable Collateral Agent, as applicable, has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral, (ii) Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor that has granted a security interest in the Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (iii) if the acceleration of the obligations of the series with respect to which such non controlling representative (if any) is rescinded in accordance with the terms of the applicable document (such date, the “Non-Controlling _Representative Enforcement Date”)._ 106 ----- After the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date, the Notes Collateral Agent (to the extent the outstanding principal amount of obligations under the secured notes is larger than the principal outstanding amount of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and any other Parity Lien Indebtedness) or the representative of holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of Parity Lien Indebtedness, as applicable, as the Applicable Collateral Agent, will have the exclusive right to exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral. As such, if other Parity Lien Indebtedness is outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding secured notes at such time, such other Parity Lien Indebtedness, as the Applicable Collateral Agent, may be able to direct the applicable representative with respect to matters related to the Collateral (including the commencement and continuation of enforcement proceedings with respect to the Collateral, controlling the conduct of such proceedings and, in connection therewith, approving releases of the Collateral) without consent from the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the secured notes. In either case, the Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date will not occur, and the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent will remain the Applicable Collateral Agent (even after the passage of the 180 day period described in clause (b) of “Non-Controlling Representative Enforcement Date”) to the extent the outstanding principal amount of obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is equal to or greater than the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the secured notes and any other Parity Lien Indebtedness. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, as the Applicable Collateral Agent, is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor or the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any other Parity Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) or with respect to any Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Collateral received by the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any other Parity Lien shall be applied by the Applicable Collateral Agent ratably to the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and any other Parity Lien Representatives in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement for further distribution to the holders of the secured notes, the holders of Credit Facilities Obligations and the holders of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness (to be applied in accordance with the applicable secured debt documents). If, at any time, any Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of, in each case, in connection with any enforcement by the Credit Facilities Collateral Agent, as the Applicable Collateral Agent, then the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and the holders of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon final conclusion of such disposition as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such Collateral are released and discharged; _provided that any proceeds of any Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied as described above. If in connection with any such foreclosure or other exercise of remedies by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the equity interests of any Person are foreclosed upon or otherwise disposed of and the Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the property or assets of such Person constituting Collateral, then the Liens of the Collateral Agent and the holders of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness with respect to any Collateral consisting of the property or assets of such Person constituting Collateral will be automatically released and discharged to the same extent as the Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent are released and discharged.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1064,DESCRIPTION OF SECURED NOTES,1064.7,Foreclosure,1064.7.1,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,"In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Notes Collateral Agent to obtain possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar laws if Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor were to have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief, bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate arrangement, winding-up or similar laws in any applicable jurisdiction) prior to the Notes Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited by the automatic stay from obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code and other debtor relief, insolvency, corporate arrangement or similar laws permit the debtor in certain circumstances to continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy or insolvency filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections that may be afforded to a secured creditor. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the secured notes could be made 109 ----- following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any Parity Lien Indebtedness) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the secured notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the secured notes would be “undersecured” and the holders of the secured notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. In addition, Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor (or any trustee or similar official appointed therefor) or creditors of Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or otherwise under the Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law.

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Issuer must send a written notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall state, among other things, the purchase date, which (unless otherwise required by law) must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). Holders electing to have a secured note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the secured note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the secured note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.

In the event the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding secured notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer may seek third party financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would be able to obtain such financing. Neither the Board of Directors of the Issuer nor the Trustee may waive the covenant relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer upon the circumstances described herein, and restrictions in the Secured Notes Indenture described herein on the ability of the Issuer, Parent and Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness, to grant liens on its property, to make Restricted Payments and to make Asset Sales may make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Issuer, whether favored or opposed by the management of the Issuer. Consummation of any such transaction in certain circumstances may require redemption or repurchase of the secured notes, and we cannot assure you that the Issuer or the acquiring party will have sufficient financial resources to effect such redemption or repurchase. Such restrictions and the restrictions on transactions with Affiliates may, in certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage any leveraged buyout of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries by the management of the Issuer. While such restrictions cover a wide variety of arrangements which have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions, the Secured Notes Indenture may not afford the Holders protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, amalgamation, merger or similar transaction. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of secured notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Change of Control” provisions of the Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Change of Control” provisions of the Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all secured notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding secured notes has been given pursuant to the Secured Notes Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of Parent to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred pursuant to and permitted under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent any Indebtedness would not be permitted to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” or any of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as Permitted Indebtedness under clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness and permitted to be refinanced under clause (16) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect during the entire period of time after the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and, accordingly, all Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of such covenant. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates,” all Affiliate Transactions entered into by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with an Affiliate of Parent during the applicable Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into on or prior to the Issue Date, and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Guarantors,” all contracts entered into during the applicable Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date. For purposes of the “—Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Net Cash Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. Notwithstanding the fact that covenants suspended during a Suspension Period may be reinstated, (1) no Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to have occurred, and none of Parent, the Issuer or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with such covenants during the Suspension Period or at the time such covenants are reinstated and (2) following a Reversion Date, Parent, the Issuer and each of Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. 117 ----- The Issuer shall give the Trustee written notice of any Suspension Event and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such Suspension Event has occurred. The Issuer shall give the Trustee written notice of any occurrence of a Reversion Date not later than five (5) Business Days after such Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Issuer and Parent will not, and will not permit any other Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness which by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) is expressly subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the secured notes or the applicable Guarantee, as the case may be, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or such Guarantor, as the case may be. For purposes of the foregoing all other purposes under the Secured Notes Indenture, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor solely by virtue of such Indebtedness being unsecured or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into one or more intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral securing such Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

It does not include all of the terms or provisions of the Secured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Escrow Agreement, the Collateral Documents or the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. We urge you to read the Secured Notes Indenture because it defines your rights. You can find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.” In this description (1) the term “Issuer” refers to Ritchie Bros. Holdings Inc., a Washington corporation, and not any of its Subsidiaries, (2) the term “Parent” refers to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated, a Canadian corporation and the parent of the Issuer, and (3) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer. The Issuer does not intend to list the secured notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer will not be required to, nor does the Issuer currently intend to, offer to exchange the secured notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the secured notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), or subject to the terms of, or incorporate any provision of, the TIA. Accordingly, the terms of the secured notes will include only those stated in the Secured Notes Indenture. Copies of the Secured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Escrow Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement may be obtained from the Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue $     million in aggregate principal amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “secured notes”) under an indenture (the “Secured Notes Indenture”) dated as of the Issue Date among Parent, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as notes collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). From and after the Escrow Release Date, or on the issue date of the secured notes if the Acquisition occurs concurrently with the consummation of this offering: - the secured notes and the Guarantees will be senior secured obligations of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors; - the secured notes and the Guarantees will rank equal in right of payment to all other senior obligations of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors (including the unsecured notes); - the secured notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral described below subject to certain Liens permitted under the Secured Notes Indenture; - the secured notes and the Guarantees will be pari passu with all existing and future indebtedness secured by a first-priority Lien on the Collateral (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities); - the secured notes and Guarantees will be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured debt (including the unsecured notes) and indebtedness secured by junior Liens of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors, in each case, to the extent of the Collateral securing the secured notes (after giving effect to the sharing of the value of such Collateral with holders of equal or prior ranking Liens on such Collateral); - the secured notes and the Guarantees will be effectively junior to any debt that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt; - the secured notes and Guarantees will also be structurally subordinated to any debt, preferred stock obligations and other liabilities of Parent’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors; and - the secured notes and the Guarantees will be senior in right of payment to all future Indebtedness, if any, of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the secured notes and the Guarantees. 97 ----- We expect that, following consummation of the Acquisition, IAA and each of its subsidiaries that becomes a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or a guarantor under the Unsecured Notes Indenture will also become a Guarantor of the secured notes. As of December 31, 2022, on a historical basis (without giving effect to the Transactions), (a) our existing subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors of the secured notes following the consummation of the Transactions had $72.7 million of liabilities (to which the secured notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $256.2 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances, and (b) IAA’s existing subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors of the secured notes following the consummation of the Transactions had $942.7 million of liabilities (to which the secured notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $1,721.9 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances. If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, prior to the Escrow Release Date, the secured notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, secured only by the Escrowed Property and senior unsecured obligations of Parent. The Issuer will issue the secured notes in fully registered form in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. If the secured notes are in certificated form, the Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar for the secured notes. The secured notes may be presented for registration or transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar. The Issuer may change any paying agent and registrar without notice to holders of the secured notes (the “Holders”). The Issuer will pay principal (and premium, if any) on the secured notes at the Trustee’s designated corporate office, as provided by the Trustee and updated from time to time in writing. If the secured notes are in certificated form, at the Issuer’s option, interest may be paid at the Trustee’s designated corporate trust office or by check mailed to the registered address of Holders. If the secured notes are in registered form, payment will be made via DTC. DTC requires payment by wire in immediately available funds.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Solely for purposes of disclosure under the Interest Act (Canada), whenever a rate of interest or fee under an unsecured note is calculated on the basis of a year (the “deemed year”) that contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest or fee by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year. Furthermore, if there is any obligations for Parent or any subsidiary formed under the laws of any jurisdiction of Canada to make any payment of interest or other amount payable in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by applicable law or would result in a receipt by any person of “interest” at a “criminal rate” (as such terms are defined under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by applicable law or so as to result in a receipt of “interest” at a “criminal rate” (as such terms are defined under the Criminal Code (Canada)).",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

On the Escrow Release Date, if the Acquisition is consummated, or on the issue date of the unsecured notes if the Acquisition occurs concurrently with the consummation of this offering, Parent and each of Parent’s other subsidiaries that is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the Secured Notes Indenture (the “Guarantors”) will, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee (the “Guarantees”), on a senior unsecured basis, all of the Issuer’s obligations under the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the unsecured notes and execute a supplemental indenture. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— Fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, and similar laws in applicable foreign jurisdictions, permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, any entity that is (a) a CFC, (b) a U.S. Person all or substantially all of the assets of which consist of the Equity Interests of one or more CFCs or (c) a U.S. Person that is a Subsidiary of a CFC, will not provide a Guarantee except in each case to the extent as agreed under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (each such entity not required to provide a Guarantee under clause (a), (b) or (c), an “Excluded CFC Entity”); provided, that none of Ironplanet Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., IAA International Holdings Limited and Synetiq Holdings Limited shall be considered an Excluded CFC Entity. Under this “Description of Unsecured Notes,” (x) a “CFC” means any controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is owned (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the Code) by either the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer that is a U.S. Person and a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (y) a “U.S. Person” means any United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code). 178 ----- Each Guarantor may amalgamate or consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to Parent, the Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation, or with other Persons, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Unsecured Notes Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets.” In the event all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor that is owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is sold and the sale complies with the provisions set forth in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor is properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the Guarantor’s Guarantee will be automatically released. Further, the Unsecured Notes Indenture will provide that a Guarantor’s Guarantee will be automatically released upon the earlier of (1) such Guarantor being released from, or discharged of, its guarantee of, and all pledges and security, if any, granted by such Guarantor in connection with, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes Indenture or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee (except, in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes Indenture, a release by or as a result of a payment thereon), and (2) Legal Defeasance with respect to the unsecured notes or satisfaction and discharge of the Unsecured Notes Indenture as described below under the sections titled “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge.” Not all of Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the unsecured notes.

In addition, the claims of the Holders are subject to the prior payment of all liabilities (whether or not for borrowed money) and to any preferred stock interest of such Subsidiaries other than the Guarantors. We cannot assure you that, from and after the Escrow Release Date, after providing for all prior claims, there would be sufficient assets available from Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors to satisfy the claims of the Holders of unsecured notes.

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Issuer must send a written notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall state, among other things, the purchase date, which (unless otherwise required by law) must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). Holders electing to have an unsecured note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the unsecured note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the unsecured note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. If the unsecured note is in global form, Holders will be required to follow applicable DTC procedures. If a Change of Control Offer is made, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control purchase price for all the unsecured notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. In the event the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding unsecured notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer may seek third party financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would be able to obtain such financing. 179 ----- Neither the Board of Directors of the Issuer nor the Trustee may waive the covenant relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer upon the circumstances described herein, and restrictions in the Unsecured Notes Indenture described herein on the ability of the Issuer, Parent and Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness, to grant liens on its property, to make Restricted Payments and to make Asset Sales may make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Issuer, whether favored or opposed by the management of the Issuer. Consummation of any such transaction in certain circumstances may require redemption or repurchase of the unsecured notes, and we cannot assure you that the Issuer or the acquiring party will have sufficient financial resources to effect such redemption or repurchase. Such restrictions and the restrictions on transactions with Affiliates may, in certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage any leveraged buyout of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries by the management of the Issuer. While such restrictions cover a wide variety of arrangements which have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions, the Unsecured Notes Indenture may not afford the Holders protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, amalgamation, merger or similar transaction. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of unsecured notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Change of Control” provisions of the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Change of Control” provisions of the Unsecured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Unsecured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all unsecured notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding unsecured notes has been given pursuant to the Unsecured Notes Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of Parent to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of unsecured notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the unsecured notes as described above.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred pursuant to and permitted under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent any Indebtedness would not be permitted to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness” or any of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as Permitted Indebtedness under clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness and permitted to be refinanced under clause (16) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect during the entire period of time after the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and, accordingly, all Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of such covenant. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates,” all Affiliate Transactions entered into by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with an Affiliate of Parent during the applicable Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into on or prior to the Issue Date, and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Guarantors,” all contracts entered into during the applicable Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date. For purposes of the “—Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Net Cash Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. Notwithstanding the fact that covenants suspended during a Suspension Period may be reinstated, (1) no Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to have occurred, and none of Parent, the Issuer or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with such covenants during the Suspension Period or at the time such covenants are reinstated and (2) following a Reversion Date, Parent, the Issuer and each of Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The Issuer shall give the Trustee written notice of any Suspension Event and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such Suspension Event has occurred. The Issuer shall give the Trustee written notice of any occurrence of a Reversion Date not later than five (5) Business Days after such Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Issuer and Parent will not, and will not permit any other Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness which by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) is expressly subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinate to the unsecured notes or the applicable Guarantee, as the case may be, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or such Guarantor, as the case may be. For purposes of the foregoing all other purposes under the Unsecured Notes Indenture, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor solely by virtue of such Indebtedness being unsecured or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Indebtedness have entered into one or more intercreditor agreements or similar arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral securing such Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The Unsecured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), or subject to the terms of, or incorporate any provision of, the TIA. Accordingly, the terms of the unsecured notes will include only those stated in the Unsecured Notes Indenture. Copies of the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Unsecured Notes Escrow Agreement may be obtained from the Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue $     million in aggregate principal amount of    % Senior Notes due 2031 (the “unsecured notes”) under an indenture (the “Unsecured Notes Indenture”) dated as of the Issue Date among Parent, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). From and after the Escrow Release Date, or on the issue date of the unsecured notes if the Acquisition occurs concurrently with the consummation of this offering: - the unsecured notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, equal in right of payment to all other senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer; - the unsecured notes and Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured debt of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, including Indebtedness under the secured notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities for so long as the secured notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured; - the unsecured notes and Guarantees will also be structurally subordinated to any debt, preferred stock obligations and other liabilities of Parent’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors; and - the unsecured notes and the Guarantees will be senior in right of payment to all future Indebtedness, if any, of Parent, the Issuer and the other Guarantors that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the unsecured notes and the Guarantees. We expect that, following consummation of the Acquisition, IAA and each of its subsidiaries that becomes a borrower or guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or a guarantor under the Secured Notes Indenture will also become a Guarantor of the unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2022, on a historical basis (without giving effect to the Transactions), (a) our existing subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors of the unsecured notes following the consummation of the Transactions had $72.7 million of liabilities (to which the unsecured notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $256.2 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances, and (b) IAA’s existing subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors of the unsecured notes following the consummation of the Transactions had $942.7 million of liabilities (to which the unsecured notes would have been structurally subordinated) and $1,721.9 million of assets, excluding intercompany balances. If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, prior to the Escrow Release Date, the unsecured notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, secured only by the Escrowed Property and senior unsecured obligations of Parent. 170 ----- The Issuer will issue the unsecured notes in fully registered form in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. If the unsecured notes are in certificated form, the Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar for the unsecured notes. The unsecured notes may be presented for registration or transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar. The Issuer may change any paying agent and registrar without notice to holders of the unsecured notes (the “Holders”). The Issuer will pay principal (and premium, if any) on the unsecured notes at the Trustee’s designated corporate office, as provided by the Trustee and updated from time to time in writing. If the unsecured notes are in certificated form, at the Issuer’s option, interest may be paid at the Trustee’s designated corporate trust office or by check mailed to the registered address of Holders. If the unsecured notes are in registered form, payment will be made via DTC. DTC requires payment by wire in immediately available funds.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to indirect participants such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through its Participants or Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of its Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: 229 ----- 1. upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and 2. ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indentures for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indentures, we and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor any agent of ours nor the trustee nor its agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for: 1. any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or 2. any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or us. Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. 230 ----- Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors,” transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Among other possibilities, the acquisition and/or holding of notes (or any interest in a note) by a Covered Plan with respect to which we, the initial purchasers, or the guarantors or any of our or their respective affiliates, agents or representatives (“Transaction Parties”) are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the DOL has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that potentially may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes by a Covered Plan. The class exemptions which the DOL has issued include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions or other violations of these rules, it is particularly important that any fiduciary of a Plan or other person who proposes to use assets of any Plan to invest in the notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, and any applicable Similar Laws, to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws.

This discussion does not apply to holders subject to special rules, including brokers, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-tomarket method of accounting for securities holdings, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, banks, thrifts and other financial institutions, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (and any investors thereof), persons that hold the notes as part of a hedging, integration, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, certain U.S. expatriates, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement, persons that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States to which the income from the notes is attributable, or persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a Non-U.S. Holder in light of their particular circumstances. Furthermore, it does not address any aspect of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate or gift tax laws or the 3.8% tax on certain net investment income, or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser as to the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and any other tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes. This discussion is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed Treasury regulations, published Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rulings and other administrative pronouncements and court decisions, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and any of which may be repealed, revoked or modified (possibly with retroactive effect) so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of the notes who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner, beneficiary, or other stakeholder will generally depend on the status of that person and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner, beneficiary, or other stakeholder in a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement holding the notes should consult its own tax adviser with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of its investment in the notes. _Interest on the Notes_ Interest on the notes will be treated as domestic source for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thus potentially subject to U.S. income and withholding tax. However, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on payments of interest on the notes provided that (1) such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if a tax treaty applies, such interest is not attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained within the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder) and (2) the Non-U.S. Holder (a) does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the issuer entitled to vote, (b) is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the issuer (within the meaning of the Code), and (c) certifies, under penalties of perjury, to the applicable withholding agent on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or appropriate substitute form) that it is not a U.S. person and that no withholding is required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) 235 ----- (discussed below), and provides its name, address and certain other required information or certain other certification requirements are satisfied. If interest on the notes is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a Non-U.S. Holder but such Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the other requirements outlined in the preceding paragraph, interest on the notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax (currently imposed at a 30% rate), unless the withholding tax rate is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty, and such Non-U.S. Holder is a qualified resident of the treaty country and complies with certain certification requirements. The certifications described in this section “Interest on the Notes” and the below section “Interest or Gain Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business in the United States” must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may be entitled to obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty. _Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_ Except with respect to accrued but unpaid interest, which generally will be taxed as described above under “—Interest on the Notes,” or below under “—Interest or Gain Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business in the United States,” a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax (or any withholding thereof) with respect to gain, if any, recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes unless (1) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base of the NonU.S. Holder within the United States, or (2) in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is an individual, such holder is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year in which the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied. An individual Non-U.S. Holder who is subject to U.S. federal income tax because the Non-U.S. Holder was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived from such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses, provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. _Interest or Gain Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business in the United States_ Interest on a note or gain from a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if a tax treaty applies, such interest is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base within the United States) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis (but not U.S. withholding tax), in the same manner as if the NonU.S. Holder were a U.S. person, and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax (currently imposed at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. In order to avoid U.S. federal withholding tax on interest on the notes, the Non-U.S. Holder should deliver to the applicable withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax. _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_ Under FATCA, withholding (currently at a rate of 30%) generally will be required in certain circumstances on interest payable on, or (subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below) gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, the notes held by or through certain “foreign financial institutions” (within the meaning of the Code) (including investment funds), unless such institution (i) enters into, and complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons or by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments, or (ii) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States 236 ----- and an applicable foreign country, reports such information to its local tax authority, which will exchange such information with the U.S. authorities. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Accordingly, the entity through which the notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, interest payable on, or (subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below) gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, the notes held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” (within the meaning of the Code) or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” (within the meaning of the Code) which will in turn be provided to the United States Department of the Treasury. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest on a note. Although withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a note, proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on an investment in the notes. 237 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Restructuring Directive”) entered into force. Member States were required to pass national laws to implement the directive by July 17, 2021, at the latest, however not all Member States have done so. The E.U. Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the E.U. Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The E.U. Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the E.U. Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the E.U. Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. In particular, when implementing the E.U. Restructuring Directive, Member States must ensure that, under their national laws, companies will have access to a pre-insolvency restructuring framework which permits a haircut of debt and other restructuring measures on the basis of a majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers (meaning, for instance, that an opposing creditor can be outvoted by the majority). The E.U. Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cramdown, i.e., even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the E.U. Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which is implemented via national legislation. The on-going implementation of the E.U. Restructuring Directive into Member State national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. Although the E.U. Restructuring Directive also foresees a number of safeguards protecting creditors from abuse and although it is not clear how exactly the E.U. Restructuring Directive will be implemented in individual Member States, the current domestic insolvency law of some Member States may change – or have already changed – substantially if they lack any of the mechanisms that the E.U. Restructuring 244 ----- Directive will make mandatory. This might have considerable repercussions for the position of creditors of a Member State legal entity. The description of the current Member State domestic insolvency regimes must, therefore, be read with the understanding that they may still change substantially.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.1,European Union,326.1.2,,"Several of the guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the European Union. Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”) is situated shall have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. There is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, that the centre of main interests of a company or legal person is to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, with these proceedings governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local laws of the court opening such main insolvency proceeding. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. The effects of those main proceedings, however, do not affect third party rights in rem situated in a territory of another Member State in accordance with Article 10 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulations. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” (secondary proceedings) only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of and as defined in Article 2(10) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non transitory economic activity with human means and assets. 243 ----- The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s “centre of main interests” is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The E.U. Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

The procedural and substantive provisions of Australian insolvency laws afford debtors and unsecured creditors only limited protection from the claims of secured creditors. There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: administration (sometimes referred to as voluntary administration); deed of company arrangement; receivership; and liquidation (also referred to as winding up). There is also a fifth less common regime, which is a creditor’s scheme of arrangement. A brief description of each is set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Alternatively, if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence, the object of the administration is to achieve a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company. In the vast majority of cases, a company is put into administration by resolution of its board of directors if the board of directors resolves that the company is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at some future time. In some cases an administrator may be appointed by a secured creditor who is entitled to enforce its security over the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property. However, a secured creditor will usually prefer to appoint a receiver (pursuant to a contractual right in its security) who, unlike an administrator, will primarily act in the interests of the secured creditor to realize the secured property (even though a receiver also owes various duties to the company in its capacity as agent and an officer of the company). A secured creditor with a security interest over the whole or 245 ----- substantially the whole of the company’s property has a limited period following the appointment of an administrator in which to appoint a receiver, should it wish to do so. Administration is only intended to last for a short period, during which time the administrator controls the company and acts as its agent. The powers of the directors and officers are suspended, though they remain in office and have a duty to assist the administrator. The administrator’s role is to assess the company’s situation and to report to creditors on the three available options (liquidation, execution of a deed of company arrangement or to return the company to the control of its directors) and report to creditors as to which option should be followed. To permit the administrator the opportunity to do this, during the administration there is a moratorium on the enforcement of certain types of creditors’ claims and actions against the company and its property (subject to certain exceptions) and a stay on legal proceedings that will prevent, among other things, security being enforced (subject to certain exceptions, including the right of a secured creditor to appoint a receiver in certain circumstances, as referred to above).",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

By force of the Corporations Act, the agreement is one which will bind unsecured creditors whose debts are provable whether or not those creditors vote in favor of it, provided that a simple majority (in number, unless a poll is conducted, in which case it is by number and value) votes in favor of the deed of company arrangement. The Corporations Act is relatively flexible on the contents of the deed of company arrangement. Once the deed of company arrangement is executed, the administration terminates and the moratorium restrictions come to an end and are replaced by the provisions of the deed, which may include similar moratorium protections in respect of creditor claims. The deed administrator may be tasked by the deed with realizing assets, closing down the business, restructuring the company or pursuing litigation with a view to the payment of dividends to creditors. The deed may apply a moratorium, compromise creditors’ claims, provide for the payment of creditors by installment or specify that different creditors are to receive different treatment, provided that the deed is not unfairly prejudicial to a creditor or creditors as a whole. This is usually assessed by comparing the return that a creditor is entitled to receive under the deed with the return that the creditor could expect to receive if the company was liquidated. Secured creditors may continue to deal with the property over which they have security and are not bound by the deed, unless the secured creditor voted in favor of the deed (and the deed restricts its ability to enforce its security) or it is prevented from enforcing by a court order. In the event that a guarantor enters into a deed of company arrangement, creditors may lose various rights in respect of the guarantor, including their right to bring a claim against the guarantor. They may be left with a right to prove any claim against a fund established under a deed of company arrangement, which may not be sufficient to satisfy the guarantee.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Whilst a receiver is appointed as agent of the company for liability purposes, the receiver’s primary responsibility is to act in the best interests of its appointee. A receiver’s appointment and powers are generally governed by the terms of the security agreement under which it is appointed. The receiver’s principal task is to take possession and control of the secured property, realize the property subject to the security and pay the proceeds to the security holder. Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the receiver. In contrast, both administration and liquidation are regimes aimed at securing the best outcome for all of the company’s creditors and members as a whole. As an officer of the company, a receiver owes certain duties to the company, unsecured creditors and shareholders. Where a company grants security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must generally be remitted to the holder of the security, unless there are claims ranking in priority to the holder of the security, as summarized below: 246 ----- (1) if the proceeds are from contracts of insurance and the insurance policy is in respect of liability to third parties, the proceeds must be paid to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred; (2) auditor’s fees and expenses for the period between when the Australia Securities Investments Commission has refused consent to the auditor’s resignation and the date the receiver was appointed; (3) wages, superannuation contributions and superannuation guarantee charges payable by the company in respect of services rendered to the company by the employees prior to the date the receiver was appointed; (4) all amounts due on or before the date the receiver is appointed in respect of leave of absence owing to employees; (5) retrenchment payments; and (6) all amounts that have been advanced by other parties to the company for the purpose of paying wages, superannuation contributions or payments in respect of leave of absence or termination of employment.

The distribution of proceeds will be subject to statutory priority rules. The company’s existence will then be brought to an end by deregistration. Generally speaking, to the extent that their security is sufficient, secured creditors stand outside the liquidation and therefore do not have to prove their debts. Secured creditors also have the right to appoint a receiver and manager and enforce against the secured property during the liquidation. Secured creditors are generally entitled to sell the assets subject to their security or have them sold and to receive the proceeds (subject to the rights of any prior security holders).",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Schemes of arrangement are rarely used in an insolvency context, as they require an extended court approval process and the approval of 75% in value and 50% in number of each class of affected creditor. A scheme of arrangement is most commonly used where a company is seeking to restructure all or some of its term debt rather than to compromise the claims of creditors generally. Voidable transactions Under Australian law, if an order to wind-up were to be made against the Australian Guarantors and a liquidator was appointed, the liquidator would have the power to investigate the validity of past transactions and may seek various court orders, including orders to void certain transactions entered into prior to the winding-up of the Australian Guarantors and for the repayment of money. These include transactions entered into within a specified period of the winding-up that a court considers uncommercial transactions or transactions entered into when winding-up is imminent that have the effect of preferring a creditor or creditors or otherwise defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors. In Australia, under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), a guarantee (or payment under a guarantee) may be set aside (subject to certain defences) if the guarantor is being wound up and the guarantee (or payment) is found by a court, on the application of the company’s liquidator, to be an “insolvent transaction.” A transaction of a company is an insolvent transaction if it is: (a) an “unfair preference” (as defined below) given by the company to a creditor of the company, or 247 ----- (b) an “uncommercial transaction” (as defined below) of the company, and the company was insolvent at the time or became insolvent because of the transaction (or an act or omission made for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction). An unfair preference is given by a company to a creditor if a transaction to which the company and the creditor are parties results in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt that the company owes to the creditor, more than the creditor would otherwise receive from the company if it were to prove for the debt in a winding up. Uncommercial transactions are those which a reasonable person in the company’s circumstances would not have entered into having regard to any relevant matter including: (a) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; (b) the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; and (c) the respective benefits to other parties of entering into the transaction. A liquidator is empowered to challenge any insolvent transaction if it was entered into, or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it, by the company in the six months ending on the “relation back day” (which will usually be the date on which any application to the court to wind-up the company was made or where immediately before the winding up order was made the company was under administration, the date of commencement of the administration). Any insolvent transaction which is also an uncommercial transaction of the company may be challenged if it was entered into, or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it, by the company in the two years ending on the relation back day. Where a related entity of the company is a party to the insolvent transaction, the period of challenge is four years ending on the relation back day. If the transaction were entered into for a purpose including the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of any or all of the creditors of the company on a winding up, the period of challenge is ten years. Where a company was under administration or subject to a deed of company arrangement immediately before the company resolved, or a court ordered, that the company be wound up, an uncommercial transaction or an unfair preference may be challenged by a liquidator if the transaction was entered into, or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it, by the company during the period from the relation back day and ending when the company made the resolution, or when the court made the order, that the company be wound up, and the transaction, or the act done for the purpose of giving effect to it, was not entered into, or done on behalf of, the company by, or under the authority of, the administrator of the company or the administrator of the deed of company arrangement (as applicable).",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The issue is particularly relevant where a company provides a guarantee in relation to the obligations of another member of its corporate family, as is the case for the guarantees given by the Australian Guarantors with respect to the notes offered hereby. In determining whether there is sufficient benefit, the directors need to give primary consideration to the benefits and detriments to the guarantor in giving the guarantee, in addition to the benefits to the other members of the corporate family. Whether a guarantee entered into in breach of directors’ duties can be avoided against a party relying on the guarantee depends on certain factors, including whether the party knew of or suspected the breach.

1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.4,Canada,326.4.1,Insolvency Proceedings,"Formal insolvency proceedings in Canada may be initiated in a number of ways, generally pursuant to the federal Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”)_ (applicable to a company or affiliated companies having debts in excess of C$5,000,000) or the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) (applicable to all companies). Insolvency proceedings generally include a stay preventing creditors from taking direct enforcement action without leave of the supervising court. Claims of creditors are generally addressed within the proceeding. Proceedings under the CCAA are commenced before a superior court, usually by a debtor company or creditor, and can be used to effect a sale of the debtor company/companies, its assets, and/or to propose a plan of compromise and arrangement (a “Plan”) with creditors. Under a Plan, creditors with substantially similar interests are organized into classes and must vote on the Plan. If passed by the requisite threshold of creditors in each class, being a majority in 248 ----- number representing 2/3 of value of the creditor claims voting in that class, and approved by the supervising court, the Plan is binding on all affected creditors. Accordingly, creditors of the Canadian guarantors may have their claims compromised by a Plan without their consent. Where an asset sale is effected through a CCAA proceeding, court approval is required, but a creditor vote is not. The court also has the authority to grant reverse vesting orders, which facilitate the conveyance of the equity interest of a debtor company to a purchasing entity free and clear of unwanted liens and encumbrances, and the assignment of unwanted liabilities and assets to a residual company or trust. Reverse vesting orders, like an asset sale, do not require a vote by creditors. In addition, the CCAA grants broad jurisdiction for the supervising court to grant a variety of unique remedies depending on the circumstances, and it is not possible to predict what relief the court may grant and effect on the creditors of the Canadian guarantors. A CCAA court has broad discretion to grant charges having a priority over all other creditors, including charges securing the fees and disbursements of professionals, interim financing, and the indemnification of directors and officers. In such a circumstance, the court must consider a number of factors, including whether any creditor affected by the proposed charges may be materially prejudiced. The court may provide protections in the face of material prejudice. However, this power is discretionary, and we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, holders of the notes offered hereby would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value. Proceedings under the BIA include a proposal to creditors, receivership or a bankruptcy. A proposal proceeding is similar to the CCAA, though the provisions of the BIA are generally more restrictive. While much of the relief available in a BIA proposal requires court approval, commencing a proposal proceeding (and thereby effecting a stay of proceedings) and presenting a proposal to creditors does not require court approval and can be done relatively quickly. In addition, distributions to creditors in a proposal are subject to a levy payable to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, a government official. In the event that the debtor’s proposal to its creditors is either rejected by any class of unsecured creditors at a meeting held to approve such proposal (with the same voting thresholds as the CCAA noted above) or by the court when the proposal is put before the court for approval, the debtor is deemed bankrupt. Notably, if a proposal is rejected by a class of secured creditors but accepted by each class of unsecured creditors, the proposal does not automatically fail. The secured class rejecting the proposal is left to pursue rights and remedies in respect of their security, while the proposal is submitted to the court for approval. A bankruptcy under the BIA is a liquidation proceeding whereby a licensed insolvency trustee is appointed and all assets of the debtor company vest in the trustee, subject to the claims of secured creditors. The trustee then administers a claims process to determine the unsecured creditors of the bankrupt company, and distributes assets in accordance with the priority regime set out in the BIA (after the payment of secured creditors). Distributions in a bankruptcy are subject to a levy payable to the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, a government official. A receiver and/or receiver-manager (collectively a “Receiver”) appointed under the BIA takes control of some or all of the assets of a company under the supervision of a supervising superior court. The application to appoint a Receiver is brought by a secured creditor. The court is granted broad discretion to empower the Receiver, and it is not possible to innumerate all the powers a Receiver may be vested with. Generally it includes the power to operate the debtor’s business if desirable, and to sell the business either as a going concern or piece-meal. The order appointing a Receiver generally includes a stay of proceedings, and may grant the Receiver a priority charge for its fees, disbursements and borrowings in priority to all other creditors, including secured creditors. In such a circumstance, the court must consider a number of factors, including whether any creditor affected by the proposed order may be materially prejudiced. The court may provide protections in the face of material prejudice. However, this power is discretionary, and we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, holders of the notes offered hereby would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value. It is also possible for secured creditors to appoint a Receiver pursuant to the provisions of their security documents. While these Receivers are not generally supervised by a court and there is not a stay of proceedings, they often have the ability pursuant to the security document and relevant statutory regimes governing priority to sell the debtors assets free and clear of the claims of secured creditors subordinate to the appointing creditor and unsecured creditors. Various federal and provincial corporate statutes provide the ability of companies to propose a plan of arrangement to their creditors and/or shareholders. The provisions of these statutes vary by jurisdiction, but generally allow for the compromise and restructuring of debts if approved by the requisite majority of creditors and under the supervision of the court. They also generally permit a stay of proceedings. 249 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

In addition, both the BIA and CCAA contain certain priority charges. The effect and priority of claims can also be affected by bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. Generally, creditors having security over a particular asset of the debtor company are entitled to be paid in priority to unsecured creditors. The validity of the security and the priority as between creditors is governed by the applicable statute providing the security. Subject to certain preferred claims set out in the BIA, unsecured creditors generally share the distributions available to unsecured creditors pari passu. In addition, certain other statutes, including those relating to taxation, pensions, and environmental matters, may provide for priority charges in favour of the federal or provincial governments for various obligations. These charges can have priority over secured and/or unsecured creditors in relation to certain assets, or the assets of a debtor company generally.

The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law (collectively, the “Recognition Provisions”). The Recognition Provisions allow an authorized representative to apply for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding as either a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding.” The determination of the type of proceeding is based upon the centre of main interest (“COMI”) of the debtor. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign main proceeding”, the court must grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and must prohibit the debtor from selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property in Canada outside the ordinary course of its business, and may grant additional relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA, including the recognition of relief granted in the foreign jurisdiction which may differ from the relief normally available in Canada. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign non-main” proceeding, the court may, but is not required to, grant a stay of proceedings in Canada, prohibit the debtor from selling any of its property in Canada outside the ordinary course of business, and grant any other relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA, including the recognition of relief granted in the foreign jurisdiction which may differ from the relief normally available in Canada. However, if a proceeding has already been commenced under the CCAA/BIA in relation to the same company, any recognition order must be consistent with the orders already granted in the CCAA/BIA proceeding. In the event that the foreign proceeding results in the approval of a restructuring plan, the Canadian court may grant an order providing that such plan and/or an order approving such plan shall be recognized and have full force and effect in Canada. Under the Recognition Provisions a court may issue an order on any terms and conditions that the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.

These reviews can occur if a bankruptcy, insolvency or arrangement proceeding is commenced, or a lawsuit pursuant to fraudulent conveyance, assignment and preference laws is commenced by or in respect of the Canadian guarantors. Under these laws, a court can void the obligations under the relevant guarantee or subordinate the guarantee to the Canadian guarantor’s other debt, if, among other things, the Canadian guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee: 250 ----- - issued the guarantee with the intention to delay, hinder, defeat or defraud creditors or others, noting however that if such occurs in the context of a related party transaction, the intention may be, in certain circumstances, by statute, presumed or not be a necessary element; - received no consideration, or consideration of less than fair market value for issuing the guarantee at the time it issued the guarantee; - was insolvent at the time of issuing the guarantee or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee, noting that under some provincial and territorial fraudulent conveyance and assignment laws, insolvency may not be a necessary element; - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or for other fraudulent reasons; or - had the effect of giving the beneficiaries of the guarantee a preference over another creditor, and under federal bankruptcy and insolvency legislation and in the case of arm’s length parties, the debtor’s intention to prefer is not rebutted. The test of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer and preference laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent or preference transfer has occurred. Under the BIA, a Canadian guarantor would be considered an insolvent person if: - it is unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due; - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due; or - the aggregate of its property is not, at fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing due. The guarantee could also be subject to the claim that the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the relevant Canadian guarantor and that, as a result, the obligations of the relevant Canadian guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. If a Canadian court were to find that the guarantee was a transfer at undervalue, preference, fraudulent conveyance or other similar voidable transaction, the Canadian court could, among other things, have the guarantee set aside or voided. In the event of such a finding, holders of the notes offered hereby may not receive any repayment on the notes.

Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). Re 1: A moratorium of payments can be granted only at the request of the debtor. Upon such request, the court will generally grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) who, jointly with the company’s management, will be in charge of the company and its business undertakings. A definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless there is an objection by creditors admitted to a vote of creditors which jointly represent either (i) at least one-fourth of the total amount of unsecured claims or (ii) at least one-third of all unsecured creditors. In a moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered by the debtor to its creditors. Such a composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favor or against it or whether they were represented at the creditor’s meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if: (i) it is approved by more than 50% in number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the creditor’s meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and non-preferential claims admitted for voting purposes; and (ii) it is subsequently ratified by the court. Consequently, Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings could reduce the recovery of note holders. Re 2: A debtor can be declared bankrupt by the competent Dutch court either at its own request or at the request of a creditor. When a company is declared bankrupt, the court will appoint a liquidator in bankruptcy proceedings (curator) whose primary task is to liquidate the assets of the company and to distribute the proceeds to the company’s creditors on the basis of the relative priority of their respective claims and, to the extent claims of certain creditors have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. The bankrupt debtor may offer a composition (akkoord) to the unsecured and non-preferential creditors. Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, if: (i) it is approved by a simple majority of a meeting of the recognized and admitted unsecured and non-preferential creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and admitted unsecured and non-preferential claims; and (ii) it is subsequently ratified by the court. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy proceedings could reduce the recovery of holders of the notes offered hereby. Re 1/2: A composition offered in a moratorium of payments or in bankruptcy proceedings is not binding on preferential and secured creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, such as fraudulent conveyance (Actio Pauliana), holders of Dutch law security rights may generally enforce their rights in respect of the security separately from bankruptcy or moratorium of payments. In that respect a Dutch moratorium or bankruptcy differs from, e.g., Chapter 11 reorganizations in the United States. During bankruptcy or a moratorium of payments, enforcement by the holder of a security right may be suspended by the court, in each case for a maximum period of four months. A holder of security may be prevented from enforcing its security if such enforcement would be contrary to principles of reasonableness and fairness in the circumstances at hand. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated different from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the Netherlands. Bankruptcy related proceedings in the Netherlands may be time consuming and subject to significant delays and incidental litigation. 252 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The CERP provides for a proceeding to restructure debts of companies in financial distress outside insolvency proceedings (the “Dutch Scheme”). The CERP provides that a debtor or a (on the request of a party authorized to do so under the CERP) court-appointed restructuring expert may offer creditors (including secured creditors) and shareholders a composition plan. Upon confirmation by the court, such plan is binding on the creditors and shareholders to which it has been offered and changes their rights. A composition plan under the CERP can also extend to claims against group companies of the debtor on the account of guarantees for the debtor’s obligations, if inter alia (i) the relevant group companies are reasonably expected to be unable to continue to pay their debts as they fall due and (ii) the Dutch courts would have jurisdiction if the relevant group company would offer its creditors and shareholders a composition plan under the CERP. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the CERP may extend to entities incorporated or residing outside the Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the jurisdiction of the Netherlands. Under the CERP, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two-third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The CERP provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross-class cram down). Under the CERP, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the CERP, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter alia: (a) all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge; (b) the debtor can continue to exercise any authority it had prior to the commencement of the cooling-down period to use, consume and dispose of assets (included secured assets) and to collect pledged claims, in each case in the ordinary course of business and subject to the requirement that the interests of parties affected thereby are sufficiently protected; and (c) filings for bankruptcy or moratorium of payments of the debtor are suspended. Under the CERP, claims of creditors against the Dutch guarantors can be compromised as a result of a composition plan adopted and confirmed in accordance with the CERP. A composition plan under the CERP can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the CERP can affect the rights of the trustee and/or the holders of the notes under the indentures governing the notes and therefore the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The objects of a Dutch legal entity are set out in its articles of association. To provide maximum comfort that granting guarantees and security do not exceed the entity’s objects, it is recommended that the articles of association expressly 253 ----- provide (and, where necessary, be amended to provide) that the entity may grant guarantees and security in respect of another (legal) person’s obligations. However, there is case law to the effect that the scope of an entity’s objects cannot be determined solely on the basis of its articles of association, but that all circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, guarantees or security which are expressly permitted by the articles of association may nonetheless exceed an entity’s objects if it is detrimental to the entity’s corporate interests. What an entity’s corporate interests require, will depend on the circumstances. Case law suggests that in relation to granting guarantees and security in respect of the debts of a target company of the entity concerned, two questions may be particularly relevant: (a) when determining whether granting a guarantee or creating security violates the entity’s objects, the entity’s interests in the guarantee or security is to be taken into account, but weight may also be put to the interests of the group of which the entity is a member. How much weight may be put to the interests of the group, is influenced by the degree of interrelatedness between the group members: the more the group is interwoven, the more weight may be put to the interest of the group. (b) the mere fact that an entity grants a guarantee or creates security for debts which exceed its financial capacity, does not necessarily imply that the guarantee or security violates its objects. Weight is to be put to the benefit which the entity may enjoy as a result of the guarantee or security. The relevant benefits may be direct, but also may be indirect and may include specific or general benefits which the entity enjoys as a result of it being a member of the relevant group. If there are such benefits, the guarantee or security will generally be valid, unless it is foreseeable that the guarantee or security will put the continued existence of the entity at risk or the guarantee or security disproportionally prejudices the entity in any other way.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

An administrator can also be appointed (subject to specific conditions) out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (i) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary objective); (ii) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the second objective); or (iii) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the third objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. During the administration, in general, creditors cannot exercise their rights against the company, including, among other things, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of court or the consent of the administrator. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral agreement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court. In limited circumstances a secured creditor will be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver and any already appointed must vacate office on the making of an administration order against the company in administration. If the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. A receiver (including an administrative receiver) does not have duties to the general body of creditors in the same way as an administrator and will act solely to realize the assets over which his appointor has security, for the benefit of such appointor. If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) in certain circumstances. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must 255 ----- resign if required to do so by administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
1509_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.6,England and Wales,326.6.2,Liquidation,"Liquidation is a winding up procedure under which the assets of the company are realised and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act 1986 (being the act of parliament which governs insolvency proceedings in the UK, and hereafter the “UK Insolvency Act”). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company; to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up; to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions. There are three ways that an English Guarantor may be placed into liquidation or be “wound up”; these are: (i) members’ voluntary liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only); (ii) creditors’ voluntary liquidation; and (iii) compulsory winding-up (a courtbased procedure). At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. In the case of a liquidation commenced by way of a court order, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected). There is no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding up—it is for the liquidator to apply to the court for a stay should he require a moratorium. In addition to the various potential challenges to the guarantee that are outlined below, under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Under the UK Insolvency Act and Insolvency (England & Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined and described below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): _First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific_ assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor, but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest; _Second ranking claims: moratorium and certain categories of pre-moratorium debts (known as “priority pre-_ moratorium debts”) if a company goes into administration or proceedings for the winding-up of the company are commenced within the period of 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium (as to which see below); _Third ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_ priority in which expenses are paid); 256 ----- _Fourth ranking claims: first, ordinary preferential debts, being contributions to occupational pension schemes,_ employment claims (wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit; and secondly, secondary preferential debts, being bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory limit, deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation and claims by HMRC for certain amounts of tax held by the company on behalf of employees or customers, including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions; _Fifth ranking claims: holders of any floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._ However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; _Sixth ranking claims: (i) provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent of any_ unsecured shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them); (ii) statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at either the contractual or a statutory rate; and (iii) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. To pay a shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; and _Seventh ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_ funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of any floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). For floating charges created after 6 April 2020, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the relevant company’s net property and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000.

In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the guarantee was granted or “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A company will be “unable to pay its debts” if a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the company and remains 257 ----- unpaid for three weeks or the company has failed to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant creditor within such period or if, in England and Wales, an execution on or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that (a) the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or (b) that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). If the guarantee granted by an English Guarantor is challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as described further below), it may be permitted to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of such English Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee provided by such English Guarantor; - direct that the holders of the notes return any amounts paid by or realised from such English Guarantor under a guarantee to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such English Guarantor’s creditors; and/or - take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the notes. The Issuer and the guarantors cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English Guarantor’s insolvency (as described further below) is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a guarantee in respect of the notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (i) the court application for an administration order is issued, or (ii) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (iii) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If the given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out more particularly below). A “connected person” of a company granting a guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences includes (among others): - a party who is (i) a director of the company; (ii) a shadow director; (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (iv) an associate of the relevant company; - a party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual; (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; - a party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company; and - a company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same person by 258 ----- treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

The grant of a guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act). In addition the company must be “unable to pay its debts” when it grants the guarantee or become “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any guarantee although there is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts in such proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The grant of a guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person). A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the guarantee). There is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and the company does not need to be in insolvency proceedings for such an action to be commenced nor does the relevant company need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction.

In practice, any foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, amongst other things, the company’s “centre of main interests” is in England, or the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. The law in this area is being closely considered by the English courts and the fact that the second limb has been found to be satisfied in such cases previously does not necessarily mean that this will be satisfied in all such cases as each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable.

A company can propose a restructuring plan to its creditors (and/or its shareholders). Creditors will be divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation of the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of restructuring plan meetings. Each class will then vote on whether they accept the plan and provided that sufficient creditors approve the plan and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to sanction the plan, then the plan will be binding on all creditors regardless of whether they, individually or as a class, approved the plan. The restructuring plan will be available not just to companies incorporated in the UK but to any company with a sufficient connection to the UK. There are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan: (a) the company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (b) a compromise or arrangement must be proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) and the purpose of such compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of the financial difficulties the company is facing. Before the court considers the sanction of a restructuring plan, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors whose rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the meeting and vote on the plan but there is no need to include creditors whose rights are not affected. Furthermore, a court may exclude even a creditor whose rights are affected where it is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company. In respect of a consensual restructuring plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favor) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors present and voting (in person or by proxy) in each class must agree the compromise or arrangement. In respect of a “cram-down” restructuring plan (i.e. a restructuring plan where there is a dissenting class of creditors), the court may still sanction a plan, provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (referred to below); and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors, present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. The relevant alternative is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned by the court. 261 ----- The restructuring plan must then be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan.

The moratorium will be overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a monitor although the directors will remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis. Certain types of financial services companies are ineligible for the moratorium, including parties to capital market arrangements. The effect of the moratorium will be to provide the company with a “payment holiday” in respect of its “premoratorium debts”. In other words, the company will not be obliged to pay those debts during the moratorium. A “premoratorium debt” is any debt or other liability of the company that has fallen due prior to the commencement of the moratorium or which becomes due during the moratorium but under an obligation incurred by the company prior to the commencement of the moratorium. A “moratorium debt” is any debt or other liability that the company becomes subject to during the moratorium (other than by reason of an obligation entered into prior to the moratorium) or to which the company may become subject after the end of the moratorium because of an obligation incurred during the moratorium. Moratorium debts and certain categories of pre-moratorium debts attract super-priority in a subsequent liquidation or administration of the company that commences within 12 weeks of the end of the moratorium. 262 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Any insolvency proceeding by or against an English Guarantor are likely to, but may not necessarily, be based on English insolvency laws as each English Guarantor is incorporated in England, maintains its registered office and conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis in England and Wales. The U.K. Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provides, however, that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its “centre of its main interests” in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced in respect of an English Guarantor or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other including in the areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, the priority 254 ----- of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdictions’ laws should apply or would adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantee in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings with respect to an English Guarantor. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company, its directors or a creditor making an application for administration, in or out of court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent either on a “cash flow” or “balance sheet” basis. A company is cash flow insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. A company is balance sheet insolvent if the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Under the Bankruptcy Act of Japan (Act No. 75 of 2004, as amended), a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or any of its directors or creditors if a company is generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due because of a lack of ability to pay or if its liabilities exceed its assets. Under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan (Act No. 154 of 2002, as amended), a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or certain qualified shareholders or creditors if it is likely that any of the grounds for bankruptcy as described above will arise. In addition, a company may file a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings if it is likely that the payment of a debt which becomes due would cause serious impediments to its continued business operations. Under the Civil Rehabilitation Act of Japan (Act No. 225 of 1999, as amended), a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings may be filed with a court by a company or any of its creditors if it is likely that any of the grounds for bankruptcy as described above will arise. A petition for civil rehabilitation may be also filed by a company if the company is unable to make any payments as they become due without causing any material obstruction to the continuation of its business. Under the Companies Act of Japan (Act No. 86 of 2005, as amended, “Companies Act of Japan”), a petition for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings may be filed with a court by any of a company’s creditors, liquidators, statutory auditors or shareholders if, after liquidation proceedings have commenced, circumstances exist which would seriously impede the carrying out of its liquidation or if there exists any possibility or doubt that its liabilities exceed its assets. The court will be required to order the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings at its initiative if, after a special liquidation has been commenced, the court determines that there exists a fact which constitutes a cause of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings while: (i) there is no prospect of entering into a settlement agreement; (ii) there is no prospect of performing a settlement agreement; or (iii) the special liquidation conflicts with the general interest of the creditors. In any of the insolvency proceedings mentioned above, the company’s liabilities under the guarantee would, in general, be paid to holders of the guarantee and creditors ranking equally with such holders in right of payment on a pro rata basis, only after all of its debts that are entitled to a preferred status (yuusen ken) under the insolvency laws (such as employment remuneration claims, expenses of insolvency proceedings and taxes) have been paid. Also, the rights of the holders of the guarantee will be effectively subordinated to those of secured creditors (tanpo-kensha). In solvency proceedings other than corporate reorganization proceedings, secured creditors will be entitled to exercise their rights over the guarantor’s assets outside of the insolvency proceedings, although the exercise of such rights by the secured creditors may be suspended upon a special order of the court in civil rehabilitation proceedings. Moreover, in corporate reorganization proceedings, secured creditors will be required to participate in such proceedings, and their rights could be impaired or modified in accordance with a reorganization plan. However, claims of general creditors, including holders of the guarantee, would be subordinated under the plan to secured claims to the extent of the net value of the security interest at the commencement of the proceedings. Under Japanese insolvency laws, no party (including, without limitation, any director of a company) is expressly obligated to file for the commencement of insolvency proceedings in any particular circumstance (except that liquidators are required to file for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings or the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings in certain circumstances). However, a company’s directors are subject to general fiduciary duties (zenryouna kanrisha no chuuigimu) under the Companies Act of Japan, which may in certain circumstances require them to take appropriate steps, including filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings when a cause for insolvency arises. If a company’s directors do not take appropriate action in such circumstances, they could be subject to civil liabilities. 263 ----- If, based on a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such bankruptcy proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy (hasan kanzainin) will be appointed to administer the company’s operations, realize all assets belonging to the bankruptcy estate and make distributions to creditors. If, based on a petition for the commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such reorganization proceedings, a reorganization administrator (kousei kanzainin) will be appointed to take over the company’s operations, assess all assets and liabilities, propose a reorganization plan and, if the plan is approved by a company’s creditors and confirmed by the court, transfer management responsibilities to the new management under the plan. If, based on a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such rehabilitation proceedings, a company’s directors will remain in position (subject to supervision by a court appointed rehabilitation supervisor (kantoku iin)) to propose a rehabilitation plan and, if approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, execute the plan. If, based on a petition for the commencement of special liquidation proceedings, a court orders the commencement of such special liquidation proceedings, a liquidator (seisan-nin) will, under court supervision, liquidate all remaining assets and liabilities and make distributions to creditors under a settlement agreement approved by its creditors and confirmed by the court. The issuance of the guarantee and payments made to the holders of the guarantee may be avoided in insolvency proceedings (except for special liquidation proceedings) by the bankruptcy trustee, reorganization administrator or rehabilitation supervisor pursuant to their “right of avoidance” (hi-nin ken) as a fraudulent conveyance or voidable preference. The acts that are subject to this right of avoidance (hi-nin ken) include: - any act (except the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations) by the debtor taken with the knowledge that such act will prejudice creditors and the beneficiary of such act was aware, at the time of the act, of the fact that such act will prejudice creditors; - any act (except the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations) by the debtor that prejudices creditors and occurs after the debtor has suspended payments or after the filing of a petition, and the beneficiary of such act was aware, at the time of the act, that the debtor has suspended payments or the filing of a petition has been made, and of the fact that such act will prejudice creditors; - any act that relates to the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations as to the already existing obligations and that; - (i) occurs after the debtor has become unable to pay debts in general and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of such debtor’s inability or suspension of payments by the debtor or (ii) occurs after the filing of a petition and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of such filing; or - is not within the scope of the debtor’s obligation or the time of the payment is not such that is required as the debtor’s obligation, and occurs within 30 days prior to the debtor becoming unable to pay debts in general and the creditor was aware, at the time of the act, of the fact that such act will prejudice other creditors; and - any gratuitous act (or act deemed to be gratuitous) by the debtor after, or within six months prior to, either the suspension of payments by the debtor or the filing of a petition. For example, the issuance of or payment on the guarantee may be avoided if: (i) with respect to the issuance, a company is deemed to have been aware at the time of the issuance that it would be to the detriment of its creditors and the holders of the guarantee are deemed to have had notice of such fact at that time; (ii) the payment takes place after it have become unable to pay its debts in general, or a petition for insolvency proceedings has been filed, and the holders of the guarantee are deemed to have been aware of such fact at that time; or (iii) where the payment is not within the scope of the debtor’s obligation or the time of the payment is not such that is required as the debtor’s obligation, and the payment takes place within 30 days prior to the debtor becoming unable to pay debts in general and the holders of the guarantee were aware, at the time of the payment, of the fact that such payment will prejudice other creditors. Creditors may also demand the court to rescind act taken by the debtor pursuant to their “right to demand for rescission of fraudulent act” (sagaikoui torikeshiken) under Civil Code of Japan (Act No. 89 of 1896, as amended) even if insolvency proceedings have not commenced yet. 264 ----- The acts that are subject to this right to demand for rescission of fraudulent act (sagaikoui torikeshiken) include: - any act by the debtor taken with the knowledge that such act will prejudice the creditor, and the beneficiary of such act was aware, at the time of the act, of the fact that such act will prejudice the creditor; and - any act that relates to the creation of a security interest or the extinguishment of obligations as to the already existing obligations and that: - (i) occurs while the debtor is, due to lack of ability to pay, generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due and (ii) is committed by the debtor in collusion with the beneficiary of the act with the intention to prejudice other creditors; or - (i) is not within the scope of the debtor’s obligation or the time of the act is not such that is required as the debtor’s obligation, (ii) occurs within 30 days prior to the debtor, due to lack of ability to pay, becoming generally and continuously unable to pay its debts as they become due and (iii) is committed by the debtor in collusion with the beneficiary of the act with the intention to prejudice other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

A U.S. court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes offered hereby or such guarantee if the Issuer or such guarantor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that payments to holders of the notes offered hereby constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: 265 ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. If the unsecured notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or any guarantor for amounts payable on the notes offered hereby would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by the Issuer or any guarantor. Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the unsecured notes offered hereby will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

Mexico’s bankruptcy statute, the Commercial Insolvency Law (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles) (“CIL”), provides for a judicial process where a Mexican subsidiary whose insolvency has been declared by a district court (federal jurisdiction). In an initial hearing, the Mexican subsidiary may negotiate an agreement with its creditors for the financial reorganization or liquidation of its assets in order to pay its monetary obligations. The agreement must be approved by all creditors and, if no agreement is reached, a second hearing is carried out through a purchase and sale of assets. The declaration of insolvency may be requested by the Mexican subsidiary its creditors, the Institute of Goods and Assets Management (Instituto de Administración de Bienes y Activos) or the district attorney. District Courts may order assets to be frozen during the duration of the judicial procedure to avoid potential dilution of assets. The issuance of the insolvency resolution entails the acknowledgement and effectiveness of a general retroactive clawback period of 270 calendar days from the issuance of such insolvency resolution (or 540 days for transactions with affiliates, the company’s directors or senior officers, or their relatives) from the issuance of such insolvency resolution; the conciliator appointed in the procedure or any creditor acknowledged by the district judge may request the district court to set a longer claw-back period in justified circumstances if the existence of a general breach of obligations can be demonstrated on a prior date (the “Clawback Date”). Certain transfers of assets and other acts unjustifiably and adversely affecting the company’s financial position that occurred during this period may be considered fraudulent and therefore, rendered ineffective. Pursuant to the CIL, the following are considered as fraudulent actions if made after the Clawback Date: (i) actions free of charge; (ii) actions and sales in which the company pays a consideration notably high or receives a consideration notably low to the consideration of its counterpart; (iii) operations transacted by the company in which conditions or terms are agreed that are significantly different to market conditions; (iv) waiver of debt; (v) payment of non-matured obligations by the company; and (vi) the discounts made by the company after the Clawback Date will be considered as an advance payment. 266 ----- In addition, any operations performed after the Clawback Date between the Mexican Subsidiary and (x) any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the company, (y) any entity that controls the company or (z) any entity that is controlled by the same company that controls the company shall be deemed as fraudulent acts. Under this last hypothesis, any claim you might make under the guarantees offered by the Mexican subsidiary in connection with the notes offered hereby would be unenforceable to the extent such guarantees were granted by the Mexican subsidiary as of the Clawback Date. According to the CIL, creditors in a bankruptcy case may be characterized as follows, each with a position in the corresponding credits waterfall: (a) Uniquely privileged creditors. Funeral expenses of the merchant, in cases that the Bankruptcy Resolution is being issued after the decease of the merchant, and medical expenses incurred as a result of the disease that caused the death of the merchant, in the event that the Bankruptcy Resolution be issued after merchant’s death; (b) Secured creditors. Creditors having as security of their debts either a lien or collateral covering property of debtor that could be garnished for collection of a debt (pledges and mortgages only). This, however, in the understanding that securities must be properly registered at the public registry of commerce, as they otherwise will be considered as unsecured debt; (c) Creditors holding a special privilege. Creditors holding a special privilege are those holding a security interest over the debtor’s (or a third party’s) property. Normally special privileged creditors have rights to withhold (with similar rights to those of the secured creditors), whenever a secured creditor considers that on the date the debtor is declared insolvent, the amount of the collateral is less than the amount due as principal and related financial surcharges, such creditor may request the district court to be acknowledged as _secured creditor for the amount such creditor assigns to the collateral, and as unsecured creditor for the balance; (d) Common creditors. All creditors that are not considered in the catalogue above; and (e) Subordinated creditors. The following are considered as subordinated creditors: (i) creditors that have agreed the subordination of their rights with respect with common loans and (ii) unsecured creditors. Any qualified labor claims established under applicable labor law will be paid before any of the abovementioned creditors. This includes labor salaries and benefits accrued since two years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy, as well as any pending unpaid severance packages, if any. The district court may declare the insolvency procedure as concluded if the estate is deemed insufficient to cover all payments in accordance with the credits waterfall.

As Ireland is a member of the European Union and the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is in force in Ireland, please see the section entitled “European Union” above. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings and other matters governed by Irish law for informational purposes only and does not address all the Irish legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the notes. _Preferred Creditors Under Irish Law_ Under Section 621 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 (as amended) (the “2014 Act”), in a winding-up of an Irish company certain preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Such preferential debts would typically comprise, among other things, certain amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, VAT, 267 ----- employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and salaries, wages and benefits of employees. In addition, there is a further limited category of “super-preferential” claims which take priority over ordinary preferential claims, as well as unsecured creditors and holders of floating security. These super-preferential debts comprise, among other things certain social welfare claims in respect of employment contributions that have been deducted from employees’ remuneration, which have not, in fact, been paid to those employees. The debts in question are treated as trust monies and the Irish Revenue Commissioners are regarded as the beneficial owners of such monies. The costs and expenses of a winding-up and the remuneration, costs and expenses of the liquidator rank ahead of preferential creditors, the holders of floating charges and unsecured creditors. In addition, priority will be afforded (including over the holders of fixed charges) to the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the Irish courts, (see “Examinership” below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession. _Unfair preferences_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the High Court to have certain transactions set aside on the basis that the transaction in question amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604 of the 2014 Act provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against an Irish company, which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor or any person on trust for any creditor, with a view of giving such creditor (or any guarantor for the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the other creditors within six months (or in the case of a connected person, two years) of the commencement of a winding up of the Irish company, shall be invalid. Case law relevant to Section 604 indicates that a dominant intent on the part of the entity concerned to prefer a creditor over its other creditors is necessary in order for Section 604 to apply. However, unless the contrary is shown, a preferential transaction made in favor of a connected person is deemed to have been made with a view to giving such a person a preference over other creditors and to be an unfair preference. Consequently, the burden of proof is on the connected person to show that the transaction was not an unfair preference. Section 604 is only applicable if, at the time of the conveyance, mortgage or other relevant act, the Irish company was unable to pay its debts as they became due. _Disclaimer of onerous contracts_ Section 615 of the 2014 Act confers power on a liquidator, with leave of the High Court, at any time within twelve months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as may be allowed by the Court, to disclaim any property of the Irish company being wound up which consists of, among other things, (i) land burdened with onerous covenants, (ii) unprofitable contracts or (iii) any property which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of money. The liquidator’s hand may be forced, in that any person interested in the property may require him to decide whether or not he will disclaim and if the liquidator wishes to disclaim in such circumstances, he must give notice within 28 days or such further period as may be allowed by the Court that he intends to apply to Court for leave to disclaim. A liquidator must disclaim the whole of the property, he may not keep part and disclaim part. A disclaimer terminates as and from the date of the disclaimer the rights, interest and liabilities of the company in the contract or the property, but, the disclaimer does not affect the rights or liabilities of any other person, except so far as necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability. Any person damaged by the operation of a disclaimer shall be deemed a creditor of the company to the amount of the damages and may prove that amount as a debt in the winding up. The meaning given to an unprofitable contract is one that would involve the liquidator in some liability. There must be some “burden” associated with the contract; the mere fact that the insolvent company’s estate would be better off by disclaimer is not enough. _Improperly transferred assets_ 268 ----- Under Section 608 of the 2014 Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court that any property of such company was disposed of (which would include by way of transfer, mortgage or security) and the effect of such a disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable, order any person who appears to have use, control or possession of such property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to challenge the improper transfer of assets has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purpose of Section 604 of the 2014 Act. Lastly, it may also be noted that where a company is being wound by the High Court, any disposition of the property of the company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the members of the company, made after the commencement of the winding-up and without the sanction of the liquidator (or in certain very limited circumstances, the sanction of a director), shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be void. _Examinership_ Examinership is a court procedure available under the 2014 Act to facilitate the survival of the whole or part of an Irish company or companies in financial difficulties. In circumstances where a company either (a) has its COMI for the purpose of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation in Ireland or (b) is a company incorporated under the 2014 Act and has its COMI for the purposes of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation outside the EU Member States to which the E.U. Insolvency Regulation apply (each an “Irish Examinership Company”) is unable, or likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that Irish Examinership Company, the directors of that Irish Examinership Company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that Irish Examinership Company, or shareholders of that Irish Examinership Company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of that Irish Examinership Company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that Irish Examinership Company. Provided the Irish Examinership Company can demonstrate viability, and can satisfy certain tests, the Irish High Court or, in the case of certain small companies, the Irish Circuit Court (each, a “Court”) appoints an independent examiner whose function is to supervise the restructuring process. Where the Court appoints an examiner to an Irish Examinership Company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the 2014 Act to a related company (as defined by section 2(10) of the 2014 Act) in accordance with section 517 of the 2014 Act, where that related company has a sufficient connection to Ireland such as to be capable of being wound up in Ireland. There can be no assurance that the Issuer or any guarantor would be exempt from an extension of the examinership. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the Irish Examinership Company or related company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court. The examiner, once appointed, under section 557 of the 2014 Act may apply to court during the examinership period to have certain transactions set aside and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the Irish Examinership Company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the Irish Examinership Company, or of a related company, or both, and the whole or any part of its or their undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court when it is satisfied that: a) a majority in number of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, representing a majority in value of the claims that would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, have accepted the proposals; or b) a majority of the voting classes of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement have accepted them, provided that at least one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors 269 ----- or is senior to the class of ordinary unsecured creditors (for example, creditors whose claims are afforded preferential status pursuant to statute); or where the condition prescribed in (i) above has not been satisfied, at least one voting class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement and who would be an “in the money creditor” in a liquidation has voted in favour of the scheme of arrangement. If a guarantor which is an Irish Examinership Company is placed in examinership, you may not be able to enforce your rights under its guarantee of the Notes. The effect of the appointment of an examiner is to suspend the enforcement rights of creditors for the protection period. For as long as an Irish Examinership Company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant Irish Examinership Company except with the consent of the examiner. No other proceedings in relation to the company may be commenced except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as it may impose. In addition, no payment may be made by a company during the period when it is under protection of the Court by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or any part of a liability incurred by the company before the date of presentation of the petition for the appointment of the examiner, unless the report of the independent accountant contains a recommendation to that effect, or unless the court, on application being made by the examiner or any interested party, shall so authorize it, if the Court is satisfied that a failure to do so would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going concern. The 2014 Act provides, inter alia, that no proceedings of any sort may be commenced against a guarantor in respect of the debts of the Irish Examinership Company in examinership (unless the guarantor is also under the protection of the Court). A creditor must serve notice on the guarantor, permitting the guarantor to exercise the creditor’s right to vote on the examiner’s proposed scheme of arrangement. If this is not done within the prescribed time limit, the guarantee will be unenforceable. The moratorium under the 2014 Act runs for an initial period of 70 days (and may be extended to 100 days at the discretion of the court) from the date of the presentation of the petition to the court for the appointment of the examiner. In addition to the extensions referenced above, the period may be further extended by the Court for such period as the court considers necessary to decide whether or not to confirm the proposals. The examiner’s proposals may generally provide for the forced write down of the Irish Examinership Company’s liabilities (including under a guarantee) to creditors and the High Court has determined that amounts due to secured creditors may also be written down. _Challenges to and Limitations of Guarantees_ The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees: If an Irish guarantor becomes subject to an Irish law insolvency proceeding and that Irish guarantor has obligations to creditors (other than noteholders) that are treated under Irish law as senior relative to the Irish guarantor’s obligations to the noteholders, the noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding. We believe that in the case of the guarantees given by an Irish guarantor, these will be given in good faith for the purposes of carrying on each of their businesses and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that they will benefit each such Irish guarantor. There can be no assurance, however, that the provision of the guarantees by an Irish guarantor would not be challenged by a liquidator, on the basis that the relevant Irish guarantor did not receive any benefit, or that a court would support this analysis. The guarantees to be granted by the Irish guarantor for the benefit of the holders of the notes will be limited so that they do not extend to or include any liability or sum which would cause such guarantee to be illegal including, without 270 ----- limitation, pursuant to Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) or Section 239 (Prohibition of loans, etc., to directors and connected persons) of the 2014 Act. 271 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,291

The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are released for sale, the initial purchasers may change the offering prices and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their respective affiliates. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (B) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, each initial purchaser has agreed that it or its brokerdealer affiliate will only offer and sell the notes in Canada to purchasers that have represented, or been deemed to have represented, that they qualify as “accredited investor” as defined in NI 45-106 that are also “permitted clients” as defined in NI 31-103 and that are not individuals. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We have agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the closing date of the offering of the notes, neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries or other affiliates over which we exercise management or voting control, nor any person acting on our behalf will, without the prior written consent of Goldman 272 ----- Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes. Each series of notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Neither we nor the Issuer intend to list any series of notes on any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for any series of notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. The ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes. If we were to cease being a reporting company under the SEC’s rules and regulations, the amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 and regulatory interpretations thereof by the SEC could restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes being offered hereby on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such initial purchasers in stabilizing or short-covering transactions. These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. The initial purchasers are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Specifically, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers act as arrangers, agents and lenders under our Credit Agreement, and may enter into certain hedging transactions with us that are secured under our Credit Agreement. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us and our affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments and those of our affiliates. Affiliates of the initial purchasers have also provided us with certain finance commitments in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC are also acting as the Company’s financial advisors with respect to the Mergers and will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are acting as arrangers, agents and lenders under our Credit Agreement and IAA’s existing indebtedness, 273 ----- and may receive certain of the proceeds used by the Company to refinance the Credit Agreement or repay such indebtedness. An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. is the administrative agent and a lender under the Credit Agreement. U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the initial purchasers, is an affiliate of the trustees and the escrow agent. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. We have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,291
