impact on the finance income line item on our consolidated income statement of e5.3 million and
e5.7 million for 2010 and 2011, respectively. Accordingly, we also restated associated line items for 2010

Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
acquisitions. We provide ‘‘constant currency’’ calculations to explain the impact of these items. When we
use the term ‘‘constant currency,’’ it means that we have translated financial data for a period into euros
using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous
period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our
operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary and segment performance.
We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors.
Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and,
consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal
business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact only reported
earnings and not our actual cash flow or economic condition.

The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 is unaudited and has been
calculated by aggregating the results of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the
three months ended March 31, 2014, and subtracting the results of operations data for the three months
ended March 31, 2013.

Certain numerical figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been subject to rounding
adjustments. Thus, discrepancies in tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur
due to such rounding.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations that
would apply if the Notes were to be registered in the United States.

**Other Financial Information**

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum includes some measures which are not
accounting measures within the scope of IFRS and which we use to assess the financial performance of
our businesses. These measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and other ratios
that use Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Conversion. We define Adjusted EBITDA as results from operating

viii

activities before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, income tax expense, net finance costs
and other income/(expenses), as set forth in our consolidated statement of income. For the year ended
December 31, 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014, we define other income/
(expenses) to include acquisition and litigation costs. We define EBITDA as results from operating
activities before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, income tax expense and net finance
costs.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and similar measures are used by different companies for
differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies.
You should exercise caution in comparing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as reported
by us with EBITDA and EBITDA margin (or Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin) as reported
by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA as presented here differs from the definition of ‘‘Consolidated
EBITDA’’ contained in the Indentures. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA margin is a
measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider either of Adjusted EBITDA or
Adjusted EBITDA margin as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in
accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other
measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin are relevant measures for assessing our performance because they are
adjusted for certain items which are non-recurring or which management believes are not indicative of
our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for other income
(expenses) to remove the effects of certain charges that we believe are not indicative of our underlying
operating performance. These charges relate primarily to substantial one-off acquisition, due diligence,
start-up, redundancy and restructuring costs. Some of these types of costs may be of recurring nature
but we do not adjust for any other items that we believe to occur in the normal course of business.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and ratios that we then measure have limitations as
analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our
results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin and other ratios that use Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would
be necessary for such replacements;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin and other ratios that use Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in
the future be made; and

- the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin and other ratios that use Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their
usefulness as comparative measures.

A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented in ‘‘Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Selected Operating and Financial Data.’’_

We define Cash Conversion as cash generated from operations divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

We believe that the presentation of Cash Conversion provides useful information to investors because it
is an operational performance measure that shows how much of our Adjusted EBITDA is converted into
net cash flows from operations. Cash Conversion is not a measure determined in accordance with IFRS,
and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.

**Other Data**

_Number of Client Entities_

Our results of operations are impacted by the number of clients we service. We calculate our number of
client entities as of any period as the number of client entities billed in that period, even if such client
entities are owned by the same beneficial owner. For example, we may bill the local subsidiary of a
multinational corporation for payroll services in one jurisdiction and bill another local subsidiary of the
same multinational corporation in a different jurisdiction for company secretarial services and would
record the transactions as being with two client entities even though ultimately owned by the same
multinational corporation. However, the number of client entities does not include those entities that we
establish and service as part of the operations of our international incorporations division which assists
clients in setting up and registering entities primarily in the British Virgin Islands. Where we refer to
‘‘clients’’ (instead of ‘‘client entities’’) we mean the larger business organization or ultimate beneficial
owner for which we service client entities.

_Full Time Equivalent (‘‘FTE’’)_

FTEs in a period are calculated by taking the average of the number of contracted permanent
employees of the Group at the beginning of a financial period and at the end of the same financial period.
Employees who work on a part-time basis are counted as the relevant fraction of a full time employee.
The number of employees of the Group exclude those nominee employees in certain jurisdictions
nominally on the payroll of the Group for purposes of the employment laws of a relevant jurisdiction but
whose salaries are paid by Group clients. The number of employees of the Group also excludes inactive
employees whose employment with the Group has not yet ended. The number of FTEs reported in our
Consolidated Financial Statements excludes these nominee and inactive employees and was reported
as 4,199, 4,217 and 4,419 in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and 4,349 and 4,634 in
the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014.

_Revenue per FTE_

We use revenue per FTE as an indicator of our operating performance. Revenue per FTE is calculated as
revenues for a period divided by FTEs for that period. Revenue per FTE is presented as an approximate
amount and rounded to the nearest hundred euros.

_Jurisdictions_

We refer to our presence in jurisdictions as meaning our presence in countries, overseas territories and
dependencies, but not regional states, local municipalities or similar jurisdictional entities.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights certain information contained in this Offering Memorandum. This summary does_
_not contain all the information you should consider before investing in the Additional Notes. You should_
_read this entire Offering Memorandum carefully, including ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and the financial statements and the notes_
_to those financial statements elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

We are a leading global provider of high value business services to clients operating and investing
globally. We focus on providing highly specialized and business-critical financial, legal and human
resource administrative services that enable our clients to operate their corporate structures, finance
vehicles and investment funds in different geographical locations. We operate from 116 offices in
82 jurisdictions across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. The range of services
covers:

- _Corporate services—integrated legal, administrative and accounting services for companies’_
operations from inception through day-to-day functions to liquidation;

- _Structured finance services—creating and administering financial vehicles for securitization_
transactions, structured asset leasing and project finance transactions;

- _Fund services—back office functions for a wide range of investment funds, including the_
preparation of accounts and daily net asset value (‘‘NAV’’) calculations; and

- _Private client services—administering corporate structures for high net worth individuals for wealth_
planning purposes.

Across our range of services, we offer our clients a core set of competencies that form the heart of our
product offering including:

- _Financial administrative services._ We provide a range of financial, accounting and reporting
services to assist our clients with their financial reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate
manner. We prepare statutory accounts to comply with local law requirements and offer
international management and consolidated reporting in accordance with major accounting
standards. We also provide assistance with the registration, recovery and compliance with valueadded taxes (‘‘VAT’’), insurance premium tax (‘‘IPT’’) and other indirect taxes. In addition, we
provide investment fund clients with fund accounting and valuation services.

- _Legal administrative services._ We provide a variety of legal administrative services to our clients in
connection with establishing and maintaining financing and holding companies and other
structures in compliance with applicable local laws. These services include establishing corporate
entities to serve as finance companies or as operating companies, as well as managing corporate
compliance procedures, such as organizing and recording board and shareholders’ meetings. We
also provide domiciliary and management services, as well as local representatives and directors
with the necessary expertise, required for clients to conduct business in a particular jurisdiction.

- _Human resource administrative services._ We provide a wide range of human resource and payroll
services, including payroll processing, management reporting and cost analysis and outsourced
human resource services. Our specialists can act as a client’s local human resources function,
preparing employment contracts and guidelines, providing employee training assistance and
securely maintaining personal confidential information.

Our service offerings enable our clients to focus on their core operations while we ensure that critical
local administrative functions, that clients may have less experience in providing, are performed to a high
standard. In doing so, we help our clients (i) gain access to specialized local knowledge, including
regulatory, tax and financial reporting expertise that would be challenging or inefficient to develop
internally, (ii) reduce the risks and distractions of managing complex accounting, legal and human
resource regulations in multiple countries, (iii) control costs by taking over the back office administration
and reporting functions of their international offices that are not large enough to justify the administrative
overhead, (iv) simplify operations by providing a single point-of-contact from anywhere in the world,
often resulting in increased transparency for our clients, and (v) execute globalization plans swiftly and
flexibly by using our worldwide network of local offices and experts to assist on administrative matters.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e401.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e108.9 million. A significant proportion of our overall revenue comes from our long-standing

clients. Our strategy for winning new business includes cross-selling and up-selling to these existing
clients, but it also focuses on building relationships with new clients across our business segments. In
the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, 78.1% of our revenue was generated from our corporate
services business segment, and 63.5% of our revenue was generated from our Benelux and EMEA
segments. Although a significant portion of our revenue is produced by our operations in Benelux, this
revenue is generated by clients from all over the world seeking to use our services in the perceived tax
efficient jurisdictions of the Netherlands and Luxembourg to service their international corporate
structures. As a result, a significant portion of this revenue is not directly tied to economic activity in the
Benelux region. We plan to continue to expand our operations into new markets in the Asia-Pacific
region and the Americas through organic growth and acquisitions.

Across our range of services, we have a diverse client base that includes multinational companies of
varying sizes, insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private companies
as well as high net-worth individuals. Our clients include companies using international subsidiaries to
conduct foreign commercial operations, and foreign entities to create more efficient overall corporate
structures. As of March 31, 2014, we provide services to more than 36,600 client entities. Our client base
is relatively fragmented, with the largest 20 clients contributing less than 6% of our revenue in 2013. Our
client entity retention rate was approximately 85% in each of the years from 2011 through 2013 and in the
first three months of 2014, reflecting the largely recurring nature of our business, which we believe
makes our business generally less susceptible to global business cycles. Management believes that this
percentage of client entity retention understates our underlying client retention as a number of our client
entities (e.g. Special Purpose Vehicle (‘‘SPV’’) financing entities) have a finite life and are replaced over
time. Such replacements are reflected as a loss of client entities (in calculating retention rates) even
though we typically retain the replacement business. A large proportion of our client base consists of
long-standing clients and these continuing relationships have been critical to our growth.

Our current global reach and breadth of expertise mean that we are one of the few business services
organizations able to offer clients global solutions while also being positioned as a neutral
execution-only service provider (meaning, we are not affiliated with an accounting, financial or law firm)
and thus do not have similar issues with being conflicted out of taking on new work. We believe that we
are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the growing opportunities presented by the globalization
of business and the growing trend of businesses outsourcing support functions.

**Strengths**

We believe that our success to date and our potential for future growth are primarily attributable to the
following strengths:

**_A Leading Provider of High Value Business Services with a Broad Geographic Footprint and Service_**
**_Offering_**

We are a leading global provider of high value business-critical financial, legal and human resource
administrative services with an established track record and strong reputation for delivering quality
service to our clients. In addition, we benefit from being a neutral, execution-only provider as we are not
affiliated with an accounting, tax, financial or law firm. Because we do not have such affiliations, we can
provide clients with a broad range of services that many international accounting and legal firms cannot
or do not offer due to conflicts issues.

We are able to offer our clients multiple competencies across several service areas in end-markets
around the globe. By comparison, many of our competitors do not offer all of our services or do not offer
services in all of the jurisdictions where we have a presence, either due to a lack of local expertise or
conflict of interest. We currently have 116 offices in 82 jurisdictions, including major developing markets
such as Brazil, India, Russia and China, which enables clients to conduct business globally using a
single service provider (as opposed to multiple service providers across different jurisdictions). This
provides us with the opportunity to service our clients as they expand geographically. For example, in the
event that a client wishes to expand its corporate structure or close and shift operations to a new country,
we are able to provide the same services across a number of jurisdictions while maintaining a
comparable quality of service. This gives us a significant advantage over competitors who lack this
global footprint (such as locally-operated accounting firms) when working with multinational businesses.

**_Local Expertise and Provision of Value Added Services_**

We offer a range of customized service offerings to help our clients manage various administrative,
corporate compliance and reporting requirements. Through our experienced global workforce, we
provide clients with access to local expertise across our offices, enabling them to operate their business
in many jurisdictions with confidence and we believe at a lower cost than if such businesses performed
those services on their own.

We provide a range of financial, accounting and reporting services to assist our clients with their financial
reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate manner. We also provide non-advisory services to
our clients to establish and maintain financing, holding and other structures in compliance with
applicable local laws. We provide a range of flexible and scalable human resource and payroll services
at the local level in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These services cover numerous aspects of
employee-related administrative affairs, including payroll processing, management reporting and cost
analysis and outsourced human resource services.

The majority of the services we provide ensure that our clients’ administrative and financial processes
are compliant with relevant regulations. Thus, our services are critical to our clients from a financial,
reputational and risk management perspective. The effectiveness of our services depends on a
combination of local knowledge of relevant regulatory frameworks and expertise. Such a combination
can be costly for our clients to develop internally in each of their jurisdictions of operation and, frequently,
our clients do not have the local scale or desire to perform these functions themselves. Our services not
only generally reduce operating costs for our clients, but also typically reduce initial start-up costs
associated with entering a new jurisdiction, increase the speed at which our clients can set up new
subsidiaries and preserve operational flexibility by allowing our clients to scale their operations up or
down with greater ease. As a result, our services allow our clients to focus their resources on revenue
generating operations and reduce associated administrative, compliance and reporting expenses,
without sacrificing the integrity of such functions.

We believe the price we charge for the services we offer is often a lesser consideration for our clients,
given the potential impact to their business if there are errors or deadlines that are not met. This is
important to our continued success as we believe the key purchasing criteria for our clients has
historically been the quality of the service provided and our local knowledge and expertise. We believe
our clients’ satisfaction is evidenced by our high client entity retention rates of approximately 85% in
each of the years from 2011 through 2013 and in the first three months of 2014. We believe that this high
retention rate is also driven by the depth of our knowledge of our clients’ activities and the regions in
which we operate, which cannot be easily reproduced by potential new entrants in the market.

We are focused on winning business in the high value, expertise-reliant segment of the business
services market. We generally seek to avoid competing with the mainstream Business Process
Outsourcing (‘‘BPO’’) service providers or in standardized segments where services are commoditized
and primarily driven by cost. By comparison, we believe the competitive advantage of our financial,
administrative and human resource administrative services lies with the quality of work we can provide.
Accordingly, instead of relying solely on cost advantages, we rely on our skilled local specialists (many
of whom have professional qualifications) and a correspondingly strong reputation among existing
clients and established service providers, such as law, tax and accountancy firms (which we refer to as
‘‘business referrers’’), to foster client confidence in our quality. We believe that this in turn has resulted in
a significant source of client introductions which we believe is difficult for new service providers to
replicate.

**_Resilient Business Model Based on Stable Revenue Generation and Strong Cash Conversion_**

Once established, the services we provide to clients have historically had a high degree of predictability,
with macro-economic fluctuations in any particular country or globally generally having limited impact
on our clients’ requirements for our financial, legal and human resource administrative services or on the
number of existing structures that we service. For instance, many of our services, such as statutory
accounting and corporate filings by our clients, are legally required on an annual basis regardless of a
client’s overall financial or operational performance.

One of the advantages of our business model is that shorter-term macro-economic trends that are
detrimental to many other businesses can increase demand for our services. For example, while
businesses may seek to reduce overall headcount in a recession which can reduce demand for our

3


-----

payroll administrative services in a given jurisdiction, a global business may seek to move this
headcount to a lower wage jurisdiction where we also provide payroll administrative services, or may
seek to otherwise adapt its corporate structure to changing economic conditions by expanding into new
markets. Such practices can result in an increase in demand for our corporate services.

Generally, our service contracts generate revenue based on either a fixed fee, an hourly rate, or both. We
have a relatively stable client base with client entity retention rates of approximately 85% in each of the
years from 2011 through 2013 and in the first three months of 2014, which reflects the largely recurring
nature of our business. This has historically resulted in generally predictable revenue generation that
provides us visibility over a significant portion of our expected annual revenue at the commencement of
each financial year.

We also benefit from strong Cash Conversion, which was 99%, 101% and 92% in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively. We are a service-focused business with relatively limited need for land, plant or equipment
or, compared to more generic business process outsourcing providers, complex IT infrastructures and
we therefore have limited requirements for capital expenditure. We also have limited working capital
needs because our customer receivables are partially offset by advanced payments from customers.

**_Favorable Global Economic and Regulatory Trends_**

We expect that growth in our business will continue to be driven by the trend towards globalization,
exhibited by multi-national corporations expanding outside of their home jurisdiction. In expanding
operations globally, we believe that our clients and potential clients will likely increasingly rely on outside
service providers to deal with the global trend towards increasing regulation and an emphasis on
transparency of corporate and financial activities. We expect these trends to continue to support the
expansion of our business in the near- to medium-term. In particular, we expect to benefit from the
following trends:

- _Continued international expansion by businesses._ The international expansion of our current and
potential clients drives our business. As companies expand into new geographies, it is often easier
to engage us to provide administrative support so that clients do not need to invest in local
infrastructure (particularly where they are establishing only a small presence) and can instead focus
on their core business. Rising levels of foreign direct investment across international borders from
advanced economies to developing economies and between advanced and developing economies
in recent years has helped us expand our business, and we expect that this increasing globalization
will help us to continue to grow.

- _Increasingly stringent regulatory regimes._ The global trend of increased regulation and
enforcement thereof has emphasized the importance of local regulatory and compliance expertise.
The wide variety of local legal and regulatory requirements highlights the need for specific local
expertise, especially for businesses that lack the critical mass to obtain and maintain such expertise
in-house. Increasingly complex regulatory and tax environments and differing accounting
standards in individual geographies drive demand for our book-keeping and reporting services.

- _Increased transparency and independence._ The recent economic crises have led to increased
demand for transparency in accounting and reporting. For example, in our structured financial
services and fund services businesses, the demand for more current and accurate reporting as to
the performance of a structure or a fund, and demand for independence in administration of such
structures, has created increased demand for our services from our fund and structured vehicle
clients.

- _Evolving client needs._ Our clients increasingly outsource non-core functions and demand global
solutions for their outsourced administrative services needs. For example, it is easier, and we
believe often cheaper, for a client to engage a single reliable firm to perform their book-keeping,
local reporting and human resources administration services across a number of countries than to
engage different providers in each country.

We think our global network of offices provides an effective platform for capitalizing on these trends and
the scalability and resources to take advantage of growth in any particular market. We expect that these
trends will also attract new clients and provide us with opportunities to cross-sell to existing clients.

**_Diverse Customer Base_**

We have a diverse client base, including approximately 40% of the Fortune Global 500. Across our range
of services, we have a diverse client base which includes multinational companies of varying sizes,
insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private companies as well as high
net-worth individuals. As of March 31, 2014, we provide services to more than 36,600 client entities, with
the largest 20 clients contributing less than 6% of our revenue in 2013. We work with organizations
located in a broad range of geographies across a spectrum of industries, and we have formed
specialized teams with the necessary sector experience to ensure the continued quality of our service
offerings. This industry-focused approach has enabled us to offer a comprehensive suite of specific
tailored services to clients and to leverage these capabilities to win additional clients. For example, our
expertise in servicing a particular industry also enables us to develop client relationships that may
involve only a few tasks upon our initial engagement, but can later develop into a broader engagement
whereby we provide a client with new services or the same services in new jurisdictions.

**_Experienced Executive Management Team, with Incentives at Local Management Level to Grow_**
**_Our Business_**

We have a highly experienced executive management team at the global level with in-depth industry
knowledge. Our Chief Executive Officer, Hugo van Vredenburch, has over twenty years of business
experience and prior to joining us served as the Chief Executive Officer of Equity Trust, a position he held
from 2005, where he developed a detailed insight into our industry.

Gordon Stuart, our Chief Financial Officer and a qualified accountant, has significant outsourcing
industry experience, having worked with both private equity backed and publicly listed companies in this
sector.

In addition, our Chief Operating Officer, Frederik van Tuyll has served in significant management roles in
the sector. Mr. van Tuyll joined Equity Trust in 1994.

We provide management at the local level with incentives to continue to grow our business. We have
encouraged an entrepreneurial approach within our management, operating a relatively flat
management structure with managers across each of our regions and business lines reporting directly
to a regional director.

Our managers are incentivized and empowered to drive their individual businesses forward under
regional and central guidance from the Group on strategic directives and policies. In addition, our
management has a significant equity stake in the business, from the executive board to local
management teams. We believe this ensures that all levels of our management team are incentivized to
achieve our overall business plan.

**Strategy**

The key components of our strategy are as follows:

**_Continued Growth Through Penetration of Our Existing Client Base_**

We have a broad and diverse client base that includes many leading global corporations. We believe that
there are significant opportunities to provide additional services to our existing clients, and we intend to
leverage our extensive service range and expertise to cross-sell other services to our existing customers.
To that end, we created a global sales force that proactively manages client accounts and seeks to
broaden the array of services we provide to our clients. We also intend to continue to leverage our
international network to offer our services to clients in any jurisdiction where they do business. For
example, we provide administrative services in some countries where clients operate but not in others.
We intend to use our broad geographic footprint to provide our clients with a seamless service and
single point of contact wherever in the world they look to do business.

**_Further Growth of Our Network_**

Our growth strategy is based primarily on balanced organic growth. We intend to continue to expanding
our operations in countries where we see compelling growth opportunities, such as the United States,
Brazil, Russia, India, China, Norway and Indonesia. We pursue organic growth by expanding the size of
our existing offices to service new clients, providing additional types of services, and opening offices in

new countries or expanding the number of our offices in a country. In the last twelve months, we have
opened new offices in Qatar and Canada. We typically open new offices when we have requests from
existing clients to provide services in new locations. These are often in locations where we have
previously referred client work to a third-party provider and have determined that future business
prospects will be sufficient to cover the costs associated with opening a new office. We intend to
continue to increase the scale of our global network through organic growth in regions where our
existing clients are present and where we see attractive opportunities to win new clients.

We may also expand our operations through acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. We have
grown our business in the past through acquisitions with a targeted and disciplined acquisition strategy
that we expect to continue to apply to make acquisitions going forward if suitable opportunities arise. In
the final quarter of 2013, we acquired Accepta A.S., one of the Norway’s largest accounting groups. In
January 2014, we acquired the assets and liabilities of PT Tass Axia Solusi, an Indonesian company,
which expanded our presence in Indonesia. To expand our other fund services offerings, we also
acquired the non-controlling interest in the Custom House Group in January 2014, which was subject to
regulatory approval, which we received in the second quarter of 2014. In July 2014, we entered into a
share purchase agreement (the ‘‘Share Purchase Agreement’’) pursuant to which we agreed to
purchase 100% of the share capital of KCS, an independent pan-Asian corporate services provider
specializing in corporate accounting, corporate secretarial and payroll services.

**_Expand Our Range of Services, Including Through Strategic Arrangements_**

We continually assess the range of services we offer to meet the diverse needs of our clients. We have
recently begun offering clients assistance with the registration, recovery and compliance with IPT and
other indirect taxes, including the payment and collection of refunds. We also now provide structuring
services for aircraft, vessel and other significant asset leasing arrangements, as well as royalty fee
administration, process agent services and loan agency services. We continually evaluate the market
demand for our services to determine whether there are additional opportunities for us to expand the
range of services we provide.

We are also focused on expanding our range of strategic arrangements where we can complement the
services being provided by other market participants. For instance, we have collaborated with a global
payroll services company to jointly bid for service contracts where our geographic scope and presence
in multiple markets can complement that global service company’s payroll services expertise. We
believe that such strategic partnerships can help us take advantage of opportunities where either our
geographic scope or broad service offering can complement the services of our partner to jointly serve
key clients on projects we might not otherwise be able to win individually.

**_Continued Integration of Our Global Network_**

Our business has evolved from a combination of separate businesses around the globe into a global
network of 116 offices in 82 jurisdictions. Due to the importance of local expertise and client contact, our
offices each have a local managing director that reports to their respective regional director. As our
business has grown, we have increasingly integrated the operations of our offices, implementing
group-wide strategies as well as a group-wide sales function, in an effort to realize the economies of
scale enabled by our expansion. We also seek to achieve efficiencies by leveraging group-wide
infrastructure for several key functions. We are continuing the integration of our IT infrastructure across
many of our offices, and our key business application now covers a large portion of our offices.

**Trading Update**

We believe that our revenue for the second quarter of 2014 will be marginally higher than our revenue for
the second quarter of 2013. We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2014 will be
marginally lower than our Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2013.

The above information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational
results for the full year 2014. The preliminary estimates above were prepared based on a number of
assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change.
Accordingly, our actual results for the full year 2014 may vary from our preliminary estimates above, and
such variations could be material. See ‘‘Notice on Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a
more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of
operation.

**Our Sponsor**

Doughty Hanson is a leading private equity firm specializing in investments in businesses
headquartered in or whose businesses are primarily based in Europe. Doughty Hanson traces its history
back to 1985 when Nigel Doughty and Richard Hanson started working together on European buyout
investments. It is based in London, United Kingdom, with additional offices across Europe.

**The Acquisition**

On July 12, 2014 (the ‘‘Signing Date’’), we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which
we agreed to purchase 100% of the share capital of KCS, an independent pan-Asian corporate services
provider specializing in corporate accounting, corporate secretarial and payroll services from UCL Asia
Partners L.P. (‘‘UCL’’ or the ‘‘Seller’’). We expect the Acquisition to be completed in the second half of
2014. In the event that we do not complete the Acquisition, we intend to allocate the net proceeds to
working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. See ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds.’’_

KCS is a pan-Asian corporate services provider that has approximately 470 employees throughout 14
locations in Asia Pacific, with a particularly strong presence in China. KCS provides a comprehensive set
of corporate services, consisting primarily of (i) corporate accounting and financial services, including
management accounts and other internal finance functions, outsourcing for bookkeeping and financial
control, (ii) corporate secretarial services, including company formation and secretarial services,
including the opening of bank accounts, direct appointments, share transfers, board meetings and the
preparation of annual returns, (iii) payroll services, including benefits administration and processing and
(iv) other services, including private client trustee services, listing services, fund administration and
family office services.

We expect that the Acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to expand our Asia footprint,
particularly in China and more generally in East and Southeast Asia. KCS provides services in a number
of markets that have been recently successful in attracting foreign direct investment. Post-Acquisition,
we would seek to broadly align KCS’s results of operations with the Group’s operational metrics in that
region.

We believe that the acquisition of KCS will provide us with broad, well-diversified channels for sourcing
new business in Asia, particularly through referrals from international audit firms and through crossselling new products and services to KCS’s existing clients. KCS is well-recognized within the industry,
and provides services to a wide-ranging client portfolio base, which includes Fortune 500 companies,
large multinational groups, private companies and small- and medium-sized enterprises. KCS provides
its services to a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, automotive, energy, chemicals,
machinery, pharmaceuticals, information technology, home appliances, retail, finance and insurance.
KCS is led by an experienced management team consisting of individuals with an average of over
20 years of experience in the accounting and corporate services sectors and extensive contacts within
the corporate services industry.

We and KCS provide services in six overlapping jurisdictions: China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore,
Taiwan and Vietnam. Although we provide similar services to KCS in these overlapping markets, we
believe that KCS generally has a distinct, complementary set of clients within key industry segments,
such as retail, luxury retail, automotive and technology. Furthermore, the overlap between us and KCS
provides an opportunity to extract cost savings through process improvements and elimination of
certain duplicative costs. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’

Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will take steps to integrate KCS. Leveraging institutional
knowledge from our previous mergers and acquisitions, we will appoint an integration project manager
and put in place a dedicated project management office. We will develop a detailed project plan and
work plan and assign our team members with clear roles, responsibilities and deliverables.

(3) The obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors.
The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations are secured by pledges of shares and assets of our
subsidiaries as described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’ Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, any liabilities in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations that are permitted to be
secured by Collateral will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
Collateral. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility have been repaid and certain hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied
pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and any
other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by Collateral on a pari passu basis
pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

(4) On the Issue Date, the same assets that secure the Existing Senior Secured Notes will also secure the Additional Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. See
‘‘Summary—The Offering.’’

(5) The Existing Senior Notes are senior obligations of the Issuer and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the
Guarantors.

(6) The Additional Senior Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by
the Guarantors.

(7) The Issuer entered into the Revolving Credit Facility on the Initial Issue Date, providing for up to e70 million of senior secured
borrowings and letters of credit and other ancillary facilities. The Issuer and the Guarantors are borrowers or guarantors
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility shares in the Collateral. In the event of an enforcement of the
Collateral, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the
RCF (or any repayment facilities) and counterparties to certain hedging obligations have been repaid in full. The RCF is a
senior obligation of the Issuer and ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior debt of the Issuer.
The RCF is guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors.

(8) As of March 31, 2014, the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors had e9.6 million of indebtedness and e65.9 million
of trade payables and other liabilities outstanding, excluding the provisions, retirement benefit obligations and FIT liabilities.
To secure the Senior Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging transactions, we pledged the shares of
Equity Trust Holdings S.`a r.l. and TMF Luxembourg Holding S.A. in the share capital of TMF Luxembourg S.A. (the
‘‘Luxembourg Regulated Entity’’), which is not permitted to guarantee the Notes without regulatory approval. The
Guarantors, excluding the Luxembourg Regulated Entity, represented 60.8% of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and held 52.6% of the Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31, 2014. The
Luxembourg Regulated Entity, together with the Guarantors, represented 82.1% of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and held 58.7% of the Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31,
2014. The Guarantees will be subject to contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain circumstances.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Regulatory and Legislative Frameworks in Which We Operate.’’ There are
circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes will be released automatically and under which the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the Senior Note Guarantees
will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the relevant Trustee.

Any additional security interests that may in the future be
pledged to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture would also constitute Collateral.

The security interests over the Collateral may be released
under certain circumstances. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_relating to the Additional Senior Secured Notes.’’ There are_
circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the
Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Guarantees will
be released automatically. See ‘‘Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreements’’ and ‘‘Description of_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with
respect to the Notes or Guarantees will be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes unless
required by law. If the Issuer or any Guarantor is required by
law to withhold or deduct taxes with respect to a payment to the
holders of the Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will,
subject to certain exceptions, pay additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of the
Notes after such withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of that
withholding or deduction. See ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Additional Amounts’’ and ‘‘Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Additional Amounts.’’_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering to fund the
purchase price of the Acquisition, as well as for working capital
and general corporate purposes, which may include future
acquisitions. In the event that we do not complete the
Acquisition, we intend to allocate the net proceeds to working
capital and general corporate purposes, which may include
future acquisitions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**Optional Redemption:**

Senior Secured Notes . . . . . . . . . . . At any time prior to maturity, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the
Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices set forth under
the caption ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—

ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013; and

- our unaudited condensed consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information
as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2014, and comparative summary unaudited
condensed consolidated income statement and cash flow information as of and for the three month
period ended March 31, 2013.

Our consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been extracted without material adjustment from the
Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety

(2) Adjusted EBITDA means results from operating activities before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, and other
income/expense as set forth in our consolidated statement of operations. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe
that this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of
companies in our industries. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. In addition, other companies in our
industries may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or may use it for different purposes than we do, limiting its usefulness as
a comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our operating performance that is not required by, or presented in
accordance with, IFRS and has not been calculated in accordance with the definition of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ as defined
under the ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ or ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’ Adjusted EBITDA is not a
measurement of our operating performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to profit for the year,
operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from
operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of its business. See ‘‘Certain Definitions and Presentation of Financial
_and Other Data Financial Information.’’ Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for other income/(expenses) to remove the_
effects of certain charges that we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. These charges relate
primarily to substantial one-off acquisition, due diligence, start-up, redundancy and restructuring costs. Some of these costs
may be recurring in nature, but we do not adjust for any other items that we believe occur in the normal course of business.

The following data sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to result for the year for the periods indicated:

(3) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.

(4) Total third-party debt is total loans and borrowings excluding capitalized finance costs, long-term supply arrangements,
advance customer payments and deferred consideration and Subordinated Shareholder Funding.

(5) Net third-party debt is total loans and borrowings excluding capitalized finance costs, long-term supply arrangements,
advance customer payments and deferred consideration, Subordinated Shareholder Funding less cash and cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash subject to regulatory restrictions on transfer and cash that has been
pledged to secure cash collateralized debt obligations.

(6) Net adjusted finance costs is net finance costs excluding foreign exchange losses on financing activities and the interest
expense on Subordinated Shareholder Funding.

(7) In order to calculate Total Third-party debt/Adjusted EBITDA and Net Third-party debt/Adjusted EBITDA we use Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended as of March 31.

(8) Pro forma data and ratios give effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if such
issuance had occurred on March 31, 2014, in the case of balance sheet data, or on April 1, 2014, in the case of income
statement data.

-----

(9) Pro forma total third-party debt is total third-party debt as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the Additional
Notes as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if such issuance had taken place on March 31, 2014.

(10) Pro forma cash and cash equivalents is cash and cash equivalents as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the
Additional Notes as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if such issuance had taken place on March 31, 2014 (for
avoidance of doubt, no adjustments are made for the Acquisition). Cash and cash equivalents includes cash subject to
regulatory restrictions on transfer of e4.4 million and cash that has been pledged to secure cash collateralized debt
obligations of e20.2 million, including cash box loans.

(11) Pro forma net third-party debt is net third-party debt as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the Additional
Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if such transaction had taken
place on March 31, 2014.

(12) Pro forma net adjusted finance costs is calculated by giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes as
described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if such issuance had taken place on March 31, 2014. Pro forma net adjusted finance
cost represents net adjusted finance costs for the period, adjusted by adding interest costs and amortization cost to give pro
forma effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes. Adjusted EBITDA/pro forma net adjusted finance costs does not
necessarily reflect the calculation of the Issuer’s Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes’’ or ‘‘Description of Senior Notes.’’_

(13) Adjusted EBITDA/Pro forma net adjusted finance costs does not necessarily reflect the calculation of the Issuer’s
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as defined in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ or ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Notes.’’_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. The risks and uncertainties below are_
_those that we consider to be material. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our_
_business, financial condition, results of operation, future prospects or the trading price of the Additional_
_Notes, and investors could lose all or part of their investment. We have described the risks and_
_uncertainties that we believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we_
_face. Additional risks and uncertainties of ours that are not currently known to us, or that we currently_
_deem immaterial, may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and future prospects. If this occurs, the trading price of the Additional Notes may decline, and_
_investors could lose all or part of their investment._

_The order in which the risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence_
_or the magnitude of their potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, future_
_prospects or the trading price of the Additional Notes. Investors should consider carefully whether an_
_investment in the Additional Notes is suitable for them in light of the information in this Offering_
_Memorandum and their personal circumstances._

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_We may be adversely affected by current, potential and pending legal or administrative_**
**_proceedings initiated, or to be initiated, against us and any resulting judgments, settlements and_**
**_orders rendered by competent authorities._**

We are from time to time involved in litigation related to our business. Many of these claims allege breach
of directors’ or trustee’s fiduciary duties and/or breach of contract. See ‘‘Business—Litigation.’’ We may
also be subject to other claims and judicial and administrative proceedings incurred in the course of our
current and past operations, including employment-related disputes, contract disputes, government
audits and proceedings, client disputes, tax issues and tort claims. Historically, we have been subject to
claims where a subsidiary has acted as administrator or director of investment or finance vehicles, and
some of those claims have sought damages for the entire amount of the underlying investment, which
can be substantial. Our involvement in litigation (or potential litigation) may increase beyond historical
levels. In particular, the private client business has historically had a greater number of legal disputes.

Responding to and defending against current and potential claims may be expensive and can result in
diversion of management resources, and the outcomes of any such claim may be materially adverse to
our business, financial condition and results of our operation and/or our reputation, and may increase
our regulatory costs and/or insurance premiums. In some proceedings, the claimant may seek damages
as well as other relief, which, if granted, would require substantial expenditure or impose restrictions on
our part. We may ultimately incur liability charges or expenses in excess of insurance coverage.
Litigation can also lead to regulatory investigation or other scrutiny, and could adversely affect our
reputation. Additionally, any litigation in the Netherlands and Luxembourg may be more likely to have a
material and adverse effect on us because we derive a relatively high share of our revenue from those
jurisdictions, and are regulated in those jurisdictions and any litigation may trigger adverse regulatory
consequences.

Claims in relation to litigation to which we are party are not only in euro but also in different currencies,
which may expose us to foreign exchange risk.

We may be also adversely affected by investigations by any relevant regulatory or administrative
agencies which in certain jurisdictions could have adverse consequences on our ability to carry on our
business as discussed further in ‘‘Regulation.’’ An adverse outcome of any investigation by a relevant
regulatory or administrative agency or other inquiries from regulatory bodies (including the regulatory
investigations referred to in ‘‘Business—Litigation’’) may have a material adverse effect on us and result
in:

- the institution of administrative or civil proceedings;

- sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties, including potential loss of regulatory licenses
depending on the severity and scale of any regulatory issues; by way of example, we were recently
the subject of a fine by our regulator in the BVI for certain historical regulatory shortcomings
(currently being addressed through a comprehensive remedial review);

- changes in personnel;

22


-----

- our inability to conduct business in the jurisdiction in which the proceedings take place due to the
loss of our regulatory license or certain restrictions/conditions being placed on our activities; and

- increased review and scrutiny of our services by our clients, regulatory authorities (in the jurisdiction
where the relevant investigation is conducted and also potentially other jurisdictions where we are
regulated), the media and others.

Historically, the number of litigation claims (or threatened claims) has increased during economic
downturns. This derives from a course of events where we render services to client entities in which
clients and investors lose money and therefore no longer have the resources to meet their financial
obligations. When this occurs, liquidators and investors of our clients may seek to recover from persons
involved with that entity, under the assumption that they have somehow contributed to the losses or
failed to comply fully with any legal duties.

We have taken no provisions for litigation liabilities, including the current litigation referred to in
‘‘Business—Litigation.’’ We have only taken provisions for certain legal costs associated with defending
some of those litigation matters, but these provisions may not be adequate to satisfy any legal costs
associated with defending the current claims for which cost provisions have been taken. Even if we or
our directors, officers and employees (as the case may be) are not ultimately found to be liable,
defending such claims or lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming, divert management
resources and harm our reputation or attract regulatory inquiries, all of which may ultimately adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant judgment against us or
settlement could exceed our available cash resources and could adversely affect our reputation and
regulatory status.

Our contracts with clients typically require us to perform our services for them to certain levels and in
accordance with certain requirements. If our services fall short of these agreed levels of service
(including by errors made by our employees in the course of delivering such services), we may be
subject to claims by our clients for damages that could be substantial depending on the nature of the
breach of contract.

**_We rely on our insurance coverage, in particular our outside directors’ and officers’ insurance_**
**_liability and/or professional indemnity liability insurance, and we may be unable to obtain or_**
**_maintain such coverage in the future, such coverage may prove to be inadequate, or we may have_**
**_disputes with our insurers._**

We maintain insurance against certain business risks. Our insurance, however, has deductibles,
coverage exclusions (including fraud) and maximum levels of recovery. Thus, we may not be adequately
insured against all types of risks that are associated with the conduct of our business. Additionally, any
claims made under an insurance policy potentially limit the maximum amount of insurance coverage for
us moving in the future and/or may increase our premiums. The maximum amount recoverable under
our insurance policies is typically calculated on an aggregate annual basis. Therefore, any claims
against our insurance policies reduces our potential recovery for all such claims made in the same year
(e.g. if we received two or more substantial claims under one insurance policy in the same year that were
near the maximum level of our insurance coverage, we may have substantial uninsured exposure to
such a claim).

We may not be able to, or may choose not to, obtain or maintain insurance coverage for all types of
claims or litigation that we are exposed to. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or
otherwise protect against potential claims, we will be exposed to significant potential liabilities, which
may negatively impact our reputation and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations. Furthermore, a successful claim brought against us in excess of, or for claims
excluded from, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations. Additionally, the occurrence of an event that is uninsurable or losses not
covered by the relevant policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

Our business exposes us to risks of claims being made against us and our directors, officers and
employees. Such claims could involve those made by our clients due to, for example, losses incurred as
a result of declines in fund assets administered by us or losses incurred by them relating to structured
finance transactions administered by an SPV incorporated by us with directors appointed by us. In such
circumstances, clients could bring claims against us and our directors, officers and employees.

23


-----

We maintain combined professional indemnity insurance, outside directors’ and officers’ liability and
directors’ and officers’ insurance to mitigate such risks (subject to various deductibles and exclusions,
including fraud). However, any such liability incurred by us as a consequence of such claims may not be
covered by insurance or may exceed our insurance coverage (because the claim exceeds the limitation
of our policy or one or more claims under the same insurance policy reduce our maximum insurance
coverage under such policy). We would be liable for any outstanding balance.

Our professional indemnity insurance policy provides some limited cover for certain instances of fraud
committed by our employees, but generally recovery for fraud is not permitted under our insurance
policies. From time to time, we have disputes with our insurers regarding issues such as (i) the level of
deductible for a particular claim, (ii) what insurance policy a particular claim or potential claim may fall
under (i.e. what year it falls under could be important if a number of claims have been made under a
particular insurance policy), and (iii) whether a particular claim or potential claim is covered by the
insurance policy. We may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of any such dispute as we
may be uninsured for a particular item or ultimately exposed to greater liability to the underlying litigation
or circumstances as a result of a dispute with our insurer.

**_We may be adversely affected by regulatory investigations, audits, complaints and/or failure to_**
**_comply with applicable laws or the conditions attaching to our regulatory licenses that could lead_**
**_to regulatory fines, sanctions, conditions on our licenses or loss of our licenses._**

As discussed under ‘‘Regulation,’’ we are regulated in 17 jurisdictions. If we breach applicable laws
(generally or in relation to the jurisdictions where we are regulated) or the terms of our regulatory
licenses, this could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in a jurisdiction by
the implementation of conditions to our regulatory licenses or otherwise or, in certain circumstances, a
loss of our regulatory license. Fines and sanctions can be material depending on the jurisdiction and the
conduct giving rise to the issue. Additionally, if we lost our regulatory license, we would not be able to
continue to offer services in such jurisdictions and this could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, the financial condition and prospects of the business, particularly if this were to occur in the
Netherlands, Luxembourg or the British Virgin Islands.

In most regulated jurisdictions, our key employees are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators and if
their conduct is deemed to violate applicable law or the expectations of regulators this may have
implications for their involvement in the business. Depending on the person and the jurisdiction, this
could have a substantial impact on the Group, including that they may no longer be considered fit and
proper persons to hold their position within the Group. See the discussion under ‘‘Regulation.’’

In addition, we may be exposed to additional regulatory scrutiny due to litigation proceedings.
See ‘‘—We may be adversely affected by current, potential and pending legal or administrative
_proceedings initiated, or to be initiated, against us and any resulting judgments, settlements and orders_
_rendered by competent authorities.’’_

Breaches of any applicable laws could result in fines/penalties, litigation, tax and/or reputational harm,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and business
prospects.

**_Our business reputation is very important to our continued viability and any damage to such_**
**_reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our reputation is very important to our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former
and potential clients, business referrers, the investment management and financial services
communities, and the industries that these entities and people serve. Any damage to our reputation,
whether arising from litigation, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our
financial reporting or compliance with administrative agencies in the territories in which we operate,
negative publicity, or the conduct of our business or our clients or otherwise, could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business and retain existing clients, which may ultimately
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A deterioration in market and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, particularly_**
**_global expansion by existing and potential clients, which could materially impair our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital._**

Deterioration in global economic conditions and gross domestic product (‘‘GDP’’) in the countries in
which we operate may adversely affect our business, growth and results of operations. A global or
significant regional economic slowdown or recession could harm us by adversely affecting our clients’
and our prospective clients’ access to capital to fund their businesses and their ability to sustain and
grow their businesses, particularly their ability to expand internationally. This could result in a decline in
our clients’ demand for our services and their ability to pay our invoices.

Europe has recently experienced a period of economic uncertainty, as have many economies across the
world. In some of the countries in which we operate, financial markets have been volatile, business and
consumer spending has declined and overall business activity has slowed. If recent market and
economic conditions persist in the countries in which we operate, particularly in Benelux and/or the rest
of Western Europe, our clients may be adversely impacted, which may have a material and adverse
effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Similarly, a worsening of these
conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on us.

**_Our inability to implement our business strategy could harm our business, growth and profitability_**
**_and in the course of implementing such strategy, particularly with regard to expansion, we may_**
**_incur unexpected costs and other material issues._**

Our profitability and growth depends on the successful implementation of our business strategy. If we do
not achieve our strategic objectives, whether due to changes in the industry in which we operate
(including but not due to legal and regulatory changes) or otherwise, our profitability and growth may be
materially impaired.

Our significant strategic objective since our inception has been international growth, with our recent
growth focused on developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Norway and Indonesia.
Our successful international growth in recent years has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a
significant strain on management and resources (financial or otherwise). Continued growth may require
corresponding investments in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial
and management systems and controls. Failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to our
systems and infrastructure and to maintain our client service levels could lead to failures, delays in our
provision of service to clients and reputational harm. This could in turn result in a loss of clients or a
reduction in the growth of our client base, increased operating expenses, financial losses, litigation or
client claims, and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens causing operating margins and
profitability to be materially adversely affected. Our current business model may not be successful in any
new markets that we may target.

**_We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or realize the benefits we_**
**_anticipate from any acquisition._**

Since our formation in 1988, we have grown significantly through acquisitions and organic growth. We
may in the future, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, acquire businesses that we believe
are strategically beneficial, and any acquisition targets may be significant. We may not be able to
complete any acquisition or business arrangement that we pursue, or are pursuing, on favorable terms,
if at all, and any acquisitions or business arrangements may not ultimately benefit our business.

Any acquisitions, if consummated, might require us to incur substantial indebtedness or raise additional
equity financing. We cannot assure investors that, with respect to our recent acquisitions or future
acquisitions, we will:

- realize all or any of the anticipated benefits;

- successfully integrate the businesses with our operations; or

- manage such integration without adversely affecting our existing operations.

Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including the Target, may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, such
acquisitions may divert significant management resources required to address such integration issues.
Furthermore, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in such integration or may be subject to

25


-----

material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition. Any of these
issues may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We depend on our senior management team, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel_**
**_and/or hire additional personnel, our ability to implement our growth strategy and compete in our_**
**_industry could be harmed._**

Our future growth and success depends, in part, upon the leadership and performance of our highly
skilled management team, many of whom have significant experience in the corporate services sector
and would be difficult to replace. The loss of key employees or the inability to attract and retain highly
skilled and qualified personnel could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, the loss of
other executive officers or key employees, the inability to recruit sufficient, qualified personnel, or the
inability to replace departing employees in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to run our business and, accordingly, on our financial condition and operating results.

Competition in our industry for suitably qualified senior managers is intense. If we lose the services of
any of our senior management team or other key personnel, we may have to incur significant costs in
identifying, hiring, training and retaining replacements for departing employees. In addition, significant
losses of key personnel, particularly to our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results.

**_We have exposure to liability or loss of business based on the actions of our employees_**
**_(particularly where they are acting as directors for client entities or structures and in connection_**
**_with providing trustee services) our joint venture partners, co-owners, Group members and_**
**_sub-contractors._**

Our business operates with several thousand employees in 82 different jurisdictions, each with different
laws, practices, standards and regulations. We have training and work guidelines in place, but we
cannot exclude the risk that our employees may behave in such a way that we are exposed to risk or
would have to defend ourselves based on the actions of an employee. We may also suffer reputational
harm should an employee act inappropriately while representing us. We have a number of joint ventures
(formal and informal) where we are reliant upon our joint venture partners complying with the terms of
our agreements and our Group policies and procedures. If they fail to comply with these agreements
and procedures or otherwise act in a manner that may harm our reputation or expose us to liability, this
could have a significant impact on our reputation and financial condition. Also, in some jurisdictions
where for legal, regulatory or commercial reasons third parties or employees may own shares in a Group
member, we are particularly exposed to acts of such third parties or employees that may have a
significant impact on the Group if they do not comply with the terms of their employment and other
agreements and may cause us to lose business (and/or it may take some time for alternative
arrangements to be put in place in order for the Group to continue our normal operations, particularly if
any such employee does not leave the Group on amicable terms). In addition, we work with and rely on
third-party sub-contractors in some instances (typically, where we enter into master service agreements
to provide client services in jurisdictions in which we do not have an office) who could also harm our
reputation or expose us to liability should they fail to fulfil their obligations or act inappropriately. Should
these risks materialize, our reputation and possibly our financial condition would be negatively
impacted.

As part of our business, our employees may act as directors of corporate entities of our clients, including
entities formed to administer significant investments. We have in the past been subject to claims based
upon the actions of our employees when acting in this capacity, and we generally agree to indemnify our
employees for claims against them in this capacity. Accordingly, actions of our employees, particularly
when acting as directors of corporate entities or structures of clients, could expose us to significant
liability.

**_We are dependent on our local employees and our local operations are subject to high turnover_**
**_rates; any increase in employee turnover may have a material and adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial conditions and results of operations._**

We are dependent on our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified employees. The corporate services
industry, by its nature, is labor intensive and experiences a high employee turnover rate. There is always

26


-----

a risk of losing current employees not only to our direct outsourcing competition, but also to other
businesses who may provide only a small component of our services, for example law, consulting or
accounting firms. A higher turnover rate among our employees would increase our recruiting and
training costs and could require us to offer higher wages, thus increasing costs and could materially
adversely impact the quality of services we provide to our clients. If we are unable to recruit and retain a
sufficient number of qualified employees, we would be forced to limit our growth or possibly curtail our
operations. Growth in our business will require us to recruit and train qualified personnel at an
accelerated rate from time to time. We may not be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient
number of qualified employees to meet the needs of our business or to support our growth. If we are
unable to do so, our business could be harmed. In addition, any increase in wage costs, costs of
employee benefits or employment taxes may have a material and adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In jurisdictions where we have relatively small operations that clients deal with on a very regular basis,
there is also a risk that key employees in those jurisdictions could leave and take certain clients or work
with them to competitors.

**_If we fail to fully establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able_**
**_to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or make well-informed decisions._**

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and
effectively reduce the risk of fraud. An important part of our growth strategy has been, and will likely
continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and
controls to become increasingly complex as our business grows and to the extent we make future
acquisitions. Likewise, the complexity of our transactions, systems and controls may make our business
more difficult to manage. Additional complexity arises for our control environment from the fact that we
operate in numerous countries across the world, in many of which our local staff is small. We cannot be
certain that the measures we have taken will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate
controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new
or improved controls, difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, or difficulties in the
assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause
us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause
investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on
our future access to capital. Any ineffective procedures or controls may also provide management with
inaccurate information, reducing management’s ability to make informed decisions or respond
effectively to material issues.

**_Any significant changes in our competitive business environment may affect our ability to compete_**
**_effectively for current and potential clients, and consequently our results of operations and_**
**_financial condition may be adversely affected._**

On a regional and country level, we may face increased competition from our local or regional
competitors in relation to certain services they offer, particularly if there is further consolidation of
regional and/or local markets and because some competitors have very long standing relationships with
clients and persons who serve as references for new work. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to compete successfully against future competitors or that competitive pressures it faces will not
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any increase in
competition generally or as a result of consolidation in the market by medium size competitors and/or
regional competitors may have a significant adverse effect on our business and future prospects.

**_We may not be able to expand into a particular jurisdiction required by current or potential clients._**

Given the nature of our business, regulatory and/or tax changes can lead to demand for client services in
jurisdictions where we have not historically operated. If such demand were to occur in the future, there
may be regulatory, competition and practical constraints that could prevent us from establishing an
office in such a jurisdiction to meet client demand (or, at the very least, as quickly as we would like). Such
inability or delay could result in a loss of current or potential business.

27


-----

**_Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to retain our existing clients, provide_**
**_additional services to our existing clients, introduce new or enhanced services and attract and_**
**_retain new clients._**

Our revenue and revenue growth are dependent on our ability to retain clients, sell them additional
services, introduce new services and attract new clients in each of our businesses. Our ability to increase
revenue will depend on a variety of factors, including:

- the quality and perceived value of our service offerings by existing and new clients;

- effective sales and marketing efforts;

- the level of market acceptance of new services;

- actions or reactions of our competitors;

- reputation and local press reporting;

- client willingness to accept any price increases;

- our ability to integrate technology into our services to avoid obsolescence and provide scalability;

- the successful implementation of services for new and existing clients;

- the regulatory needs and requirements facing us and our clients; and

- our ability to meet increased client regulatory requirements.

Our inability to retain existing clients or successfully develop and implement new and enhanced services
and attract new clients or could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We generate a relatively large share of our revenue in Benelux and any significant change in client_**
**_demand for our services in Benelux could have a significant adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition and prospects._**

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated 31.7% of our consolidated revenue in Benelux.
Thus, we are more exposed to significant movements in client demand in Benelux than in other
jurisdictions. Decreased Benelux demand could result from, for example, (i) a reduction in foreign direct
investment, (ii) adverse double tax treaty amendments, (iii) a significant deterioration in our reputation,
(iv) regulatory changes or sanctions, and (v) any of the other risks noted in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section
that have an impact on Benelux. A decline in business in the Benelux region as a result of any of the
forgoing factors could have a significant adverse effect on our business.

**_A significant reduction in foreign direct investment could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business._**

Our existing and potential clients include foreign companies expanding into new geographies. The
general global level of foreign direct investment therefore has a significant impact on demand for our
services. Foreign direct investment can be driven by a large number of macro-economic and jurisdiction
specific factors, including local regulatory regimes, exchange controls, government’s taking local
protectionist actions and/or the unfavorable amendment of a jurisdiction’s double tax treaty network.
Any such reduction in the level of foreign direct investment could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A significant change in the regulation of our clients, particularly any change in regulation that_**
**_adversely effects offshore funds or unfavorable amendments to double tax treaty networks_**
**_(particularly in Benelux), may have a material adverse effect on our business._**

A large number of our clients invest through tax efficient holding structures in jurisdictions that have
strong double tax treaty networks and relatively stable corporate law frameworks. If actions were taken
by regulators or government agencies that made any of these jurisdictions less attractive (particularly if
such actions effected the tax laws relating to the treatment of offshore funds), our business may be
adversely affected.

For example, a large portion of our revenue is generated from services provided in Benelux because it is
perceived as a tax efficient jurisdiction for many holding and finance company structures, partly due to

28


-----

the double tax treaty network of Benelux jurisdictions with other countries across the world. If changes
were made to these double tax treaties (or other amendments to the corporate laws) that made these
jurisdictions less attractive for holding and financial structures, this could have a material adverse effect
on our business as demand for our services in these jurisdictions could decrease significantly. In such a
case, affected clients may use our services to move their investment structures to another tax
jurisdiction. However, there is no assurance this would be the case, and there may be a net reduction in
the demand for our services, a net reduction in profitability due to demand shifting to jurisdictions that
may have a different EBITDA margin/profitability profile or we may simply lose clients to competitors who
have more established presences in other jurisdictions. Also, as discussed under ‘‘Risks Relating to
_Regulatory and Legislation Frameworks in which We Operate,’’ there may be regulatory, administrative or_
other hurdles to providing our services in any such new jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to local business risks in the countries in which we operate._**

We provide our services to clients through various subsidiaries and operating divisions in 82 different
jurisdictions. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social
and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in
international operations include the following:

- differences and changes in regulatory environments;

- difficulties obtaining permits and governmental approvals;

- we may provide services or undertake activities in a jurisdiction without all of the requisite regulatory
consents or permissions, exposing us to fines and sanctions;

- exposure to different legal standards;

- staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

- exposure to political risk;

- various countries may impose or increase withholding taxes or otherwise tax our income, impose
tariffs or adopt other restrictions on trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;

- fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect the profitability in euro of services provided by
us in markets where payments for our services are made in the local currency;

- general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on
our earnings from operations in those countries;

- difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables, especially in emerging markets; and

- rapid changes in market conditions in emerging markets, including changes on account of
economic or social instability or other developments not typical in non-emerging economies.

Our overall success as a multi-national business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing
legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We cannot assure investors that we will
succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location
where we operate. Accordingly, any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Exchange control restrictions or other restrictions regarding the repatriation of funds from certain_**
**_countries in which we operate (including regulatory capital restrictions) could hinder our ability to_**
**_make foreign investments, procure foreign denominated financings and extract dividends from our_**
**_operating subsidiaries._**

Exchange control regulations and restrictions regarding the repatriation of funds may restrict business
transactions between residents of certain countries in which we operate and non-residents of such
countries. For example, our subsidiaries in a particular country may (i) generally not be permitted to
export capital, hold foreign currency in excess of certain limits or incur indebtedness denominated in
foreign currencies without the approval of the local authorities; (ii) be prohibited from using transfer
pricing and excessive interest rates on foreign loans as a means of expatriating currency; or
(iii) generally not be permitted to acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of the local
authorities or be subject to compliance with the investment criteria of such local authorities.

29


-----

It is difficult to predict what action, if any, governments may take in the future with respect to exchange
controls and similar restrictions. If governments of countries where we do business were to tighten
controls, these restrictions could hinder our ability to make foreign currency denominated investments
and procure foreign currency denominated financings in the future, pay dividends from our subsidiaries,
or pay interest expense on our debt (including the Notes) using our cash from our operating subsidiaries
in such countries.

Additionally, as discussed in ‘‘Regulation,’’ we are required to maintain a specified level of regulatory
capital in certain of the jurisdictions in which we are regulated. An increase in such requirements would
decrease the amount of cash subsidiaries in such jurisdictions would be able to distribute to other
subsidiaries or the Issuer, which could adversely affect cash available for payment on the Notes.

**_Information technology (‘‘IT’’) connectivity is important to our ability to provide integrated services_**
**_across our global network and a loss of such connectivity could have a significant effect on us._**

We rely on information technology to ensure that our global network of 116 offices in 82 jurisdictions
remains connected in order to provide an integrated service to our clients across jurisdictions. The
quality and level of information technology infrastructure varies across the Group based on, among
other things, the size of our offices, IT providers, levels of historical investment in IT and number of
employees in a particular office. If one or more events leads to a loss of connectivity across offices, this
may have a significant effect on our ability to service the needs of our clients, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_Wage increases may reduce our profit margin._**

Salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees are among our most significant
costs. For example, in 2013 our wage and salary costs increased and had an impact on operating profit.
See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Wages
_and Salaries.’’ Wage, salary and related benefit increases can have a significant impact on our operating_
profits and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.

**_We rely on certain single source information technology products from suppliers that are relatively_**
**_small and have limited support services._**

We rely heavily on a number of software programs that we have licensed from relatively small
companies. To the extent that significant issues develop with these software programs, we may
experience issues seeking appropriate levels of support to rectify such issues in a speedy manner, and
this could significantly impact our ability to provide services to our clients. This would be a particular risk
to our corporate and fund administration services that greatly rely on these programs.

**_Our clients may for various reasons seek to conduct the services we provide in-house, which_**
**_would lead to significant decrease in the demand for our services._**

Clients who currently use us to fulfil certain function and provide business services may for various
reasons seek to bring back in-house certain of those services—for example, clients may establish
sufficiently large operations in a jurisdiction to which they have expanded and want those functions
carried out in-house. If this was to occur, it could lead to a significant decline in demand for our services.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS IN WHICH WE**
**OPERATE**

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which may increase our_**
**_costs and otherwise adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision. Such governmental regulation and
supervision, as well as future changes in laws, regulations or government policy (or in the interpretation
of existing laws or regulations) that affect us, our competitors or our industry, generally strongly influence
how we operate our business. Adverse regulatory developments could expose our business to a
number of risks. Regulation could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered
and could lead to increased operating costs and capital expenditure. See ‘‘Regulation.’’ In particular, we
are subject to rules regarding licensing, authorizations, and other regulatory permits and data protection
laws. Complying with existing regulations is burdensome, and future changes may increase our
operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues.

**_Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data and/or data protected by data protection laws_**
**_could result in liability and harm our reputation._**

As part of our service offerings, we handle and process increasingly large amounts of potentially
sensitive or confidential information of our clients, much of which is protected by data protection laws.
While we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business
groups and geographies, it is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of
employees and partners on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper
disclosure of such sensitive information in breach of applicable laws and contracts. Improper disclosure
of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to us and our clients, result in
investigations and/or fines from local regulators or subject us to liability under laws that protect data,
resulting in increased costs and/or loss of revenue. Perceptions that our services do not adequately
protect the privacy of client information could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operation.

**_Our operations and future growth may be affected by competition regulations._**

We are subject to competition laws and regulations at the national and supranational level. Where we
have a leading market position, these laws and regulations may reduce our operational flexibility and
limit our ability to make additional acquisitions and implement our strategy. Individual local managers
may act against our instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable competition
laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with
competitors regarding markets or clients. Such actions may harm our reputation and, if we are held
responsible, the resulting fines and other sanctions could be substantial. Thus, the occurrence of any
such incidents may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Co-owner, subcontractor, joint venture partner, employee, and/or regional management_**
**_misconduct or failure to comply with various laws, regulations and Group policies and procedures_**
**_could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and_**
**_profits and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions._**

We delegate considerable operational responsibility to our subsidiaries and rely upon joint venture
partners, co-owners, and subcontractors in certain jurisdictions. We may experience incidents of (i) our
local, regional and national managers, and employees and (ii) to the extent they are required to, our joint
venture partners, co-owners and subcontractors, not complying with our policies, making unintended
accounting misstatements or breaches of local and national regulations and legislation. Any of these
potential issues could, individually or collectively, have a material adverse effect on our cash flows,
financial condition and results of operations as a result of the potential consequences, including
litigation, regulatory consequences and/or reputational damage.

**_Failure of our ‘‘know your customer’’ controls could result in our representation of a client that may_**
**_subject us to material legal claims or sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on us_**
**_and our reputation._**

Our ‘‘know your customer’’ oversight function is supervised by our dedicated KYC team in Switzerland,
but part of the operational function is carried out by local compliance officers around our network.
Although we have policies and procedure in place, if a significant quality control issue or fraud in the
checking of our clients occurs, we may be exposed to significant legal and reputation risk, as well as
investigations and fines from local regulators. This risk and any resulting penalties could be substantial,
particularly if we engage with one or more clients that are on U.S. or United Nations sanction lists or
blacklists, such as sanctioned clients in Russia and Ukraine (two countries in which we have operations),
and/or clients whose ultimate beneficial owners are associated with undesirable or criminal activities.

**_Deliberate, malicious or criminal acts, including fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption,_**
**_may materially adversely affect our business and reputation._**

We face a number of risks from deliberate, malicious or criminal acts, including fraud, bribery and
corruption by clients or employees. We are reliant on our internal control environment, including our
internal financial controls and accounting systems, to provide us with reasonable assurance that the
company’s operations are proceeding as intended and transactions are appropriately recorded. Should

31


-----

any or all of these controls, processes, procedures and systems fail to operate as intended or expected,
this may affect our potential revenues and accuracy of our books and records.

We face the risk of fraud, which can be perpetrated by employees or external parties, and the scale of the
possible financial consequences may be significant. The steps we have taken to mitigate the risks of
fraud and other criminal acts may not be adequate.

In addition, we operate and conduct business in markets which have experienced business corruption
and related criminal activity, and are susceptible to corruption on the part of government officials or
employees. Although our internal policies and procedures mandate strict compliance with applicable
laws prohibiting corrupt payments to other businesses, officials or employees or other persons, that
such internal policies and procedures may not be adhered to by our employees. Findings against us,
our directors, officers or employees, or involvement in corruption or other illegal activity could result in
criminal or civil penalties, including substantial monetary fines or could affect our regulatory status. Any
government investigations or other allegations against us, our directors, officers or employees, or
findings of involvement in corruption or other illegal activity by such persons, could significantly damage
our reputation and our ability to do business, and could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR TAX POSITION**

**_Our exposure to several tax jurisdictions may have an adverse effect on us._**

Although a substantial part of our operations are located in the Netherlands, we are subject to the tax
laws of numerous jurisdictions. Generally, the Issuer and/or any of its subsidiaries may be subject to tax
in jurisdictions other than their places of incorporation, for example through being considered tax
resident or by being considered to be trading in that jurisdiction through a permanent establishment.
The combined effect of the application of tax laws, including the application or disapplication of tax
treaties concluded by the relevant countries, of one or more of these jurisdictions and/or their
interpretation by the relevant tax authorities could, under certain circumstances, produce contradictory
results and related tax liabilities for us, and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and operating results.

**_We are subject to risks in connection with the tax positions taken in the course of our business._**

We take positions in the course of our business with respect to various tax matters (acting reasonably
and based on the information available to us), including, but not limited to, the taxation of foreign
exchange results, compliance with the arm’s length principles in respect of transactions with related
parties, the tax deductibility of interest and other costs and the amount of depreciation or write-down on
our assets that we can recognize for tax purposes. There is no assurance that the tax authorities in the
Netherlands or any other jurisdiction will agree with the positions taken by us. In the event the tax
authorities disagree with us on any of our positions, we may be subject to an unexpected tax liability that
may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

**_Tax rules limiting the deductibility of interest expenses could reduce our net income._**

We incur a substantial amount of interest expense on our Revolving Credit Facility and Notes (and have
incurred a substantial amount of interest expense under our previous finance structures). In addition,
some of our subsidiaries will obtain inter-company financing and record interest expense on such
financing. To the extent our interest expenses are not deductible for any reason (including the other risks
highlighted under ‘‘Risks Relating to Our Tax Position’’), we may incur a reduction of our existing loss
carry forwards and we may pay higher taxes. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.

**_If the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be_**
**_inappropriate, our tax liability may increase._**

We have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our
business, including loans and certain service functions. The Netherlands’ transfer pricing regulations, as
well as regulations applicable in other countries in which we operate, require that any international
transaction involving associate enterprises be at arm’s-length terms. If a tax authority in any jurisdiction
reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the prices and/or other terms we have applied in

32


-----

relation to such arrangements are not in accordance with the relevant transfer pricing rules, or that other
income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction, we may incur increased tax liability, including
accrued interest and penalties, which would cause our tax expense to increase, possibly materially,
thereby reducing our profitability and cash flow.

**_Adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on us._**

The tax laws and regulations in the Netherlands and other jurisdictions in which we operate may be
subject to change, and there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of such tax law or
regulation. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws or
regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. This or any future audit may
require us to pay additional taxes (and any accrued interest and penalties). We regularly consider the
likelihood of assessments and have established tax allowances which represent management’s best
estimate of the potential assessments. The resolution of any of these tax matters could differ from the
amount reserved, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial
condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.

In addition, tax authorities in the Netherlands (and other jurisdictions) periodically examine us and our
subsidiaries. Tax audits will include a review of interest deductibility, the Group’s transfer pricing
arrangements, the Group’s fiscal unity, the taxation of foreign exchange results and the amount of
depreciation or write-down of our assets that we recognize for tax purposes. On-going tax audits or tax
audits for periods not yet reviewed may lead to higher tax assessments. Any additional taxes or other
sums that become due could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Termination or adverse amendment of double tax treaties currently relied upon by us in managing_**
**_our tax affairs._**

Our tax affairs rely on the terms of numerous double tax treaties. If any such tax treaty were terminated or
amended, there is a risk that we could be exposed to tax liabilities that are materially adverse to our
business and financial condition.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes._**

We have incurred a substantial amount of consolidated debt. As of March 31, 2014, after giving pro
forma effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes and the application of the net proceeds as described
under ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ our total consolidated third-party debt (which excludes Subordinated
Shareholder Funding) would have been e673.1 million.

The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to holders of the Additional
Notes, including, but not limited to:

- limiting our ability to obtain additional funding for future capital expenditures, working capital
requirements, debt service requirements, acquisitions, joint ventures and other general corporate
purposes;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, joint ventures and other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in
which we operate;

- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in economic conditions generally;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including those with respect to the
Notes.

33


-----

**_To make payments on the Existing Notes and Additional Notes and to service our other debt, we will_**
**_require a significant amount of cash, which we may not be able to raise or generate. Our ability to_**
**_generate cash and the amount of cash generated depends on a number of factors, some of which_**
**_are beyond our control._**

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to make payments of interest and
principal on, or to refinance, our debt (including the Notes), or to fund planned capital expenditures and
working capital, will depend on our future operating performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to
general economic, financial, legislative, regulatory, competitive and other factors that are beyond our
control. In the future, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable it to
service our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash, we might adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing all or a portion of our debt,
selling assets or obtaining additional equity capital. In the alternative, we may also be forced to:

- reduce our business activities or delay capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

These strategies might not be implemented on satisfactory terms or without substantial additional
expense to us, if at all. In particular, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the RCF, limit, and any
future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the
satisfaction of the covenants in our credit facilities, including the RCF, and our other debt agreements,
including the Indentures, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need
to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. We cannot assure you that our
business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to
us under our existing or new credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to
pay our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to
comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition,
any failure to raise additional funds necessary to service our debt on a timely basis could result in a
default under our debt, including any or all of the RCF or the Notes. This in turn would also likely result in
a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional debt.

**_Restrictive covenants in the RCF and the Indentures governing the Notes may restrict our ability to_**
**_operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of events_**
**_beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

The Indentures and the RCF contain, among other things, certain provisions which may restrict our
ability to:

- incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends and other distributions, with respect to outstanding
share capital;

- repay or redeem subordinated debt or share capital;

- create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts from subsidiaries of the Issuer;

- make certain investments;

- issue or sell share capital or assets of subsidiaries of the Issuer;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- expand into unrelated businesses;

34


-----

- in regards to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, impair the security interest for the benefit of the
holders; and

- effect a merger or consolidation of, or sell all or substantially all of our assets or all of the assets of
the subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All of these limitations are subject to exceptions and qualifications which may be important. In addition,
under the RCF, we must maintain a specified finance ratio (calculated as the ratio of consolidated total
net debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the 12 month period ending on the calculation date).
Events beyond our control could impact our ability to meet any such ratios and, if we fail to meet such
ratios, we will be precluded from borrowing under the RCF and a default thereunder would occur.

The covenants in each Indenture, the RCF and any future debt may significantly restrict our future
operations and our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business
opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance
our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or
finance our capital needs. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the RCF or
any other debt of ours, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together
with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the
lenders could proceed against the Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. If
the lenders accelerate the payment of those amounts, our assets pledged as Collateral may not be
sufficient to repay in full those amounts, or to satisfy all of our other liabilities.

**_Despite our current level of debt, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to_**
**_operate our businesses._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the RCF
and the Indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are
subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the
amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial and we
may be able to secure such additional debt with Collateral or other assets. If new debt is added to our
and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition,
the Indentures and the RCF do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt
under those agreements.

**_We are exposed to currency fluctuation risks as well as to other international business risks that_**
**_could adversely affect our results of operations._**

We currently conduct our business operations across multiple jurisdictions, including, among others,
the European Union, North and South America, China, Russia and Australia. Our business is subject to
risks normally associated with international operations, including currency fluctuation risks. Our results
of operations may be affected by translation effects, and, to a more limited extent, transaction effects of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In particular, our subsidiaries report their financial condition
and results of operations in their currency, which are then translated into euro at the applicable exchange
rates for inclusion in our financial statements. Thus, our financial results in any given period may be
affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to various local currencies, adversely affecting
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We reported losses in each of our financial periods reported in this Offering Memorandum and may_**
**_report losses in future periods._**

We reported losses of e74.2 million, e42.3 million, e31.7 million, e10.1 million and e6.6 million in the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014,
respectively. These losses were the result of our financial performance in each period, in particular the
finance expenses associated with our indebtedness outstanding in each period, as described in
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’ We may
report losses in future periods.

35


-----

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES**

**_Each of the RCF and the Senior Secured Notes bears interest at a floating rate that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing our cash flow._**

Each of the RCF and the Senior Secured Notes bears interest at floating rates of interest per annum
equal to EURIBOR, adjusted quarterly, plus a spread. EURIBOR could rise significantly in the future.
Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of
these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant
amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly our interest expense associated with the RCF and the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent
not hedged, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer, most of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside of the United
States. All of the directors of the Issuer and the Guarantors will be non-residents of the United States and
all or a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible
for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their
respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure
investors that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be
enforceable in the Netherlands.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the
Netherlands. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in the Netherlands of civil liabilities based
upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in the Netherlands. In addition, the
enforcement in the Netherlands of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.
For further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgment.’’

**_Fraudulent conveyance and other laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**
**_Additional Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral._**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy (the _actio pauliana provisions). The_ _actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection_
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitation, an agreement which guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees
to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, entering into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be
challenged in or outside of the bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the receiver in
bankruptcy in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person
outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (‘‘onverplicht’’);
(ii) the relevant creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at
the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (‘‘om niet’’), in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not required for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent
conveyance. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Additional Notes or any payment under them
involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance
of the Additional Notes and any payment under them could be nullified. As a result of such successful
challenges, holders of the Additional Notes may not be able to enjoy the benefit of the Additional Notes,
and the value of any consideration that holders of the Additional Notes received with respect to the
Additional Notes could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Additional Notes and,
possibly, from any subsequent transferees the Additional Notes. In addition, under such circumstances,
holders of the Additional Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by our prejudiced
creditors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

36


-----

**_Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_**
**_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes are, and under the Additional Senior
Secured Notes, will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and secured by the
Collateral. The Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Senior Notes are, and under the Additional Senior
Notes will be, guaranteed by the Senior Notes Guarantees. The Notes and Guarantees and Collateral
may be subject to claims that they should be limited or subordinated in favor of the Issuer’s existing and
future creditors under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, the
Netherlands, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these
jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or
benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges,
financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and
defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee
depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. In addition, limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the granting of the Guarantees (and
the granting of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees) may be subject to legal challenge and review under fraudulent transfer and conveyance
laws or other laws that have been enacted for the protection of creditors in the United States and the
Netherlands. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.’’

These laws, among other things, could limit the ability of an entity to guarantee and secure the debt of a
related entity. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance
laws, a court could subordinate or a court, a receiver in bankruptcy, or a creditor could void a Guarantee
or the security interests in respect thereof or third-party debt if it found that the Guarantor granting such
Guarantee:

- knew or should have known that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors;

- intended to hinder, delay or defraud creditors; or

- did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring such debt and such
Guarantor (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because it incurred such debt, (ii) was engaged or
about to engage in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its
ability to pay them as they mature.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws varies, depending on the law applied.
Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

- the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

- it could not or would not pay its debts as they become due.

If a court, a receiver in bankruptcy, or a creditor were to find that the granting of a Guarantee (or the
granting of the security interests associated with the Senior Secured Notes) was a fraudulent
conveyance, the court or a creditor could void or declare unenforceable the payment obligations under
such Guarantee or invalidate the security interests, or subordinate such Guarantee or security interest to
presently existing and future debt of such Guarantor or require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay
any amounts received with respect to such Guarantee or security interest. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity
_and Enforcement of the Guarantees and Security Interests.’’_

**_Corporate benefit and other limitations under Dutch corporate law may affect the validity and_**
**_enforceability of the Notes._**

Under Dutch law, the validity and enforceability of the Notes may, in whole or in part, be affected or
limited to the extent that the obligations of the Issuer under the terms of the Notes are not within the
scope of the Issuer’s objects and the relevant counterparty was aware or ought to have been aware

37


-----

(without inquiry) of this fact. The articles of association of the Issuer permit the issuing of the Notes.
However, the determination by a court of whether issuing the Notes is within the objects of the Issuer will
also be based on factors other than the wording of the Issuer’s articles of association. Such a
determination must take into account all relevant circumstances, including the question of whether it is in
the Issuer’s interest to issue the the Notes. If it is determined that issuing the Notes has had or would
have an adverse effect on the interests of the Issuer, the issuance may be found to be voidable, or the
obligations of the Issuer under the terms of the Notes may be found to be unenforceable, upon the
request of the Issuer or its receiver in bankruptcy. As a result, notwithstanding that the Issuer’s articles of
association permit the Notes to be issued, and notwithstanding that the Issuer’s board of directors has
resolved that issuing the Notes is within the Issuer’s corporate objects and in its interest, no assurance
can be given that a court would find that the issuance of the Notes by the Issuer is indeed within its
corporate objects and in its interest. In the event that the Issuer or an administrator of the Issuer in
bankruptcy successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of the Notes, the Issuer’s obligations
under the terms of the Notes will be limited to any portion that is not nullified and remains enforceable.

**_Relevant insolvency laws in jurisdictions other than the United States may provide you with less_**
**_protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the Guarantors are incorporated under
the laws of various jurisdictions, including the laws of the British Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom,
Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests’’ for a description of the insolvency laws in the British Virgin_
Islands, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands, which could limit the
enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees and
Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering Memorandum are
also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of
the Guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be
subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions.
The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest
and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call
into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts
that you may receive.

**_The Issuer is a holding company and is completely dependent on cash flow from its operating_**
**_subsidiaries to service its debt, including the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets outside
of its shares in its subsidiaries and cash in its bank accounts. The Issuer has no revenue generating
operations of its own, and therefore the Issuer’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the
Notes, will depend primarily on the operating performance and financial condition of its operating
subsidiaries. The operating performance and financial condition of the operating subsidiaries of the
Issuer and the ability of such subsidiaries to provide funds to the Issuer by way of dividends or otherwise
will in turn depend, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other
factors, many of which are beyond the Issuer’s control. The subsidiaries of the Issuer may not generate
income and cash flow sufficient to enable the Issuer to meet its payment obligations on the Notes.

Various regulations and current/future agreements governing certain of our subsidiaries may restrict,
and in some cases, actually prohibit the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted
group. Applicable laws and regulations including local accounting regulations, tax laws, foreign
exchange controls and regulatory capital requirements may also limit the amounts that the subsidiaries
of the Issuer are permitted to pay as dividends or distributions. Any restrictions on distributions by such
subsidiaries could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes. In addition,
financial assistance restrictions may prevent upstream loans being made to the Issuer by its subsidiaries
to enable the Issuer to service its obligations under the Notes. Although the Indentures limit the ability of

38


-----

the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and
make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these
limitations.

Goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our consolidated income statement, as well as
charges recognized directly in equity, such as actuarial losses, foreign exchange rate adjustments and
losses on hedges, if incurred, could potentially reduce the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ reserves available for
distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments to the Issuer.

We believe that our expected cash flows, together with available borrowings, will be sufficient to service
our debt, including the Notes. We expect, however, that we will be required to make additional
borrowings in order to repay the Notes at their maturity. There can be no assurance that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the
Notes, when due or to fund other liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other
capital resources are insufficient for us to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may, among other things, be forced to:

- reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital;

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity; or

- forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

There can be no assurance that any of these alternatives can be accomplished on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing and future debt, including the Indentures
and the RCF, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_The Notes and each of the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities_**
**_of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of the Issuer’s subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor
subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its
parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or
bankruptcy proceeding of any of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt and their
trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries
before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each
Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and
preference shareholders (if any) of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries. The covenants in the Notes
permit it to incur additional debt at subsidiaries which do not guarantee the Notes and in the future the
revenues and EBITDA of such entities could increase, possibly substantially. As of March 31, 2014, the
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors would have had e9.6 million of indebtedness and
e65.9 million of trade payables and other liabilities outstanding, excluding the provisions, retirement
benefit obligations and FIT liabilities.

**_Your ability to recover under the Collateral may be limited. Before any amounts are available to_**
**_repay the Senior Secured Notes, lenders under the RCF and certain hedge counterparties will have_**
**_a right to be repaid with the proceeds realized following the enforcement of all or part of the_**
**_Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees are secured
by security interests over the Collateral granted to secure obligations under the RCF and certain of our
hedging obligations. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the RCF and certain
hedge counterparties will have priority over the holders of Senior Secured Notes with respect to the
proceeds from this Collateral. In addition, the creditors under the RCF and certain hedge counterparties
will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of any assets of the Issuer or any of the
Guarantors pursuant to an insolvency event or from any judicial supervised or sanctioned reorganization
or administrative work-out or restructuring. As such, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if
the claims of the lenders under the RCF and certain hedge counterparties under our hedging obligations

39


-----

are greater than the proceeds realized from any enforcement of the Collateral. Any proceeds from the
enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the RCF and certain
hedging obligations in relation thereto have been paid from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in
repayment of the Senior Secured Notes and any other such secured obligations. Subject to certain
conditions, any security interest in the Collateral will be automatically released at the time of an
enforcement sale of the pledged entity or of the pledged assets or shares of any direct or indirect parent
entity of such subsidiary. Following such a sale, the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
will have no claims in relation to such entity and its direct and indirect subsidiaries under the Senior
Secured Notes or any Guarantee.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees are secured by security interests in
the Collateral as described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations
under the RCF. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the
Indentures, the RCF, and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any
increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral to a reduction securing the Senior Secured
Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon enforcement of such Collateral will
depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the availability of buyers and whether approvals
required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of
any Collateral, the lenders under the RCF, certain hedge counterparties and holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part, because
most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than
their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, there
may be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured
Notes and the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by such
Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding-up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s
shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been
pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the
case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Notes on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes. To the extent that holders of
other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, such holders or third parties may
have rights and remedies with respect to the Issuer’s shares that, if exercised, could reduce the
proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior
Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such additional Senior Secured
Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes being
offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the Collateral for such Senior Secured Notes.

**_The rights of the Senior Secured Notes to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral are_**
**_subject to Collateral sharing arrangements._**

The security interest in our assets serving as Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Note Guarantees thereof will also be granted as Collateral in favor of the lenders under the RCF
and certain hedging counterparties. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture also permit a security interest in such Collateral to be granted to lenders of additional debt and
to hedging counterparties under certain of our hedging obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement

40


-----

provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the Security Agent for the lenders under
the RCF, certain hedge counterparties and any additional secured debt, will act only as provided for in
the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the lenders and the agent under the RCF and the
representatives of our hedging counterparties and any security agent with respect to any future secured
debt will have, subject to prior notification of and consultation with the Trustee, the right to instruct the
Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
not be able to force a sale of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise
independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the security documents without
consulting the lenders under the RCF, certain hedge counterparties and any such other secured debt for
so long as any amounts under the RCF, certain hedging obligations or such other secured debt remain
outstanding or as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any
other debt secured by such Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to
maximize the secured creditors’ recovery from an enforcement sale. Prior to enforcement of the
Collateral by another class of creditors, the Security Agent will be provided with notice and the right to
consult. Neither the Security Agent nor the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have the ability to
prevent or delay enforcement after the relevant consultation periods have expired. The lenders under the
RCF, certain hedge counterparties or any other future class of debt secured by the Collateral may have
interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may elect to
pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would not be advantageous for the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so.

In addition, if the agent under the RCF, the representatives of our hedging counterparties and any agent
with respect to any future secured debt has instructed the security agent to sell either some or all of our
subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent entity of such subsidiary or other assets through an
enforcement of their security interests in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
Senior Secured Note Guarantees from any such Senior Secured Note Guarantor that is sold and any
Senior Secured Note Guarantee issued and the security over any such assets securing the Senior
Secured Notes and any Senior Secured Note Guarantee thereof will be automatically released. See
‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreements.’’

**_The security over the Collateral has not been granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secures the Group’s obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes and the obligations of the Senior Secured Note Guarantors under the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees have not been granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, but have been
granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes has entered into
the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Agent and representatives of the other debt
secured by the Collateral, including the RCF and counterparties to certain hedging obligations. Other
creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the
Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing in any
recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. As a
consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes,
except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth under the caption
‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ In addition, in certain circumstances,
lenders under the RCF will have the right to direct the Security Agent in enforcement actions with respect
to the Collateral.

**_The Issuer and the Senior Secured Note Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the_**
**_sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The security documents will allow the Issuer and the Senior Secured Note Guarantors to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the
Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would
result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes may, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
such Collateral, such as selling, factoring or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary
course cash payments, including repayments of debt.

41


-----

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority
security interests in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes from time to time, whether on or
after the date the Senior Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as
the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority
ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the
Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party, including that of competent regulatory
authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be
able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may
not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes have been, and the Additional Notes will be, issued by the Issuer, a company which is
organized and established under the laws of the Netherlands, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors,
which are incorporated under the laws of Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States,
the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event,
proceedings could be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in
greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes and
the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws
of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your
rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of
organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to
obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict
among them, could call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and
may adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See ‘‘Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Judgments’’ with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the
Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or
whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization.
Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not be able to avoid
foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of these
subsidiaries to guarantee debt of other companies. As a result, a court in those jurisdictions may deem
the Guarantees to not be valid, which would reduce the amount of Collateral available to satisfy claims
under the Notes. See ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.’’

**_The rights of the Security Agent to enforce security over shares of a regulated entity are subject to_**
**_prior regulatory consent in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands._**

The enforcement of a Luxembourg law governed security over, and the exercise by the Security Agent of
voting rights in respect of, at least 10% of the shares of a Luxembourg regulated entity or a non-regulated

42


-----

entity but which is the direct or indirect shareholder of a Luxembourg regulated entity, is subject to
regulatory consent by the CSSF.

In particular, the enforcement over the shares of such a relevant entity will require:

- from the pledgor of such shares, to notify or have the CSSF notified in advance of its intention to
transfer the shares as the result of the enforcement; and

- from the pledgee or transferee of such shares, to notify or have the CSSF notified in advance of its
intention to acquire the shares as the result of the enforcement, such notification including (i) the
size of the intended holding, (ii) the contemplated changes of the board of directors of the
Luxembourg regulated entity and the honorability and experience of the potential new directors,
(iii) the pledgee’s or transferee’s financial stability and honorability and (iv) the satisfaction of all
other regulatory requirements imposed under the laws and regulations of Luxembourg.

The CSSF may require during the assessment period any further information from the pledge or
transferee that is necessary to complete its assessment.

The transfer of such shares may occur if the regulatory assessment period indicated by the CSSF to the
pledgee or transferee has expired without written objection from the CSSF or if the pledgee or transferee
has received a letter of no objection from the CSSF in respect of the above.

The enforcement of a security, by way of which the Security Agent would obtain a direct or indirect
interest of at least 10% of the issued share capital or comparable interest, or the ability to directly or
indirectly exercise votes of at least 10% or a comparable control in a Dutch regulated trust office, is
subject to consent by the Dutch Central Bank (‘‘DCB’’).

Furthermore, the relevant Dutch regulated trust office must notify the DCB of any change in the de jure
and de factor control structure of the group of companies within which the trust office is an affiliate.

The information that needs to be submitted to the DCB includes, amongst others, the identity of the
person or entity directly or indirectly obtaining the Dutch Qualifying Holding in the Dutch regulated trust
office and/or the new de jure and de facto control structure of the group of companies the Dutch
regulated trust office is affiliated to. (Co-)policymakers of an entity obtaining a Dutch Qualifying Holding
in a Dutch regulated trust office will be tested by the DCB on whether they are ‘‘fit and proper’’ to act as
(co-)policymaker of the Dutch regulated trust office.

The enforcement of a security or the change to the de jure and de facto control structure of the group of
companies to which the Dutch regulated trust office is an affiliate may occur if the DCB has not raised any
objections within six weeks after it has received the relevant notifications, or after it received additional
information for which it has requested.

Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Security Agent will have to apply for the prior written
approval of the BVIFSC of its intention to acquire the shares, such notification including (i) the
contemplated changes of the board of directors of the British Virgin Islands regulated entities and the
honorability and experience of the potential new directors, (ii) the Security Agent’s financial stability and
honorability and (iii) the satisfaction of all other regulatory requirements imposed under the laws and
regulations of the British Virgin Islands.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

In certain relevant jurisdictions, under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible
assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by
the secured party or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Senior Secured Notes if we, or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. In addition, applicable
law in certain jurisdictions requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general
security interest, such as equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected
at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

43


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under_**
**_which the Collateral will be released automatically._**

The Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that the Collateral and guarantees relating to
the liabilities owed to the lenders of the RCF, the hedge counterparties and the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will be released in certain circumstances. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’,
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—The Intercreditor
_Agreements.’’ Moreover, certain proceeds received by the lenders under the RCF, hedge counterparties_
and the holders of the Notes must be turned over to the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes_**
**_upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each_**
**_Indenture._**

The Indentures contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a ‘‘change of control’’ of the
Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a ‘‘change of control,’’ the Issuer would be required to offer to repurchase
all outstanding Notes, as applicable, in each case, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the RCF, the Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual
obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in
acceleration of the RCF and other debt or trigger a similar obligation to offer to repurchase loans or
securities thereunder. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under
such debt, even if the change of control itself does not. Sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control (as defined in
the Indentures) occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited, under certain of its financing
arrangements, from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may
seek the consent of the lenders under such debt to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not
obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we
would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.
We may not be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by an Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes
would constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the RCF.
See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control.’’

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may
not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
‘‘Change of Control’’ as defined in the Indentures. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Change of Control’’, the Indentures do not contain provisions that would require the Issuer_
to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ contained in the Indentures include (with certain exceptions) a
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or
substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes and Guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of
any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption

44


-----

from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other
applicable laws. We have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the Notes or the Guarantees.
You should read the discussions in ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions’’ for further information about
these and other transfer restrictions. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes or
the Guarantees comply with applicable law.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit
rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

**_Certain covenants may fall away upon the occurrence of a change in the Group’s ratings._**

The Indentures provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indentures, the Notes receive a rating
of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P and no default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which such
Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.’’

If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, the Group would be able to incur additional debt or
make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of
the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that
any such rating will be maintained.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Additional Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns
by reference to a currency other than the euro then an investment in the Additional Notes entails foreign
exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro
relative to the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns because of
economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the
currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns could cause a decrease in the
effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the
return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure your investment
returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses from
any investment in the Notes. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—U.S. Taxation.’’

**_The Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore_**
**_you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and_**
**_remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or
holders of the Notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its nominee) will be the
sole holder of the global notes representing the Notes. After payment to the common depositary, the
Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any
rights of a holder of the Notes under the respective Indenture. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

45


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no assurance that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will
be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Additional Senior_**
**_Secured Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening_**
**_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Additional Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Note Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The
granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such
hardening periods in particular, as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the release and retaking
of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the
incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from
the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security
interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.’’

The same rights also apply in connection with the accession of additional Guarantors and the granting of
security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.’’

**_The interests of holders of the Existing Notes and the interests of the holders of the Additional_**
**_Notes may be inconsistent._**

The Additional Notes will be issued under the same indentures that govern the Existing Notes and will
vote as a single class with each of the Existing Notes, respectively, with respect to amendments, waivers
or other modifications of the Indentures other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other
modifications that will affect the Notes. For example, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a
position to agree to certain terms in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes
but adverse to the economic interest of the other series of Notes; however, to the extent the relevant
amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (subject to the limited exception described above), all holders will be bound by such amendment.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other
jurisdiction. See ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’ It is the obligation of holders of the Additional
Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Additional Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_The Notes proceeds may not be used as intended if we cannot complete the Acquisition._**

We intend to use part of the Additional Notes proceeds to fund the Acquisition. See ‘‘The Acquisition.’’
However, should we prove unable to complete the Acquisition, we intend to use such proceeds for
general corporate purposes or other business opportunities that may arise in the ordinary course of our
business. Accordingly, if we are unable to complete the Acquisition, there can be no assurance that we
will use such proceeds as described in this Offering Memorandum. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**RISKS RELATING TO THE SENIOR NOTES**

**_The Senior Note Guarantees are subordinated to certain of our existing and future senior debt._**

Each of the Senior Note Guarantees are a general senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Senior
Note Guarantor. In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Senior Note Guarantees (or any
future guarantee of the Senior Notes, if any) may be taken unless (subject to certain limited exceptions):
(i) an acceleration of the RCF (including related hedging), the Senior Secured Notes or any of our other
senior secured debt; (ii) there is a default on the Senior Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days from
that date the Revolving Facility Agent (as defined under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement’’), the Trustee or the creditor representative for holders of other senior secured_
debt delivers written notice of such default; (iii) an enforcement action has been taken with respect to
certain secured liabilities; provided that the Senior Notes Trustee and holders of the Senior Notes will be
limited to taking the same action; or (iv) with respect to any enforcement action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Notes, an insolvency event has occurred with respect to such Guarantor. Please
see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Senior Note Guarantor in liquidation, administration,
bankruptcy moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding up of such Guarantor, the holders of
senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with
respect to the Senior Note Guarantees. As a result, holders of Senior Notes may receive less, rateably,
than the holders of senior debt of the Guarantors, including the lenders under the RCF, certain hedging
counterparties and holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The claims of the holders of the Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our_**
**_existing and future secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets constituting Collateral._**

The Existing Senior Notes are, and the Additional Senior Notes will be, unsecured obligations of the
Issuer. The Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured by a firstranking share pledge over the same assets that secure the RCF and certain hedging obligations and
also benefit from pledges over shares of certain of our Spanish subsidiaries. The value of the Collateral
will not be available to pay the obligations under the Senior Notes until the obligations under the RCF,
certain hedging obligations, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and any
future debt secured by the Collateral have been satisfied. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Security.’’_

The Senior Notes Indenture provides for a negative pledge and will allow us and our restricted
subsidiaries to incur secured debt which will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes. In the event of any
distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
administration, reorganization, or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of such secured
debt will have prior claim to those of our assets that constitute their Collateral. In these circumstances,
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes. As a
result, holders of Senior Notes may receive less, rateably, than holders of secured debt.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR OWNERSHIP**

**_The interests of our principal indirect shareholders (including management in their capacity as_**
**_shareholders) may conflict with your interests._**

The shares in TMF Group Holding B.V. are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V. The shares in TMF
Group HoldCo B.V. are 100% held by TMF Orange Holding B.V. 63.24% of the ordinary shares of TMF
Orange Holding B.V. are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson. Certain of the senior management of the
Group indirectly owns 36.76% of the ordinary shares of TMF Orange Holding B.V.

The interests of TMF Orange Holding B.V.’s shareholders in certain circumstances, including
transactions that TMF Orange Holding B.V.’s shareholders believe may increase the value of their equity
holdings, may conflict with investors’ interests as holders of the Notes and may have the consequence of
increasing the financial risk of holding the Notes. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us
to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends as permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture.
Incurring additional indebtedness would increase any debt service obligations which could materially
adversely affect holders of the Notes.

Additionally, our management has certain rights under the shareholder arrangements with Doughty
Hanson that may mean their consent is required prior to our taking certain actions—these rights are, in
effect, vested in one management representative.

Further details of certain rights of Doughty Hanson and Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A.
(‘‘Middenberm’’) under the shareholders’ agreement between TMF Orange Holding B.V. and its
shareholders (and certain of their beneficial owners) (the ‘‘Orange Shareholders’ Agreement’’) are set
out under ‘‘Principal Shareholders—Orange Shareholders’ Agreement.’’

In addition, Doughty Hanson or a person affiliated with Doughty Hanson could in the future acquire and
hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.

**THE ACQUISITION**

On the Signing Date, we entered into the Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to
purchase 100% of the share capital of KCS, an independent pan-Asian corporate services provider
specializing in corporate accounting, corporate secretarial and payroll services from UCL. We expect the
Acquisition to be completed in the second half of 2014. In the event that we do not complete the
Acquisition, we intend to allocate the net proceeds to working capital and general corporate purposes,
which may include future acquisitions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

KCS is a pan-Asian corporate services provider that has approximately 470 employees throughout
14 locations in Asia Pacific, with a particularly strong presence in China. KCS provides a comprehensive
set of corporate services, consisting primarily of (i) corporate accounting and financial services,
including management accounts and other internal finance functions, outsourcing for bookkeeping and
financial control, (ii) corporate secretarial services, including company formation and secretarial
services, including the opening of bank accounts, direct appointments, share transfers, board meetings
and preparation of annual returns, (iii) payroll services, including benefits administration and processing
and (iv) other services, including private client trustee services, listing services, fund administration and
family office services.

We expect that the Acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to expand our Asia footprint,
particularly in China and more generally in East and Southeast Asia. KCS provides services in a number
of markets that have been recently successful in attracting foreign direct investment. Post-Acquisition,
we would seek to broadly align KCS’s results of operations with the Group’s operational metrics in that
region.

We believe that the acquisition of KCS will provide us with broad, well-diversified channels for sourcing
new business in Asia, particularly through referrals from international audit firms and through crossselling new products and services to KCS’s existing clients. KCS is well-recognized within the industry,
and provides services to a wide-ranging client portfolio base, which includes Fortune 500 companies,
large multinational groups, private companies and small- and medium-sized enterprises. KCS provides
its services to a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, automotive, energy, chemicals,
machinery, pharmaceuticals, information technology, home appliances, retail, finance and insurance.
KCS is led by an experienced management team consisting of individuals with an average of over
20 years of experience in the accounting and corporate services sectors and extensive contacts within
the corporate services industry.

We and KCS provide services in six overlapping jurisdictions: China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore,
Taiwan and Vietnam. Although we provide similar services to KCS in these overlapping markets, we
believe that KCS generally has a distinct, complementary set of clients within key industry segments,
such as retail, luxury retail, automotive and technology. Furthermore, the overlap between us and KCS
provides an opportunity to extract cost savings through process and improvements and elimination of
certain duplicative costs. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’

Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will take steps to integrate KCS. Leveraging institutional
knowledge from our previous mergers and acquisitions, we will appoint an integration project manager
and put in place a dedicated project management office. We will develop a detailed project plan and
work plan and assign our team members with clear roles, responsibilities and deliverables.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**
**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with_
_our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. The Consolidated Financial Statements_
_have been prepared in accordance with IFRS._

_The information contained in the discussion set forth below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum_
_includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. See ‘‘Certain Definition and_
_Presentation of Other Financial Data’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of important factors that could_
_cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking_
_statements contained in this Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading global provider of high value business services to clients operating and investing
globally. We focus on providing highly specialized and business-critical financial, legal and human
resource administrative services that enable our clients to operate their corporate structures, finance
vehicles and investment funds in different geographical locations. We operate from 116 offices in
82 jurisdictions across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. The range of services we
offer covers:

- _Corporate services—integrated legal, administrative and accounting services for companies’_
operations from inception through day-to-day functions to liquidation;

- _Structured finance services—creating and administering financial vehicles for securitization_
transactions, structured asset leasing and project finance transactions;

- _Fund services—back office functions for a wide range of investment funds, including the_
preparation of accounts and daily NAV calculations; and

- _Private client services—administering corporate structures for high net worth individuals for wealth_
planning purposes.

Across our range of services, we offer our clients a core set of competencies that form the heart of our
product offering including:

- _Financial administrative services. We provide a range of financial, accounting and reporting_
services to assist our clients with their financial reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate
manner. We prepare statutory accounts to comply with local law requirements and offer
international management and consolidated reporting in accordance with major accounting
standards. We also provide assistance with the registration, recovery and compliance with VAT, IPT
and other indirect taxes. In addition, we provide investment fund clients with fund accounting and
valuation services.

- _Legal administrative services. We provide a variety of legal administrative services to our clients in_
connection with establishing and maintaining financing and holding companies and other
structures in compliance with applicable local laws. These services include establishing corporate
entities to serve as finance companies or as operating companies, as well as managing corporate
compliance procedures, such as organizing and recording board and shareholders’ meetings. We
also provide domiciliary and management services, as well as local representatives and directors
with the necessary expertise, required for clients to conduct business in a particular jurisdiction.

- _Human resource administrative services. We provide a wide range of human resource and payroll_
services, including payroll processing, management reporting and cost analysis and outsourced
human resource services. Our specialists can act as a client’s local human resources function,
preparing employment contracts and guidelines, providing employee training assistance and
securely maintaining personal confidential information.

Our service offerings enable our clients to focus on their core operations while we ensure that critical
local administrative functions, that clients may have less experience in providing, are performed to a high
standard. In doing so, we help our clients (i) gain access to specialized local knowledge, including
regulatory, tax and financial reporting expertise that would be challenging or inefficient to develop
internally, (ii) reduce the risks and distractions of managing complex accounting, legal and human
resource regulations in multiple countries, (iii) control costs by taking over the back office administration

and reporting functions of their international offices that are not large enough to justify the administrative
overhead, (iv) simplify operations by providing a single point-of-contact from anywhere in the world,
often resulting in increased transparency for our clients, and (v) execute globalization plans swiftly and
flexibly by using our worldwide network of local offices and experts to assist on administrative matters.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e401.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e108.9 million. A significant proportion of our overall revenue comes from our long-standing
clients. Our strategy for winning new business includes cross-selling and up-selling to these existing
clients, but it also focuses on building relationships with new clients across our business segments. In
the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, 78.1% of our revenue was generated from our corporate
services business segment, and 63.5% of our revenue was generated from our Benelux and EMEA
segments. Although a significant portion of our revenue is produced by our operations in Benelux, this
revenue is generated by clients from all over the world seeking to use our services in the perceived tax
efficient jurisdictions of the Netherlands and Luxembourg to service their international corporate
structures. As a result, a significant portion of this revenue is not directly tied to economic activity in the
Benelux region. We plan to continue to expand our operations into new markets in the Asia-Pacific
region and the Americas through organic growth and acquisitions.

Across our range of services, we have a diverse client base that includes multinational companies of
varying sizes, insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private companies
as well as high net-worth individuals. Our clients include companies using international subsidiaries to
conduct foreign commercial operations, and foreign entities to create more efficient overall corporate
structures. As of March 31, 2014, we provide services to more than 36,600 client entities. Our client base
is relatively fragmented, with the largest 20 clients contributing less than 6% of our revenue in 2013. Our
client entity retention rate was approximately 85% in each of the years from 2011 through 2013 and in the
first three months of 2014, reflecting the largely recurring nature of our business, which we believe
makes our business generally less susceptible to global business cycles. Management believes that this
percentage of client entity retention understates our underlying client retention as a number of our client
entities (e.g. SPV financing entities) have a finite life and are replaced over time. Such replacements are
reflected as a loss of client entities (in calculating retention rates) even though we typically retain the
replacement business. A large proportion of our client base consists of long-standing clients and these
continuing relationships have been critical to our growth.

Our current global reach and breadth of expertise mean that we are one of the few business services
organizations able to offer clients global solutions while also being positioned as a neutral
execution-only service provider (meaning, we are not affiliated with an accounting, financial or law firm)
and thus do not have similar issues with being conflicted out of taking on new work. We believe that we
are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the growing opportunities presented by the globalization
of business and the growing trend of businesses outsourcing support functions.

**Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations during the periods under review have been primarily affected by:

**_Growth Through Mergers and Acquisitions_**

We have historically had an active acquisition program which provided additional scale to our business
and helped us consolidate a fragmented market by filing geographic gaps in our business and increase
our presence in existing markets and specific service lines. These acquisitions have significantly
impacted our results of operations in the period under review. We may expand our operations through
acquisitions that meet our investment criteria going forward if suitable opportunities arise, which may
similarly have a significant impact on our results of operations for future periods.

In 2011, we completed our merger with Equity Trust for a total consideration of e215.1 million, with a
cash outflow, net of cash acquired, of e172.2 million. This merger improved our market position in
profitable, established markets, such as Luxembourg and in high growth markets, such as the Asia
Pacific region, and was generally value accretive as our two companies operated complementary
businesses. We also achieved cost synergies, particularly by reducing the overall number of our full time
employees, as we integrated our operations and reduced duplicative overhead costs by consolidating
our offices where possible.

During 2012, we did not make any substantial acquisitions.

55


-----

In the final quarter of 2013, we acquired Accepta A.S., one of the Norway’s largest accounting groups.
This acquisition further enhanced our presence in Scandinavia.

In January 2014, we acquired the assets and liabilities of PT Tass Axia Solusi, an Indonesian company,
which expanded our presence in Indonesia. To expand our other fund services offerings, we also
acquired the non-controlling interest in the Custom House Group in January 2014, which was subject to
regulatory approval, which we received in the second quarter of 2014. In July 2014, we entered into the
Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 100% of the share capital of KCS,
an independent pan-Asian corporate services provider specializing in corporate accounting, corporate
secretarial and payroll services

**_Growth Through Greenfield Expansion_**

We also have expanded the scale of our business by opening offices and starting operations in new
countries where we did not previously have a presence. In the last twelve months, we have opened new
offices in Qatar and Canada. We typically open new offices when we have requests from existing clients
to provide services. Our new offices, however, will typically operate at a loss for a period of time as we
acquire the necessary infrastructure, such as office space and personnel, before revenues generated by
client services are sufficient to cover our operating costs. As a result, our continued expansion through
opening new offices may impact our operating profits in the short term as we invest in growing the scale
of our business.

**_Realization of Economies of Scale and Operating Efficiencies_**

We have expanded the scale of our business through a number of means, including mergers and
acquisitions, greenfield expansion and organic growth in markets in which we previously operated. As
we continue to expand our business, we have been able to realize certain economies of scale through
integration of our offices and the implementation of group-wide strategies as well as a group-wide sales
function.

**_Wages and Salaries_**

Our largest expense consists of personnel costs associated with our employees, the majority of which
consists of wages and salaries. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and in the three
months ended March 31, 2014, wages and salaries totaled e150.0 million, e161.5 million, e162.8 million
and e43.7 million, respectively, or 40.0%, 41.2%, 41.0% and 43.2% of revenue in each period,
respectively. The costs we incurred from wages and salaries have increased in each of the periods
between the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2013
and the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014, reflecting, in large part, an increase in the
number of FTEs. As wages and salaries typically constitute our largest expense, any increase or
decrease in wages and salaries paid can have a significant impact on our operating profits.

**_Redundancy and Restructuring Costs_**

We incur costs related to staff redundancies, premises (e.g. onerous lease contracts), IT and
professional fees, both in relation to completed mergers and acquisitions as well as ordinary course
restructurings of our business. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and in the three
months ended March 31, 2014 our redundancy and restructuring costs totaled e34.5 million,
e19.8 million, e7.4 million and e1.5 million, respectively.

**_Macro-Economic Trends and Global Economic Performance_**

As a global business, we are exposed to changes in the economic and financial performance of the
countries in which we operate and the state of the global economy as a whole. The growth of our
business may be influenced by the willingness of multi-national corporations to expand outside of their
home jurisdictions and is broadly tied to trends in global trade and foreign investment. In particular, our
corporate, human resources and payroll services benefit from the continued expansion of multi-national
corporations into new jurisdictions of operation where we can provide support and administrative
services or corporate structuring solutions. Such trends in global trade and foreign investment can
impact our long-term growth prospects and the demand for our services. In addition, we are exposed to
more short-term fluctuations in global economic activity through our fund services and structure finance
services businesses, which are dependent on the volume of relevant financing transactions and

56


-----

aggregate amount of funds under administration and can fluctuate with the level of economic growth in
developed economies. In addition, certain segments of our corporate services, in particular the human
resources and payroll services we provide in emerging economies, such as those of Eastern Europe,
can fluctuate in-line with the macro-economic trends in those regions.

**_Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Translation_**

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations arising from various
currency exposures primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign exchange
fluctuations through commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, and investments in
foreign operations. Our subsidiary companies rarely provide services to third parties that are not
denominated in their functional currency, except for our operations in certain countries, such as Russia
or Switzerland, where our subsidiaries typically receive payment for services in euro, and the operations
of Custom House, which provides fund services, where expenses are incurred in euro and payment is
received in U.S. dollars. While the net assets of our subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are
also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, we seek to manage this exposure primarily through
borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. We do not otherwise hedge our foreign
currency exposure.

Our consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is our functional and presentation
currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into our functional currency using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in our income statement. For the three
months ended March 31, 2014, foreign currency translation differences for foreign operations totaled a
loss of e2.2 million, and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, totaled a gain of
e11.2 million, a gain of e2.1 million and a loss of e13.6 million, respectively.

**Description of Key Components of Our Income Statement**

**_Revenue_**

Our sole source of revenue is from the rendering of services. We provide services to clients on a time and
cost basis or based on a fixed price contract or a combination of both. Our revenue is generally derived
from our client engagements based on an annual fee for agreed services plus an hourly rate for
additional work undertaken. The exception to this is the fund services we provide, where our fees are
based on the net asset value of funds under administration (subject to a minimum fee level) and services
where we receive fees per transaction, such as fees for incorporating special purpose vehicles. We fix
the rates for our services locally based on local market conditions and local management
determinations of acceptable rates. Our annual fee element is a fixed fee which is often paid up-front.

The majority of our clients (i) do not have long-term contracts with us, or (ii) have contracts that may be
terminated on short notice at the client’s convenience. We believe, however, that the depth of our
knowledge about each client and the potentially high costs and execution risk of moving providers,
results in generally high retention rates. The annual recurrence of business in certain types of our
services also contributes to our high client retention rates. Historically, the main reasons for client churn
are in-sourcing, clients exiting of the particular market, structures expiring or clients leaving to
competition.

Revenue from time and cost contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as time has been spent and
direct expenses are incurred. Revenue from fixed price contracts is generally recognized in the period in
which the services are provided, using a straight line basis over the term of the contract.

If circumstances arise that may change the original estimate of revenues, costs or extent of progress
toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in
estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
give rise to the revision become known. To the extent that any fees paid on account exceed the value of
work performed, they are included in trade and other payables as deferred income.

**_Segment Reporting_**

We report our revenue on the basis of geographical segments: Benelux, EMEA (excluding Benelux),
Americas, APAC; and two additional segments that are included within our geographical segment

57


-----

presentation that we have determined to show separately as their financial performance is not tied to any
one geographic region: fund services and other (which includes the operations of our international
licensing and collection business, Freeway, and our international pension business, Panthera Ltd., as
well as our corporate expenses). We also report our revenue on the basis of business segments:
corporate services, structured finance services, fund services and private client services.

Inter-segment revenue comprises management fees and services provided to clients by other entities in
our Group. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under normal commercial terms and
conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. Total geographic segment revenues
presented in this Offering Memorandum are net of inter-segment revenues.

**_Employee benefit expenses_**

Employee benefit expenses consists of wages and salaries, social security costs, pension costs and
other personnel costs.

**_Rental and office expenses_**

Rental and office expenses consist of expenses related to the rental of office space for our personnel. We
own one office building in Cura¸cao and rent the remaining office space as either a head tenant,
sub-tenant or on behalf of our customers as serviced offices.

**_Professional fees_**

Professional fees consist of audit fees, legal fees—particularly in relation to on-going litigation—and
other advisory fees that we incur.

**_Sales, general and administrative expenses_**

Sales, general and administrative expenses include marketing and bad debt expenses, travel and other
costs associated with our business operations.

**_Other income/(expenses)_**

Other income and expenses include those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of our financial performance. Transactions which may
give rise to other income and expenses are principally gains and losses on disposal of investments and
subsidiaries, acquisition due diligence costs, start-up and integration related costs as well as
redundancy and restructuring costs not in the ordinary course of business. See ‘‘—Redundancy and
_Restructuring Costs.’’_

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment charges_**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment includes depreciation and amortization or impairment of
intangible and tangible assets. Intangible assets include goodwill, client lists, non-compete agreements,
Group brands and computer software. Tangible fixed assets include owned buildings, leasehold
improvements, furniture and fittings, office and computer equipment and motor vehicles. Our
impairment charges primarily relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade receivables.

**_Net finance costs_**

Net finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate
method, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses. The variables
affecting our net finance costs include interest rates, foreign exchange movements and amortization.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in
the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity in which
case it is recognized in equity. As we generate revenue and recognize income though our network of
foreign subsidiaries, we may recognize a loss in a subsidiary while generating a profit at the group level
or recognize income in a jurisdiction with a lower statutory tax rate than the Netherlands, which is the

58


-----

jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer. As a result, our effective tax rate at the consolidated level can
vary significantly from our statutory tax rate in the Netherlands in any given taxable period.

Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of
any asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable income statement. Deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income
tax liability is settled.

**Non-Controlling Interests/Shelf Companies/Cash Box Companies**

We own the majority of the share capital of all of our subsidiaries, except for Panthera Ltd. and Parnassus
Accounting France SAS, and certain members of the Group that for legal or commercial reasons in some
jurisdictions may be owned by third parties or employees of the Group but are fully consolidated in our
Group accounts as we are able to demonstrate full management and economic control. As for Freeway,
while we fully consolidate this business into our income statement and include all of the revenue it
generates and expenses it incurs within our results of operations, we report a correction to our results for
the period for those interests we do not own as non-controlling interests on our income statement to
reflect the impact of those minority stakes on our results of operations. In the years ended December 31,
2011, 2012 and 2013, we reported negative non-controlling interest of e1.5 million, e1.4 million and
e1.2 million, respectively, and positive non-controlling interest of e0.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2014.

In addition, as part of our business, we acquire, incorporate and/or organize various forms of legal
entities (which we refer to as ‘‘shelf companies’’) that we maintain for or sell to our clients. We also
acquire, incorporate and/or organize cash box companies to hold cash that is pledged to secure loans.
These companies are consolidated in our results of operations. Shelf companies and cash box
companies will not be considered restricted subsidiaries for purposes of the Indentures.

**Trading Update**

We believe that our revenue for the second quarter of 2014 will be marginally higher than our revenue for
the second quarter of 2013. We believe that our Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2014 will be
marginally lower than our Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2013.

The above information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational
results for the full year 2014. The preliminary estimates above were prepared based on a number of
assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change.
Accordingly, our actual results may vary from our preliminary estimates above, and such variations could
be material. See ‘‘Notice on Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a more complete
discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation.

During the three months ended March 31, 2014, our revenue increased by e4.1 million, or 4.2%, to
e101.3 million from e97.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. The increase in revenue in
the first quarter of 2014 was primarily driven by our operations in Benelux, EMEA and APAC, offset by a
decrease in revenues from fund services. From a business segment perspective, revenue growth was
mainly due to increased revenue from corporate services and structured finance services, offset by a
decrease in revenue in private client services and fund services.

**_Geographical Segments_**

_Benelux:_ Our revenues in the Benelux region increased by e1.7 million, or 5.5%, to e32.1 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2014, from e30.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. This
increase was due to an increase in revenues from corporate services in both the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.

_EMEA:_ Our revenues in the EMEA region increased by e4.4 million, or 15.0%, to e33.7 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2014, from e29.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. This
increase was mainly driven by the increase in revenues from corporate services in the United Kingdom,
Jersey, Spain and Russia. Structured finance services in Russia, Ireland and the United Kingdom also
increased. Revenue was positively impacted by e2.1 million due to the acquisition of Accepta A.S. in
Norway.

At constant currency, the increase was e4.8 million or 16.7%. On a like for like basis in constant currency
and adjusting for the acquisition in Norway year on year growth was 9.4%.

_Americas:_ Our revenues in the Americas region decreased by e0.4 million, or 2.1%, to e16.9 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e17.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013.
This decrease was due to negative currency effects. At constant currency, our revenue increased by
e2.1 million or 14.2%. The currency impact arose mainly from our operations in Argentina and Brazil. The
constant currency increase was mainly driven by the increase in corporate services, mainly human
resources and payroll, in Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and the United States. In addition, structured
finance services in Argentina also increased, offset by the decrease of private client services in BVI.

_APAC:_ Our revenues in the APAC region increased by e0.7 million, or 6.1%, to e12.3 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2014, from e11.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. The
revenue in APAC increased as a result of new client engagements for corporate services in China, Japan,
Singapore, Australia and India. The acquisition in Indonesia had a positive impact of e0.1 million on
revenues. At constant currency, the increase was e1.6 million or 14.5%. On a like for like basis in
constant currency and adjusting for the acquisition in Indonesia, year-on-year growth was 13.3%.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased by e2.1 million, or 29.6%, to e4.9 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e6.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013,
primarily due to the termination of a significant client contract. In addition, the net asset value of the funds
under administration has decreased, as has the amount of the funds under administration. The business
segment has won new mandates, but there is an increased time lag before these mandates generate
revenues. We were able to partially compensate for the lost revenue by decreasing the number of FTEs.
The ongoing integration of Custom House and TMF Fund Services is expected to reduce staff costs. At
constant currency, the decrease was e1.9 million or 28.5%.

_Other:_ Our revenues from other sources decreased by e0.2 million, or 15.3%, to e1.3 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2014, from e1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. This
decrease was due to decreased revenue from group clients. In the three months ended March 31, 2013,
e0.4 million of revenue from group clients was included in the ‘‘other’’ results. This revenue is included in
the regional revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2014.

**_Business Segments_**

_Corporate services:_ Our revenues from corporate services increased by e6.8 million, or 9.2%, to
e80.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e73.9 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013, primarily due to new client engagements in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain,
Poland, Jersey, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, the United States, Brazil, China, Japan, Singapore,
Australia and India. The new client engagements in these countries were principally related to increased

61


-----

demand for human resource administrative services, accounting and tax services and international
structuring services in these markets.

The growth at constant currency was e10.3 million, or 14.6%. On a like for like basis in constant currency
and adjusting for the acquisitions in Norway and Indonesia, year-on-year growth was 11.4%.

_Structured finance services:_ Our revenues from structured finance services increased by e0.5 million,
or 5.6%, to e8.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e8.5 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in Luxembourg, Ireland, the UK, Russia and Argentina.
The growth at constant currency was e0.9 million, or 11.1%.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased by e2.1 million, or 29.6%, to e4.9 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e6.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013.
The decrease at constant currency was 28.5%

_Private client services:_ Our revenues from private client services decreased by e1.1 million, or 13.6%,
to e6.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e7.9 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reclassification of certain clients to
corporate services and a reduction in the number of clients, due to a re-focusing of the private client
value proposition, and the consequential reduction in ‘‘non-core’’ clients. The decrease at constant
currency was e0.9 million, or 12.2%.

_Employee benefit expenses_

Our employee benefit expenses increased by e3.3 million, or 6.2%, to e56.1 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2014, from e52.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. At constant
currency, the personnel expenses increased by 5.4 million, or 10.7%.

The average number of FTE’s for the three months ended March 31, 2014 increased by 6.6%, to 4,634 in
the three months ended March 31, 2014, from 4,349 in the three months ended March 31, 2013. The
average salary per FTE in the period decreased by e1.6 thousand, or 4.2%, to e37.7 thousand in the
three months ended March 31, 2014, from e39.3 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2013.

Our employee benefit expenses consist of wages and salaries paid to employees, other personnel
costs, social security costs, pensions costs to defined contribution plans and pension costs to defined
benefit plans. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our employee benefit expenses for the three
months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014:

_Rental and office expenses_

Our rental and office expenses are equal in the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to increases in rent, offset by currency effects.

_Professional fees_

Our professional fees paid increased by e0.5 million, or 19.9%, to e2.8 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2014, from e2.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to higher
outsourcing costs.

_Sales, general and administrative expenses_

Our sales, general and administrative expenses increased by e0.4 million, or 8.1%, to e5.2 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2014, from e4.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013,
primarily due to higher marketing expenses and higher costs related to our insurance.

During the three months ended March 31, 2014, our results from operating activities before depreciation,
amortization, impairment charges and other income / (expenses) (which we refer to below as ‘‘results
from operating activities’’) was e25.5 million, which was equal to our results from operating activities in
the three months ended March 31, 2013. Our results from operating activities mainly increased in
Benelux and EMEA, but was offset by a decrease in results from operating activities in fund services and
other, mostly corporate costs which reflect ongoing investment in building sales capability.

We discuss below our results from operating activities on a geographic segment basis expressed as a
percentage of revenue, which we refer to as operating margin.

_Benelux:_ Our results from operating activities in the Benelux region increased by e1.3 million, or 7.8%,
to e17.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e16.3 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013, primarily due to higher revenues. Operating margin increased to 54.8% in the three
months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to 53.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2013.

_EMEA:_ Our results from operating activities in the EMEA region increased by e2.2 million, or 22.5%, to
e11.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014 from e9.7 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013, primarily due to increased revenues. At constant currency, results from operating
activities increased by e2.3 million, or 23.8%. The acquisition in Norway had a positive impact of
e0.7 million on results from operating activities. At constant currency and adjusted for the impact of the
acquisition, results from operating activities increased by e1.6 million, or 16.5%. Operating margin
increased to 35.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to 33.0% in the three
months ended March 31, 2013.

_Americas:_ Our results from operating activities in the Americas region increased by e0.2 million, or
3.4%, to e5.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e4.9 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to increased revenue from new client engagements, offset by
increased costs from the expansion of operations. At constant currency, results from operating activities
increased by e0.7 million, or 14.7%. Operating margin in the Americas region increased to 30.1% in the
three months ended March 31, 2013, from 28.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily
due to the realization of certain economies of scale in the business.

_APAC:_ Our results from operating activities in the APAC region increased by e0.2 million, or 6.9%, to
e2.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from e2.2 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013, primarily due to increased revenues. At constant currency, results from operating
activities increased by e0.3 million, or 16.0%. Operating margin in the APAC region for the three months
ended March 31, 2014 is 19.0%, which is equal to the results from operating activities margin in the APAC
region for the three months ended March 31, 2013.

_Fund services:_ Our results from operating activities from fund services decreased by e1.0 million, or
61.4%, to e0.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014 from e1.6 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to decreased revenues, partially offset by lower personnel costs
arising from a lower average of FTEs in 2014. At constant currency, our results from operating activities
decreased by e0.9 million, or 60.2%. Operating margin in the fund services decreased to 12.7% for the
three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to 23.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2013.

_Other:_ Our results from operating activities in our other segment decreased by e2.7 million, or 29.6%,
to a loss of e12.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, from a loss of e9.3 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to increased costs arising from investments in
building the global sales team and higher IT and marketing costs.

e1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014 from e1.8 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2013. The decrease in depreciation is in line with the lower balance of property, plant and
equipment as of the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the balance as of March 31,
2013.

Amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased by e2.4 million, or 40.8%, to

March 31, 2014 from e1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to a reduction
in certain tax rebates.

_Results for the year_

Our revenue increased by e5.0 million, or 1.3%, to e396.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013
from e391.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to growth in revenue generated
from the corporate services and structured finance services business segments, offset by decreases in
revenue generated from the fund services and private client services business segments.

**_Geographical Segments_**

_Benelux:_ Our revenues in the Benelux region increased by e3.4 million, or 2.8%, to e125.8 million in the
year ended December 31, 2013 from e122.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due
to increased revenue from the provision of corporate services and structured finance services in
Luxembourg and structured finance services in the Netherlands. In both countries the number of
structured finance structures increased. In Luxembourg the number of clients in the corporate services
also increased. The revenue per average FTE in the Benelux region increased by e1.9 thousand, or
0.8%, to e232.1 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e230.2 thousand in the year ended
December 31, 2012.

_EMEA:_ Our revenues in the EMEA region increased by e4.4 million, or 3.7%, to e122.8 million in the
year ended December 31, 2013 from e118.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due
to new client engagements for corporate services in Austria, Spain, the UK and Poland and client
engagements for structured finance services in Russia and Ireland. Revenue was negatively impacted
by the deconsolidation of part of the activities in France from December 2012 (e2.5 million of revenue in
the year ended December 31, 2012) and positively impacted by the acquisition of Accepta A.S. in
November 2013 (e0.6 million of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013). Our revenue per FTE in
the EMEA region decreased by approximately e2.1 thousand, or 2.1%, to approximately e99.1 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2013 from approximately e101.2 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2012, as a result of investment in new staff in smaller countries, where efficiency is lower.

_Americas:_ Our revenues in the Americas region increased by e0.9 million, or 1.3%, to e70.3 million in
the year ended December 31, 2013 from e69.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily
due to new client engagements for corporate services in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Central America and
Peru, offset by a decrease in revenue in British Virgin Islands and Curacao as a result of a reduction in the
private client services. Our revenue per FTE in the Americas region increased by approximately
e0.7 thousand, or 1.2%, to approximately e60.6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013 from
approximately e59.9 for the year ended December 31, 2012, due to improved efficiency.

_APAC:_ Our revenues in the APAC region increased by e3.8 million, or 8.6%, to e48.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013 from e44.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of new
client engagements for corporate services in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. In addition, the

65


-----

revenue from the operations in China increased as we opened new offices in 2012 and gained new
clients. Our revenue per FTE in the APAC region increased by approximately e6.9 thousand, or 13.3%, to
approximately e58.6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013 from approximately
e51.7 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012, due to our smaller offices achieving increased
economies of scale and our improved efficiency.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased by e8.6 million, or 26.3%, to e24.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2013 from e32.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. primarily
due to the termination of a significant client contract. In addition, the net asset value of the funds under
administration decreased as did the amount of the funds under administration. Our revenue per FTE
from fund services decreased by approximately e9.9 thousand, or 9.1%, to approximately
e98.2 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013 from approximately e108.1 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2012, as we were able to partially compensate for the lost revenue by decreasing
the number of FTEs.

_Other:_ Our revenues from other sources increased by e1.1 million, or 24.3%, to e5.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013 from e4.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of
increased revenue from Freeway associated with new royalty fee administration contract wins and
higher revenue from our clients not allocated to the regions above.

**_Business Segments_**

_Corporate services:_ Our revenues from corporate services increased by e13.0 million, or 4.4%, to
e306.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e293.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2012. primarily due to new client engagements for the provision of corporate services in the growth
countries such as Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, the UK, Poland, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Central America,
Peru, Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. These new client engagements were principally related to
the increased demand for the human resource administrative and accounting services in these markets.
This increase in demand was partially offset by the decision to deconsolidate certain activities in France
and positively impacted by the acquisition in Norway.

_Structured finance services:_ Our revenues from structured finance services increased by e4.5 million,
or 13.5%, to e37.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e33.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to growth in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, UK, Russia and
Argentina.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased by e8.6 million, or 26.3%, to e24.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2013 from e32.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily
due to the termination of a significant client contract. In addition, the net asset value of the funds under
administration has decreased as has the amount of the funds under administration.

_Private client services:_ Our revenues from private client services decreased by e3.8 million, or 11.8%,
to e28.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e32.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2012, primarily due to a reduction in the number of clients, due to our decision to focus on our larger
clients, and the subsequent reduction in the number of our ‘non-core’ clients.

_Employee benefit expenses_

Our employee benefit expenses increased by e3.7 million, or 1.8%, to e208.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2013 from e205.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Our employee benefit
expenses per FTE totaled approximately e47.2 thousand in 2013 and approximately e48.6 thousand in
2012.

Our employee benefit expenses consist of wages and salaries paid to employees, other personnel
costs, social security costs, pensions costs to defined contribution plans and pension costs to defined

benefit plans. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our employee benefit expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2013:

(1) IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. We decided to early adopt this amended IAS19 for the financial year
beginning 1 January 2012. Due to elimination of the corridor approach, the recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in
other comprehensive income and a change of estimate regarding the plan assets, the retirement benefit obligation as at
January 1, 2012 increased (and retained earnings decreased) with e0.2 million.

_Rental and office expenses_

Our rental and office expenses decreased by e1.7 million, or 3.4%, to e48.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2013 from e50.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, principally resulting from
the consolidation of offices in the Netherlands.

year ended December 31, 2013 from e20.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due
increased marketing and sales expenses, offset by a lower charge in respect to the allowance for
overdue receivables.

_Results from operating activities before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other_
_income/(expenses)_

During the year ended December 31, 2013, our results from operating activities before depreciation,
amortization, impairment charges and other income/(expenses) (which we refer to below as ‘‘results
from operating activities’’) increased by e1.6 million, or 1.5% to e108.9 million from e107.3 million in the
year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased revenues and improved efficiency. Our
results from operating activities expressed as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% in both 2012 and
2013.

We discuss below our results from operating activities on a geographic basis expressed as a percentage
of revenue, which we refer to as operating margin.

to e69.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e66.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2012, primarily due to an increase in revenues from the operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxembourg. Our operating margin in the Benelux region decreased to 55.2% in the year ended

42.1%, to e21.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from e15.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased revenues from new client engagements, offset by
increased costs from the expansion of the operations. Our operating margin in the Americas region
increased to 30.5% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 21.8% in the year ended December 31,
2012, primarily due to increased economies of scale.

lower average number of FTEs in 2013. Our operating margin from fund services decreased to 19.4% in
the year ended December 31, 2013 from 28.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012, as the decreased
revenues were not fully offset by decreased costs.

_Other:_ Our loss from operating activities in our other segment decreased by e18.6 million, or 90.1%,
from a loss of e39.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, to a loss of e20.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2012. This segment consists mainly of our corporate expenses, which increased in
the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to
our investments in building the global sales team, higher IT costs and higher marketing costs, all of
which are reported at a group corporate level.

_Other expenses_

Our other expenses decreased by e9.7 million, or 45.5%, to e11.6 million in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2013 from e21.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to

from e8.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in depreciation is in line with
reduced investments in the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended

During the year ended December 31, 2012, our revenue increased by e17.1 million, or 4.6%, to
e391.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e374.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2011 primarily due to the reasons set out below.

**_Geographical Segments_**

_Benelux:_ Our revenues in the Benelux region decreased by e3.6 million, or 2.8%, to e122.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2012 from e125.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily
due to decreased revenue from the provision of corporate services and structured finance services in the
Netherlands. Our revenue per average FTE in the Benelux region decreased by e6.3 thousand, or 3% to

69


-----

e230.4 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012 from e236.7 for the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to decreased general levels of global economic activity leading to decreased
demand for new corporate structures and other corporate services.

_EMEA:_ Our revenues in the EMEA region increased by e6.1 million, or 5.5%, to e118.4 million in the
year ended December 31, 2012 from e112.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a
result of new client engagements for the corporate services in Jersey, the United Kingdom and Spain
and the continued growth of the operations in Russia, principally relating to the provision of structured
finance services. Our revenue per average FTE in the EMEA region increased by e3.3 thousand, or 3%,
to e100.2 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012 from e96.9 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2011, as a result of increased efficiency.

_Americas:_ Our revenues in the Americas region increased by e7.5 million, or 12.1%, to e69.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2012 from e61.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily
due to new client engagements for corporate services in Argentina, Chile and Colombia. Our revenue
per average FTE in the Americas region increased by e6.2 thousand, or 12.0%, to e59.8 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2012 from e53.6 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to
improved efficiency, as a result of staff reductions in Argentina and Brazil, as we integrated the
operations in Argentina following the merger with Equity Trust and restructured the operations in Brazil to
reduce costs. These staff reductions were partially offset by an increase in the number of regional staff
following the merger with Equity Trust as we sought to strengthen corporate management in the region.

_APAC:_ Our revenues in the APAC region increased by e6.5 million, or 17.1%, to e44.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2012 from e37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to
new client engagements for corporate services in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as the
opening of new offices in the region.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased by e0.2 million, or 0.5%, to e32.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2012 from e33.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily
due to a slight decrease in the amount of funds under administration. Our revenue per average FTE from
fund services increased by e19.5 thousand, or 20.0%, to e119.0 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2012 from e99.5 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011, as we were able to
decrease the number of the average FTEs in the fund services segment following the merger with Equity
Trust while maintaining stable revenues based on funds under administration.

_Other:_ Our revenues from other sources increased by e0.7 million, or 19.7%, to e4.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2012 from e3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to
increased revenue from Freeway associated with new royalty fee administration contract wins.

**_Business Segments_**

_Corporate services:_ Our revenues from corporate services increased by e17.3 million, or 6.3%, to
e293.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e276.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to increased demand for human resource administrative services in these markets.
This increase in demand was partially offset by a decrease in the provision of corporate services in the
Netherlands, particularly a decreased demand for international structuring services.

_Structured finance services:_ Our revenues from structured finance services decreased by e1.1 million,
or 3.3%, to e33.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e34.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to lower levels of economic activity globally leading to a decreased
volume of structured finance transactions and fewer special purpose vehicle incorporations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

_Fund services:_ Our revenues from fund services decreased slightly by e0.2 million, or 0.5%, to
e32.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e33.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2011, reflecting the relatively stable amounts of funds under administration during the period.

_Private client services:_ Our revenues from private client services increased by e1.1 million, or 3.6%, to
e32.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e31.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to the revised reporting of associated revenue following the merger with Equity Trust.

_Employee benefit expenses_

Our employee benefit expenses increased by e16.4 million, or 8.7%, to e205.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012 from e188.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. Our employee benefit
expenses per average FTE totaled e44.6 thousand in 2011 and e47.9 thousand in 2012.

Our employee benefit expenses consist of wages and salaries paid to employees, other personnel
costs, social security costs, pensions costs to defined contribution plans and pension costs to defined
benefit plans. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our employee benefit expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2012:

**Year Ended**
**December 31,**
**2011** **2012** **Change**
**(in g millions)** **(g millions)** **%**
**Total employee benefit expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **188.7** **205.0** **16.4** **8.7%**
_Of which_

Pension costs—defined benefit plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4 2.6 0.2 8.7%

_Rental and office expenses_

Our rental and office expenses increased by e0.9 million, or 1.8%, to e50.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012 from e49.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increases
in rental and IT expenses caused by the an increase in the number of offices, primarily due to the
expansion in China. This increase was slightly offset by a decrease in rents under some of our existing
lease arrangements.

_Professional fees_

Our professional fees paid decreased by e0.7 million, or 7.3%, to e9.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012 from e10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to lower audit
expenses, as we realized synergies from our merger with Equity Trust.

_Sales, general and administrative expenses_

Our sales, general and administrative expenses increased by e0.5 million, or 2.6%, to e20.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2012 from e19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011.

_Results from operating activities before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other_
_income/(expenses)_

During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, our results from operating activities before
depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other income/(expenses) (which we refer to below
as ‘‘results from operating activities’’) remained unchanged amounting to e107.3 million, respectively,
primarily due to increases in the results from operating activities in the Americas and fund services,
which were offset by a decrease in results from operating activities in APAC.

We discuss below our results from operating activities on a geographic basis expensed as a percentage
of revenue, which we refer to as operating margin.

_Benelux:_ Our results from operating activities in the Benelux region decreased by e0.6 million, or 0.8%,
to e66.5 million in the year ended December 2012 from e67.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to an increase in revenues from the operations in Belgium and Luxembourg, which
were offset by lower revenues from the operations in the Netherlands. This resulted in an increase in our
operating margin in the Benelux region to 54.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 53.2% in the
year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to our operations in Luxembourg.

_EMEA:_ Our results from operating activities in the EMEA region increased by e0.3 million, or 1.0%, to
e32.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e32.5 million in the year ended December 31,

71


-----

2011, primarily due to growth in the revenues from new client engagements, offset by increased cost
associated with employees hired for the global sales force in the region. Our operating margin in the
EMEA region decreased to 27.7% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 28.9% in the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased costs in the region.

_Americas:_ Our results from operating activities in the Americas region increased by e1.9 million, or
14.7%, to e15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e13.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased revenues from new client engagements, offset by
increased costs from the expansion of operations. This resulted in our operating margin in the Americas
region increasing to 21.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 21.3% in the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased economies of scale.

_APAC:_ Our results from operating activities in the APAC region decreased by e2.6 million, or 38.0% to
e4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e6.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to increased costs in the region as we invested in expanding the number of offices
and the sales force. Our operating margin in the APAC region was 9.4% in the year ended December 31,
2012, a decrease from 17.8% in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased costs in
the region.

_Fund services:_ Our results from operating activities from fund services increased by e1.6 million, or
20.4%, to e9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from e7.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to decreased wages and salary costs from a lower average number of
FTEs. Our operating margin from fund services increased to 28.6% in the year ended December 31,
2012 from 23.6% in the year ended December 31, 2011, as wage and salary costs decreased based on a
lower average number of FTEs.

_Other:_ Our results from operating activities in our other segment showed a loss of e20.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 2012, and a loss of e20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This
segments consists primarily of certain corporate expenses, which increased slightly in the year ended
December 31, 2012.

_Other expenses_

In 2012, our other expenses decreased by e24.5 million, or 53.4%, to e21.4 million in 2012 from
e45.9 million in 2011, primarily due to redundancy and restructuring costs arising from the merger with
Equity Trust.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our other expenses for the years ended December 31,
2011 and 2012:

**Year Ended**
**December 31,**
**2011** **2012** **Change**
**(in g millions)** **(g millions)** **%**
**Total other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(45.9)** **(21.4)** **24.5** **(53.4)**
_Of which_
Gain/(loss) on disposal of other non-current assets . . . . . . . (0.1) (0.2) (0.1) (81.5)
Acquisition, due diligence and start-up costs . . . . . . . . . . . . (11.2) (0.4) 10.8 (96.3)
Redundancy and restructuring costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (33.5) (19.8) 13.7 (40.9)

Acquisition, due diligence and start-up costs in 2012 mainly related to an increase in deferred
consideration. In 2011, these costs mainly related to costs incurred as result from the merger with Equity
Trust.

Redundancy and restructuring costs in 2012 mainly related to integration costs as a result of the merger
with Equity Trust. Redundancy and restructuring costs in 2011 mainly related to the preparation for the
merger with Equity Trust and restructuring of a few local offices.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment charges_

Depreciation decreased by e0.6 million, or 6.8%, to e7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011
from e8.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.

72


-----

Amortization decreased by e3.3 million, or 13.4%, to e21.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012
from e23.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the reduction in the
amortization of software and other intangible assets other than goodwill.

There was no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in the year ended December 31, 2012 or
December 31, 2011.

_Finance income_

Finance income primarily includes interest income on short-term bank deposits. In 2012, our finance
income increased by e3.1 million, or 24.5%, to e16.0 million from e12.8 million in 2011.

_Finance expenses_

Finance costs include interest payable on our financing arrangements, including the Revolving Credit
Facility, the secured mezzanine bank loan, the unsecured shareholder loan and secured bank
overdrafts. In 2012, our finance costs decreased by e0.5 million, or 0.5%, to e108.0 million in 2012 from
e108.5 million in 2011, principally as a result of certain refinancing transactions, which resulted in
increased accelerated amortization of capitalized finance costs.

_Income tax expense_

Our income tax expense increased by e0.2 million, or 2.4%, to e6.9 million in 2012 from e6.7 million in
2011 principally due to higher distribution-related taxes.

_Results for the year_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our loss for the period decreased by e31.9 million, or 43.0%, to
e42.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from a loss of e74.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from loans and
borrowings, including the Notes. We may also rely on secured bank overdrafts for cash management
purposes. We seek to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and funding through several sources,
including cash from operations, bank loans and the Notes, and expect cash flow from operating
activities and long-term loans and borrowings will be important sources of cash for us in the future. In
addition to financing our existing operations, our liquidity needs arise principally from our interest
obligations on our indebtedness, as well as cash used in investing activities, including the acquisition of
subsidiaries and associated restructuring and other transaction and integration costs.

Our net cash generated from operating activities increased by e8.9 million to e32.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2014 from e24.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily
due to a positive movement in working capital. In the three months ended March 31, 2013, we paid the
costs related to the December 2012 refinancing. The positive movement in working capital in the three
months ended March 31, 2014 relates to annual invoices which are invoiced and paid at the beginning of
the year.

Our net cash generated from operating activities decreased by e8.3 million to e100.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013 from e108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to
an increase in working capital due to high trade payables in 2012, which were paid off in 2013.

Our net cash generated from operating activities increased by e2.2 million to e108.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 from e106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to
increased efforts on cash collection.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by e4.4 million to e6.2 million in the three months
March 31, 2014 from e1.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to higher cash
flows due to the acquisition of PT Tass Axia Solusi and the payment of deferred compensation related to
Accepta A.S.

Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by e2.9 million to
e16.3 million from e13.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The cash used in investing
activities in the year ended December 31,2012 was higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013
due to certain investments in property, plant and equipment and software.

Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by e175.8 million
to e13.4 million from e189.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. The cash used in investing
activities was higher in the year ended December 31, 2011 than in the year ended December 31, 2012,
due to cash outflows arising from the merger with Equity Trust.

_Net cash from financing activities_

Net cash from financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2014 increased by e5.8 million to
net cash used in financing activities of e13.1 million from cash generated of e7.3 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to the repayment of cash box loans.

Net cash from financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by e8.7 million to an
outflow of e48 million in 2013 to an outflow of e39.3 million in 2012, due to high interest payments on
certain debt and the repayment of certain financial lease obligations.

Net cash from financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by e191.6 million to
e39.3 million from e152.3 million in 2011, primarily due to the financing of the merger with Equity Trust in
2011.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures, or capital resources.

**Financial Risk Management**

Our activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks with respect to foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rate risk, as well as credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall financial
risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize
potential adverse effects on our financial performance.

Financial risk management is carried out by our central treasury department (‘‘Treasury’’) under policies
approved by our management. Our Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close
co-operation with our operating units. Our management provides written policies for overall risk
management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk, credit risk, use of financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and
investments of excess liquidity.

Our Treasury risk management policy is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations
in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and the
currency exposure of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.

**_Cash Flow and Fair Value Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that unexpected interest rate changes negatively affect our results, cash flows
and equity.

It is our policy to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility on our results, cash flows and balance sheet
within certain boundaries. As we have no significant interest-bearing assets, our income and operating
cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.

Our interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to
cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk.

We analyze our interest rate exposure simulating various scenarios taking into consideration
refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Based on these scenarios,
we calculate the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift and determine whether
derivative financial instruments should be in place to limit the interest rate risk to an acceptable level.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Risk_**

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar. In several markets, client contracts are denominated
in euro or U.S. dollar although that is not the local currency.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and
investments in foreign operations.

We have certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of our foreign operations is managed
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currency.

We enter into derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes. All derivatives are approved
by our management prior to our commitment. As of March 31, 2014, no currency derivatives were
outstanding.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that counterparties fail to meet their contractual payment obligations through
insolvency or default as well as credit exposure to clients.

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions is managed centrally. Credit exposures to clients, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions are managed on a local basis.

76


-----

We have no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum credit risk exposure of our financial
assets at the end of the period is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance
sheet headings.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient headroom (cash and cash equivalents plus
committed credit lines) available to meet both our day-to-day operating requirements and debt servicing
obligations (interest and debt repayment).

Our Treasury mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring we maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities,
the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close
out market positions.

Cash flow forecasting is performed by management of our operating entities which is consolidated by
our finance team. These rolling forecasts are monitored to ensure our cash and liquidity requirements
are sufficient to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn
committed borrowing facilities. This enables our management to monitor compliance with borrowing
limits and debt covenants on our borrowing facilities.

**_Capital Risk Management_**

Our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns to shareholders, benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Our loans and borrowings are considered the most
important item from a capital management perspective.

We are highly leveraged and our management’s focus is on cash generation. An important performance
indicator used in this respect is our cash conversion ratio. This focus should make it possible for the
Group to pay interest and repay its obligations as they become due.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management
to make judgments, accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgments are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are as follows:

- the impairment of goodwill;

- the impairment of trade receivables; and

- provisions; and

- fair value estimation with respect to financial instruments.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised if the revisions affect only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

A description of our accounting policies under IFRS is set forth on pages F-31 to F-43 of this Offering
Memorandum.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**Overview**

We provide a range of value added business solutions in a set of niche markets that focus on providing
professional and administrative business services in the areas of finance, law and human resources
services. These services help clients manage their international operations, their investments and their
related foreign legal entities. These services typically require specialized local expertise and the negative
ramifications of poor delivery, such as non-compliance with local regulations, can be significant in
relation to the cost of the services themselves. Unlike with some forms of business process outsourcing,
we believe that our clients’ key purchasing criteria are generally quality, expertise and responsiveness,
due to the Group providing services that rely on strong local knowledge and experience.

We believe that our primary markets benefit from a number of common structural growth drivers,
including growing usage of outsourcing, internationalization, increasing regulatory complexity and more
stringent reporting standards.

In our view, the growth of business services outsourcing reflects an increasing focus by organizations on
their core capabilities. External providers have the potential to offer cost savings and improved service
because of their specialized capabilities and higher scale. This is particularly the case for activities where
in-house provision would result in sub-scale operations or where limited internal institutional knowledge
exists, as is often the case for support functions in new geographic markets.

Industry expansion has also been driven by the internationalization of corporate and investment
activities. Moves by organizations from developed markets to take advantage of rapid economic growth
in emerging markets have helped stimulate growth. They are increasingly being supplemented by
activity from companies located in emerging markets that are looking to expand internationally.

Increasing regulatory complexity (especially with regards to tax) has also contributed to growth in the
provision of value added administration outsourcing solutions. Actions to increase compliance
requirements in industries where risk management has been perceived as weak, as well as initiatives to
create more nuanced regulatory regimes, have tended historically to more than offset initiatives aimed at
regulatory and legal simplification or international harmonization. This trend, in conjunction with the
move towards more demanding reporting requirements, we believe has increased the total volume of
administrative work and made it increasingly valuable for our clients to seek our specialized local
expertise.

Our markets involve a broad set of offerings to a diverse set of clients including multinational companies,
financial institutions, listed and large private companies, the managers of investment funds, high net
worth individuals and structured vehicles.

Broadly we operate in four markets: corporate services, structured finance services, fund administration
services and private client services.

We believe there is no global provider that competes with us across all of our services in all of our
geographies. Furthermore, although a number of other service providers cover one or more of our
service lines on a local or regional level, we believe that our broad geographic footprint of service
offerings differentiate ourselves from such competitors, as discussed further below.

**Corporate Services**

_Market Definition and Growth Drivers_

Our corporate services division operates within this market but focuses only on selected high value
added niche services. The core competencies that underpin the services we deliver to clients in our
currently addressed market niches include:

- financial, accounting, bookkeeping and reporting (including preparation of statutory accounts,
management accounts and company and consolidated financial statements);

- human resource and payroll outsourcing; and

- company secretarial and regulatory compliance outsourcing.

Market demand typically comes from a variety of companies using international subsidiaries to conduct
foreign commercial operations and companies establishing foreign entities in order to create more

78


-----

efficient overall corporate structures. The latter group would include, for instance, companies using
holding companies in the Netherlands to take advantage of Dutch tax treaties to avoid double taxation of
profits generated in their other subsidiaries.

On a macroeconomic level, corporate services activities generally tend to be positively impacted by
increased global GDP growth which creates conditions supportive of geographical expansion and
corporate structuring activity. Nonetheless, in our view, some of the activities in this market are less
subject to the potential for contraction in the event of reduced global GDP growth as certain key
administrative services such as accounting and bookkeeping will always need to be performed for
clients as long as they retain their existing foreign legal entities.

In terms of structural drivers, the corporate services market is impacted by the drivers discussed
previously in the context of the industry as a whole. The growth of outsourcing creates opportunities to
acquire new clients and also to increase the range of services provided to existing customers.
Internationalization leads directly to clients setting up new foreign operating subsidiaries, which can in
turn also trigger broader reorganization activity to optimize corporate structure. Increased regulatory
complexity is a key reason for companies seeking to reassess their corporate structures. Meanwhile,
financial reporting rules over the last decade have tightened as a result of changes starting with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States and continuing with the ongoing roll-out of corresponding
legislation in other jurisdictions. In addition to stimulating the need for increased financial reporting
activity, these rules have also encouraged the use of independent providers for certain reporting
functions and effectively exclude the ‘‘Big-Four’’ accountancy firms from providing certain services.

_Competitive Landscape_

Within the corporate services market we face competition from several organizations, but few are active
across the full range of services we offer. Larger accountancy firms or legal firms compete in a few areas
but are restricted from offering many services by conflicts of interest rules. Instead they often refer clients
to us in instances where they do not provide services directly.

Larger outsourcers (e.g. Tata Consultancy Services, Genpact or WNS) or payroll specialists (e.g. ADP or
Ceridian) compete for larger clients in some areas, but typically do so only for a subset of services we
offer and typically not across all of the jurisdictions that we serve.

We compete with a number of regional competitors who provide similar services to ours. These regional
competitors typically offer services that are tailored to the region in which they operate, but they lack our
global reach and hence cannot provide a service in all major geographic markets. Similarly, certain
operators work through a ‘franchise’ model whereby they may operate under a single brand, but either
deliver their services from off-shore locations from where they are incapable of delivering on specific
local presence requirements or through a network of ‘affiliates’ through which they are incapable of
providing consistent service or global coordination.

For smaller potential clients, the primary source of competition is from second tier or local accountancy
firms, payroll providers and legal firms. These competitors tend to compete on individual services in
single markets rather than being able to provide an integrated portfolio of services across multiple
jurisdictions.

Competitive dynamics are also influenced by the fact that any new competitors would face barriers to
entry created by the need for local expertise, the need for strong relationships (both in the local market
and with international business referrers), the importance of an established reputation and challenges in
winning customers from incumbents given the reluctance of clients to change providers once they have
established a working relationship.

**Structured Finance Services**

_Market Definition and Growth Drivers_

Structured finance services involve the provision of services such as incorporation of SPVs and the
administration, provision of directors and officers, financial reporting and management services to
structured finance transactions, relating to all forms of asset securitization, asset repackaging, aviation
finance and cross-border lease transactions.

Historically, activity in the market for structured finance services has centered around Collateralized
Loan Obligations (‘‘CLO’’). Following the financial crisis reduced investor appetite for these vehicles has

79


-----

resulted in a decline of the use of CLOs as financing vehicles. However, a market still exists for the
provision of services to existing CLOs as well as the broader set of structured transaction vehicles. Within
this market, increased regulation and transparency requirements, such as those brought in under the
E.U. Transparency Directive, are generating an increased need for supporting services. In the longer
term, demand for structured finance services will depend on how the CLO and broader securitization
market develops.

_Competitive Landscape_

Key competitors in the market include major investment banks, regional structured finance services
players and country focused securitization players. While we have serviced structures covering a range
of asset classes, when the markets are open for these products, we have had a strong focus on CLOs (as
well as CDOs and cash ABS transactions), which we see as one of our strengths in this area because
historically, major investment banks have focused on the structured product issuance and non-CLO
related deals.

**Fund Administration Services**

_Market Definition and Growth Drivers_

We operate in the market for provision of back office and administrative functions for a wide range of
investment funds primarily in the alternative asset management space (including hedge funds, private
equity funds and fund of funds). Services are targeted at the funds at the smaller end of the market and
include preparation of accounts, regular valuations, bookkeeping, corporate secretarial, position
reconciliation, shareholder services, management services and provision of information to investors.

As fees are often calculated as a percentage of assets under management (‘‘AUM’’), in addition to the
general industry wide trends, an important driver of the fund administration market is industry wide AUM.
Growth in AUM may be supplemented by a potential increase in the need for administrative services due
to growing compliance and transparency demands. The European Union’s proposed second Markets in
Financials Instruments Directive, currently passing through the legislative process, will require a review
of existing hedge fund disclosure and processes. Meanwhile recommendations from the Alternative
Investment Management Association and the International Organization of Securities Commission
suggest increased use of independent administrative service providers to perform tasks such as
valuation.

_Competitive Landscape_

The fund services market is generally very fragmented. While our global resources (particularly in
Ireland, Malta, the United States and Singapore) assist in efficiently servicing the needs of our fund
services business, this is not necessarily a competitive advantage for us as competition for mandates
tend to be localized by the country of origin of the relevant fund(s). Thus, in addition to competing with
the large investment banks and larger administrators such as State Street and Citco, we face strong
competition from mid-sized administrators such as Advanced Info Services and Amicorp, and
specialized local fund administrators that tend to be relatively small in size.

Thus, our fund services offering is relatively niche and has historically focused on administering small
funds or funds domiciled in the BVI, Malta, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Cayman Islands.

**Private Client Services**

_Market Definition and Growth Drivers_

We provide a range of non-advisory services to allow high net worth individuals to manage their wealth
through bespoke legal structures. These include reporting, compliance services and monitoring of
investment manager performance for family trust and associated corporate structures. Our focus is
typically on the upper end of the high net worth individual spectrum, to serve clients with advanced
structuring needs.

In addition to the general industry drivers applicable to all our markets, expansion of the private client
services market is affected by trends in the value of assets held by the high net worth individual segment.
In recent years high net worth individual wealth has been growing faster than GDP due in particular to the
increase in assets in Asia. According to external research from the Boston Consulting Group, the total

80


-----

wealth of individuals with between $1 million and $100 million in assets was approximately $42 trillion in
2011 and forecast to grow at a CAGR of 6% until 2016. Meanwhile, individuals with over $100 million in
assets were estimated to hold approximately $7 trillion and this amount is forecast to grow at a CAGR of
8%.

The level to which high net worth individual investors place their assets into complex structures,
depends upon a range of factors including regulatory and tax complexity, their financial sophistication,
the ability to preserve wealth in home jurisdictions given tax and political considerations and their level of
concerns about succession planning.

_Competitive Landscape_

We face competition from a range of firms including financial institutions such as private banks that may
offer their high net worth clients certain services for a very low fee as part of a broader client offering,
local and international accountancy firms and local and international legal firms. Competition varies
depending on the specific service offered by us, with many competitors focusing on advice rather than
competing with us on the full range of administrative services.

**BUSINESS**

We are a leading global provider of high value business services to clients operating and investing
globally. We focus on providing highly specialized and business-critical financial, legal and human
resource administrative services that enable our clients to operate their corporate structures, finance
vehicles and investment funds in different geographical locations. We operate from 116 offices in
82 jurisdictions across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. The range of services
covers:

- _Corporate services—integrated legal, administrative and accounting services for companies’_
operations from inception through day-to-day functions to liquidation;

- _Structured finance services—creating and administering financial vehicles for securitization_
transactions, structured asset leasing and project finance transactions;

- _Fund services—back office functions for a wide range of investment funds, including the_
preparation of accounts and daily NAV calculations; and

- _Private client services—administering corporate structures for high net worth individuals for wealth_
planning purposes.

Across our range of services, we offer our clients a core set of competencies that form the heart of our
product offering including:

- _Financial administrative services. We provide a range of financial, accounting and reporting_
services to assist our clients with their financial reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate
manner. We prepare statutory accounts to comply with local law requirements and offer
international management and consolidated reporting in accordance with major accounting
standards. We also provide assistance with the registration, recovery and compliance with VAT, IPT
and other indirect taxes. In addition, we provide investment fund clients with fund accounting and
valuation services.

- _Legal administrative services. We provide a variety of legal administrative services to our clients in_
connection with establishing and maintaining financing and holding companies and other
structures in compliance with applicable local laws. These services include establishing corporate
entities to serve as finance companies or as operating companies, as well as managing corporate
compliance procedures, such as organizing and recording board and shareholders’ meetings. We
also provide domiciliary and management services, as well as local representatives and directors
with the necessary expertise, required for clients to conduct business in a particular jurisdiction.

- _Human resource administrative services. We provide a wide range of human resource and payroll_
services, including payroll processing, management reporting and cost analysis and outsourced
human resource services. Our specialists can act as a client’s local human resources function,
preparing employment contracts and guidelines, providing employee training assistance and
securely maintaining personal confidential information.

Our service offerings enable our clients to focus on their core operations while we ensure that critical
local administrative functions, that clients may have less experience in providing, are performed to a high
standard. In doing so, we help our clients (i) gain access to specialized local knowledge, including
regulatory, tax and financial reporting expertise that would be challenging or inefficient to develop
internally, (ii) reduce the risks and distractions of managing complex accounting, legal and human
resource regulations in multiple countries, (iii) control costs by taking over the back office administration
and reporting functions of their international offices that are not large enough to justify the administrative
overhead, (iv) simplify operations by providing a single point-of-contact from anywhere in the world,
often resulting in increased transparency for our clients, and (v) execute globalization plans swiftly and
flexibly by using our worldwide network of local offices and experts to assist on administrative matters.

In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e401.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e108.9 million. A significant proportion of our overall revenue comes from our long-standing
clients. Our strategy for winning new business includes cross-selling and up-selling to these existing
clients, but it also focuses on building relationships with new clients across our business segments. In
the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, 78.1% of our revenue was generated from our corporate
services business segment, and 63.5% of our revenue was generated from our Benelux and EMEA
segments. Although a significant portion of our revenue is produced by our operations in Benelux, this

82


-----

revenue is generated by clients from all over the world seeking to use our services in the perceived tax
efficient jurisdictions of the Netherlands and Luxembourg to service their international corporate
structures. As a result, a significant portion of this revenue is not directly tied to economic activity in the
Benelux region. We plan to continue to expand our operations into new markets in the Asia-Pacific
region and the Americas through organic growth and acquisitions.

Across our range of services, we have a diverse client base that includes multinational companies of
varying sizes, insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private companies
as well as high net-worth individuals. Our clients include companies using international subsidiaries to
conduct foreign commercial operations, and foreign entities to create more efficient overall corporate
structures. As of March 31, 2014, we provide services to more than 36,600 client entities. Our client base
is relatively fragmented, with the largest 20 clients contributing less than 6% of our revenue in 2013. Our
client entity retention rate was approximately 85% in each of the years from 2011 through 2013 and in the
first three months of 2014, reflecting the largely recurring nature of our business, which we believe
makes our business generally less susceptible to global business cycles. Management believes that this
percentage of client entity retention understates our underlying client retention as a number of our client
entities (e.g. SPV financing entities) have a finite life and are replaced over time. Such replacements are
reflected as a loss of client entities (in calculating retention rates) even though we typically retain the
replacement business. A large proportion of our client base consists of long-standing clients and these
continuing relationships have been critical to our growth.

Our current global reach and breadth of expertise mean that we are one of the few business services
organizations able to offer clients global solutions while also being positioned as a neutral
execution-only service provider (meaning, we are not affiliated with an accounting, financial or law firm)
and thus do not have similar issues with being conflicted out of taking on new work. We believe that we
are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the growing opportunities presented by the globalization
of business and the growing trend of businesses outsourcing support functions.

**Strengths**

We believe that our success to date and our potential for future growth are primarily attributable to the
following strengths:

**_A Leading Provider of High Value Business Services with a Broad Geographic Footprint and Service_**
**_Offering_**

We are a leading global provider of high value business-critical financial, legal and human resource
administrative services with an established track record and strong reputation for delivering quality
service to our clients. In addition, we benefit from being a neutral, execution-only provider as we are not
affiliated with an accounting, tax, financial or law firm. Because we do not have such affiliations, we can
provide clients with a broad range of services that many international accounting and legal firms cannot
or do not offer due to conflicts issues.

We are able to offer our clients multiple competencies across several service areas in end-markets
around the globe. By comparison, many of our competitors do not offer all of our services or do not offer
services in all of the jurisdictions where we have a presence, either due to a lack of local expertise or
conflict of interest. We currently have 116 offices in 82 jurisdictions, including major developing markets
such as Brazil, India, Russia and China, which enables clients to conduct business globally using a
single service provider (as opposed to multiple service providers across different jurisdictions). This
provides us with the opportunity to service our clients as they expand geographically. For example, in the
event that a client wishes to expand its corporate structure or close and shift operations to a new country,
we are able to provide the same services across a number of jurisdictions while maintaining a
comparable quality of service. This gives us a significant advantage over competitors who lack this
global footprint (such as locally-operated accounting firms) when working with multinational businesses.

**_Local Expertise and Provision of Value Added Services_**

We offer a range of customized service offerings to help our clients manage various administrative,
corporate compliance and reporting requirements. Through our experienced global workforce, we
provide clients with access to local expertise across our offices, enabling them to operate their business
in many jurisdictions with confidence and we believe at a lower cost than if such businesses performed
those services on their own.

83


-----

We provide a range of financial, accounting and reporting services to assist our clients with their financial
reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate manner. We also provide non-advisory services to
our clients to establish and maintain financing, holding and other structures in compliance with
applicable local laws. We provide a range of flexible and scalable human resource and payroll services
at the local level in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These services cover numerous aspects of
employee-related administrative affairs, including payroll processing, management reporting and cost
analysis and outsourced human resource services.

The majority of the services we provide ensure that our clients’ administrative and financial processes
are compliant with relevant regulations. Thus, our services are critical to our clients from a financial,
reputational and risk management perspective. The effectiveness of our services depends on a
combination of local knowledge of relevant regulatory frameworks and expertise. Such a combination
can be costly for our clients to develop internally in each of their jurisdictions of operation and, frequently,
our clients do not have the local scale or desire to perform these functions themselves. Our services not
only generally reduce operating costs for our clients, but also typically reduce initial start-up costs
associated with entering a new jurisdiction, increase the speed at which our clients can set up new
subsidiaries and preserve operational flexibility by allowing our clients to scale their operations up or
down with greater ease. As a result, our services allow our clients to focus their resources on revenue
generating operations and reduce associated administrative, compliance and reporting expenses,
without sacrificing the integrity of such functions.

We believe the price we charge for the services we offer is often a lesser consideration for our clients,
given the potential impact to their business if there are errors or deadlines that are not met. This is
important to our continued success as we believe the key purchasing criteria for our clients has
historically been the quality of the service provided and our local knowledge and expertise. We believe
our clients’ satisfaction is evidenced by our high client entity retention rates of approximately 85% in
each of the years from 2011 through 2013 and in the first three months of 2014. We believe that this high
retention rate is also driven by the depth of our knowledge of our clients’ activities and the regions in
which we operate, which cannot be easily reproduced by potential new entrants in the market.

We are focused on winning business in the high value, expertise-reliant segment of the business
services market. We generally seek to avoid competing with the mainstream BPO service providers or in
standardized segments where services are commoditized and primarily driven by cost. By comparison,
we believe the competitive advantage of our financial, administrative and human resource administrative
services lies with the quality of work we can provide. Accordingly, instead of relying solely on cost
advantages, we rely on our skilled local specialists (many of whom have professional qualifications) and
a correspondingly strong reputation among existing clients and established service providers, such as
law, tax and accountancy firms (which we refer to as ‘‘business referrers’’), to foster client confidence in
our quality. We believe that this in turn has resulted in a significant source of client introductions which
we believe is difficult for new service providers to replicate.

**_Resilient Business Model Based on Stable Revenue Generation and Strong Cash Conversion_**

Once established, the services we provide to clients have historically had a high degree of predictability,
with macro-economic fluctuations in any particular country or globally generally having limited impact
on our clients’ requirements for our financial, legal and human resource administrative services or on the
number of existing structures that we service. For instance, many of our services, such as statutory
accounting and corporate filings by our clients, are legally required on an annual basis regardless of a
client’s overall financial or operational performance.

One of the advantages of our business model is that shorter-term macro-economic trends that are
detrimental to many other businesses can increase demand for our services. For example, while
businesses may seek to reduce overall headcount in a recession which can reduce demand for our
payroll administrative services in a given jurisdiction, a global business may seek to move this
headcount to a lower wage jurisdiction where we also provide payroll administrative services, or may
seek to otherwise adapt its corporate structure to changing economic conditions by expanding into new
markets. Such practices can result in an increase in demand for our corporate services.

Generally, our service contracts generate revenue based on either a fixed fee, an hourly rate, or both. We
have a relatively stable client base with client entity retention rates of approximately 85% in each of the
years from 2011 through 2013 and in the first three months of 2014, which reflects the largely recurring
nature of our business. This has historically resulted in generally predictable revenue generation that

84


-----

provides us visibility over a significant portion of our expected annual revenue at the commencement of
each financial year.

We also benefit from strong Cash Conversion, which was 99%, 101% and 92% in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively. We are a service-focused business with relatively limited need for land, plant or equipment
or, compared to more generic business process outsourcing providers, complex IT infrastructures and
we therefore have limited requirements for capital expenditure. We also have limited working capital
needs because our customer receivables are partially offset by advanced payments from customers.

**_Favorable Global Economic and Regulatory Trends_**

We expect that growth in our business will continue to be driven by the trend towards globalization,
exhibited by multi-national corporations expanding outside of their home jurisdiction. In expanding
operations globally, we believe that our clients and potential clients will likely increasingly rely on outside
service providers to deal with the global trend towards increasing regulation and an emphasis on
transparency of corporate and financial activities. We expect these trends to continue to support the
expansion of our business in the near- to medium-term. In particular, we expect to benefit from the
following trends:

- _Continued international expansion by businesses. The international expansion of our current and_
potential clients drives our business. As companies expand into new geographies, it is often easier
to engage us to provide administrative support so that clients do not need to invest in local
infrastructure (particularly where they are establishing only a small presence) and can instead focus
on their core business. Rising levels of foreign direct investment across international borders from
advanced economies to developing economies and between advanced and developing economies
in recent years has helped us expand our business, and we expect that this increasing globalization
will help us to continue to grow.

- _Increasingly stringent regulatory regimes. The global trend of increased regulation and_
enforcement thereof has emphasized the importance of local regulatory and compliance expertise.
The wide variety of local legal and regulatory requirements highlights the need for specific local
expertise, especially for businesses that lack the critical mass to obtain and maintain such expertise
in-house. Increasingly complex regulatory and tax environments and differing accounting
standards in individual geographies drive demand for our book-keeping and reporting services.

- _Increased transparency and independence. The recent economic crises have led to increased_
demand for transparency in accounting and reporting. For example, in our structured financial
services and fund services businesses, the demand for more current and accurate reporting as to
the performance of a structure or a fund, and demand for independence in administration of such
structures, has created increased demand for our services from our fund and structured vehicle
clients.

- _Evolving client needs. Our clients increasingly outsource non-core functions and demand global_
solutions for their outsourced administrative services needs. For example, it is easier, and we
believe often cheaper, for a client to engage a single reliable firm to perform their book-keeping,
local reporting and human resources administration services across a number of countries than to
engage different providers in each country.

We think our global network of offices provides an effective platform for capitalizing on these trends and
the scalability and resources to take advantage of growth in any particular market. We expect that these
trends will also attract new clients and provide us with opportunities to cross-sell to existing clients.

**_Diverse Customer Base_**

We have a diverse client base, including approximately 40% of the Fortune Global 500. Across our range
of services, we have a diverse client base which includes multinational companies of varying sizes,
insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private companies as well as high
net-worth individuals. As of March 31, 2014, we provide services to more than 36,600 client entities, with
the largest 20 clients contributing less than 6% of our revenue in 2013. We work with organizations
located in a broad range of geographies across a spectrum of industries, and we have formed
specialized teams with the necessary sector experience to ensure the continued quality of our service
offerings. This industry-focused approach has enabled us to offer a comprehensive suite of specific
tailored services to clients and to leverage these capabilities to win additional clients. For example, our

85

expertise in servicing a particular industry also enables us to develop client relationships that may
involve only a few tasks upon our initial engagement, but can later develop into a broader engagement
whereby we provide a client with new services or the same services in new jurisdictions.

**_Experienced Executive Management Team, with Incentives at Local Management Level to Grow_**
**_Our Business_**

We have a highly experienced executive management team at the global level with in-depth industry
knowledge. Our Chief Executive Officer, Hugo van Vredenburch, has over twenty years of business
experience and prior to joining us served as the Chief Executive Officer of Equity Trust, a position he held
from 2005, where he developed a detailed insight into our industry.

Gordon Stuart, our Chief Financial Officer and a qualified accountant, has significant outsourcing
industry experience, having worked with both private equity backed and publicly listed companies in this
sector.

In addition, our Chief Operating Officer, Frederik van Tuyll has served in significant management roles in
the sector. Mr. van Tuyll joined Equity Trust in 1994.

We provide management at the local level with incentives to continue to grow our business. We have
encouraged an entrepreneurial approach within our management, operating a relatively flat
management structure with managers across each of our regions and business lines reporting directly
to a regional director.

Our managers are incentivized and empowered to drive their individual businesses forward under
regional and central guidance from the Group on strategic directives and policies. In addition, our
management has a significant equity stake in the business, from the executive board to local
management teams. We believe this ensures that all levels of our management team are incentivized to
achieve our overall business plan.

**Strategy**

The key components of our strategy are as follows:

**_Continued Growth Through Penetration of Our Existing Client Base_**

We have a broad and diverse client base that includes many leading global corporations. We believe that
there are significant opportunities to provide additional services to our existing clients, and we intend to
leverage our extensive service range and expertise to cross-sell other services to our existing customers.
To that end, we created a global sales force that proactively manages client accounts and seeks to
broaden the array of services we provide to our clients. We also intend to continue to leverage our
international network to offer our services to clients in any jurisdiction where they do business. For
example, we provide administrative services in some countries where clients operate but not in others.
We intend to use our broad geographic footprint to provide our clients with a seamless service and
single point of contact wherever in the world they look to do business.

**_Further Growth of Our Network_**

Our growth strategy is based primarily on balanced organic growth. We intend to continue to expand our
operations in countries where we see compelling growth opportunities, such as the United States, Brazil,
Russia, India, China, Norway and Indonesia. We pursue organic growth by expanding the size of our
existing offices to service new clients, providing additional types of services, and opening offices in new
countries or expanding the number of our offices in a country. In the last twelve months, we have opened
new offices in Qatar and Canada. We typically open new offices when we have requests from existing
clients to provide services in new locations. These are often in locations where we have previously
referred client work to a third-party provider and have determined that future business prospects will be
sufficient to cover the costs associated with opening a new office. We intend to continue to increase the
scale of our global network through organic growth in regions where our existing clients are present and
where we see attractive opportunities to win new clients.

We may also expand our operations through acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. We have
grown our business in the past through acquisitions with a targeted and disciplined acquisition strategy
that we expect to continue to apply to make acquisitions going forward if suitable opportunities arise. In

86


-----

the final quarter of 2013, we acquired Accepta A.S., one of the Norway’s largest accounting groups. In
January 2014, we acquired the assets and liabilities of PT Tass Axia Solusi, an Indonesian company,
which expanded our presence in Indonesia. To expand our other fund services offerings, we also
acquired the non-controlling interest in the Custom House Group in January 2014, which was subject to
regulatory approval, which we received in the second quarter of 2014. In July 2014, we entered into the
Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 100% of the share capital of KCS,
an independent pan-Asian corporate services provider specializing in corporate accounting, corporate
secretarial and payroll services.

**_Expand Our Range of Services, Including Through Strategic Arrangements_**

We continually assess the range of services we offer to meet the diverse needs of our clients. We have
recently begun offering clients assistance with the registration, recovery and compliance with IPT and
other indirect taxes, including the payment and collection of refunds. We also now provide structuring
services for aircraft, vessel and other significant asset leasing arrangements, as well as royalty fee
administration, process agent services and loan agency services. We continually evaluate the market
demand for our services to determine whether there are additional opportunities for us to expand the
range of services we provide.

We are also focused on expanding our range of strategic arrangements where we can complement the
services being provided by other market participants. For instance, we have collaborated with a global
payroll services company to jointly bid for service contracts where our geographic scope and presence
in multiple markets can complement that global service company’s payroll services expertise. We
believe that such strategic partnerships can help us take advantage of opportunities where either our
geographic scope or broad service offering can complement the services of our partner to jointly serve
key clients on projects we might not otherwise be able to win individually.

**_Continued Integration of Our Global Network_**

Our business has evolved from a combination of separate businesses around the globe into a global
network of 116 offices in 82 jurisdictions. Due to the importance of local expertise and client contact, our
offices each have a local managing director that reports to their respective regional director. As our
business has grown, we have increasingly integrated the operations of our offices, implementing
group-wide strategies as well as a group-wide sales function, in an effort to realize the economies of
scale enabled by our expansion. We also seek to achieve efficiencies by leveraging group-wide
infrastructure for several key functions. We are continuing the integration of our IT infrastructure across
many of our offices, and our key business application now covers a large portion of our offices.

**History**

TMF was founded in 1988, primarily as a provider of high-quality domiciliary services to corporations,
initially offering services in five jurisdictions: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, the BVI and the
former Netherlands Antilles. From this base, we expanded both the service offering and geographic
scope of the business through a combination of acquisitions and organic expansion.

In the early 1990s, we opened an office in Bulgaria, our first venture into Eastern Europe, to benefit from
the expected economic growth in the region. Subsequently the company expanded throughout the
Central and Eastern European area with greenfield start-ups in Romania, Serbia and the Czech
Republic, supplemented by acquisitions of administrative divisions carved out from the ‘‘Big-Four’’
accountancy firms in Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and Slovakia.

In 2004, Silverfleet and our management team acquired the Group from SNS Reaal, providing us with an
opportunity to focus on structure and internal systems, which then enabled us to expand, through a
targeted buy-and-build strategy, into non-European markets. We rapidly developed from having a small
regional footprint to becoming one of the leading global financial and administrative business service
providers.

In 2008, we were acquired by current majority owner Doughty Hanson, with certain senior management
retaining a significant stake in the business. In 2011, Doughty Hanson acquired Equity Trust, a leading
provider of a range of administrative services to organizations worldwide, including corporate secretarial
and legal administration services, structured finance solutions, fund administration, complex private
client administration, and bookkeeping and accounting. At the time of the acquisition by Doughty

87


-----

Hanson, Equity Trust employed approximately 1,200 people in 40 offices across the world. Equity Trust
was subsequently merged with us with effect from January 1, 2011.

**Client Offering**

We provide highly specialized, individually tailored and business critical services to international
businesses to enable them to meet the complex administrative and corporate compliance requirements
of operating in different geographical locations. Our service offering is provided through four business
segments which comprise corporate services, structured finance services, fund administration services
and private client services, and with our vast network of offices around the globe.

It is our policy not to provide legal or tax advice (but rather to work with our clients’ external advisers or
their in-house professionals). For reasons related to, among other things, (i) client demand, (ii) size of
our office, and (iii) local regulations, we do not offer all of our services in every country in which we
operate. A detailed discussion of each business segment is provided below.

**_Corporate Services_**

Our corporate services segment provides companies with integrated legal administrative and
accounting services, providing expertise to facilitate operations and corporate compliance from
inception through day-to-day operations. This offering includes accounting, bookkeeping and reporting
services, company secretarial services, human resources and payroll services and specialist
administration and is offered globally. Our corporate services team comprises the following two
sub-segments: business services outsourcing and international structuring services.

In 2013, we generated e306.3 million of revenue from the corporate services business segment
(representing 77.2% of our overall consolidated revenue. In 2013, the division had 2,778 FTEs.

_Business Services Outsourcing_

Our business services outsourcing team focuses on providing the high quality non-advisory services
and support that are required to successfully conduct business abroad, in accordance with applicable
local laws. For example, rather than supporting financing or holding company structures, we provide
services to a client’s operating companies. The business services outsourcing team deals with matters
that may be categorized into the following sub-segments: accounting, bookkeeping and reporting
services, company secretarial and human resources and payroll services.

**_Accounting, Bookkeeping and Reporting Services_**

Our accounting, bookkeeping and reporting services team use their local expertise to assist business
with the management of their financial reporting in a transparent, up-to-date and accurate manner. Our
clients include large multinational corporations to businesses taking the first steps of international
expansion. Our global network of offices in 82 jurisdictions provides a complete range of financial,
accounting and reporting services, including:

commerce;

88

- _Group reorganizations—providing support in respect of either single company or group_
restructurings by undertaking all local authorization, registration and filing formalities. In addition,
coordinating and assisting with the reorganization of complex corporate structures with companies
in multiple jurisdictions;

- _Legal entity rationalization—planning and coordinating global legal entity rationalization projects_
which involves working with local specialists to assist clients in significantly reducing their on-going
compliance burden and associated costs/risks of maintaining redundant legal entities;

- _Secondments/interim_ _resources—providing_ secondments of corporate secretaries and
administrators with a broad range of knowledge and experience to temporarily address internal
resource constraints. Secondments can be made on a short or long term basis according to client
needs and the availability of our staff in local country offices;

connection with pre-IPO support for clients looking to list on recognized public markets, including
on the London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange; and

- _Process agent services—providing a local agent to accept service of legal process._

**_Human Resources and Payroll Services_**

Our human resources and payroll services team provides a wide range of flexible and scalable human
resource and payroll solutions. We can assist with implementing our clients’ international human
resource policies across all the territories in which we operate and ensure these meet all local legislative
requirements. Our specialists can act as the client’s local human resources function, preparing contracts
and employment guidelines, providing employee training assistance and securely maintaining personal
confidential information. In addition, we offer the following services:

- _Payroll—managing all aspects of the payroll process to ensure continuity and mitigate compliance_
risks. Our staff can calculate payroll and related tax payments in accordance with local rules and
complete the payments process on a client’s behalf (and provide related reporting to clients,
including social security and payroll tax filings and payments); and

- _Human resource materials/guidelines and outsourcing—assisting clients putting in place_
appropriate human resource policies and guidelines and, in certain instances, providing certain
local human resource functions.

_International Structuring Services_

Our international structuring services team provides a number of the same services offered by our
business service outsourcing team, but focuses more on providing the high quality non-advisory
services, infrastructure and support that are required by our major multinational, private equity, hedge
fund and other clients to establish (and maintain) financing, holding and other structures in jurisdictions
across the world. We also assist clients with ensuring that such structures comply with applicable local
laws and, where applicable, have a sufficient presence (physical and decision making) in jurisdictions
for commercial, tax or other purposes. For example, our international structuring services assists clients
with the services described above under ‘‘—Company Secretarial.’’

89


-----

Additionally, our business services outsourcing team offers the following services in a number of
jurisdictions:

- _Company representation services—providing attorneys-in-fact, proxy holders, bank signatories as_
well as qualified managing directors who assume sole or joint responsibility for the day-to-day
running of the client’s company. These services are rendered subject to certain risk management
procedures;

- _Escrow services—in certain jurisdictions, providing an escrow agent as well as assisting with the_
drafting of escrow agreements and opening and managing segregated escrow accounts, holding
and releasing funds according to the terms of an escrow agreement and investing the funds as
directed by the contracting parties and accounting for the source and application of the funds; and

- _Intellectual property licensing and collection—in a limited number of jurisdictions we provide_
services aimed at ensuring intellectual property assets are properly accounted for, managed and
protected, as well as collection account services which involve collecting, administering and
disbursing revenues from the global exploitation of, among other things, audio-visual works such as
films, television programs and video games.

A relatively standalone component of our internal structuring services is our international incorporation
division, which assists clients in establishing and registering entities primarily in the British Virgin Islands,
which is a popular jurisdiction for international incorporations.

The international structuring offering is available in so called ‘‘tax efficient jurisdictions,’’ where major
multinational, private equity, hedge funds and other corporate clients aim to mitigate their tax burden in a
legal and transparent way. For example, they do so by establishing and maintaining financing, holding
and other structures to benefit from relief from double taxation based on the relevant country’s taxation
and applicable double tax treaties.

**_Structured Finance Services_**

Our structured finance services segment facilitates the establishment and on-going operations of the
structured financial vehicles that are used in securitization transactions, structured asset leasing and
project finance transactions covering a wide asset class including mortgages, corporate and student
loans and credit card receivables.

In 2013, we generated e37.7 million of revenue from the structured finance services business segment
(representing 9.5% of overall consolidated revenue). The division had, in 2013, client entities in more
than 21 countries serviced by approximately 160 FTEs. The services of this segment are primarily offered
in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Argentina, Ireland,
Malaysia and Italy.

The structured finance services team’s role is purely administrative, so we have no economic exposure
to the value of the assets which are the subject of the underlying transactions/structures. In this regard,
we offer a broad range of SPV, trustee and ancillary services tailored to client requirements. These
include the following services, which are described in more detail above under ‘‘—Corporate Services’’:

- assistance with SPV incorporation;

- assistance with subscription and redemptions in the relevant financial vehicles;

- provision of qualified independent directors;

- accounting and consolidation services including the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the appropriate GAAP and IFRS requirements;

- corporate secretarial services;

- trustee services; and

**_Fund Administration Services_**

Our fund administration services segment establishes and manages back office functions and complex
fund administration functions covering day to day operations for a wide range of investment funds
(e.g. hedge funds, private equity funds and fund of funds), including the provision of independent, timely
and accurate NAV calculations to investors in funds.

In 2013, we generated e24.2 million of revenue from the fund administration services business segment
(representing 6.1% of overall consolidated revenue). This division had, in 2013, client entities in
approximately 8 countries serviced by 212 FTEs and the services of the segment are primarily on
offshore funds.

We administer a wide range of investment funds and other pools for collective investment. We offer fund
accounting and valuation services, custodian services and shareholder services all designed to mitigate
risks, optimize efficiency and give clients a strong competitive advantage. We work with many leading
independent money managers and family offices as well as funds of funds, banks and institutional funds.

current and potential investors have timely access to these valuations; and

audit preparation, administration of trading restrictions; and undertaking KYC service concerning
investors on behalf of the fund managers.

**_Private Client Services_**

Our private client services segment works, on a non-advisory basis, with clients’ legal, accounting and
tax advisers to execute the establishment and running of complex, bespoke structures for high net worth
individuals. Such structures are generally aimed at enhancing and protecting our clients’ wealth.
Services provided by this division include setting up, maintaining, and administrating family trusts,
estate planning and associated corporate structures.

In 2013, we generated e28.6 million of revenue from the private client services business segment
(representing 7.2% of overall consolidated revenue). This division had, in 2013, client entities in
approximately 13 countries, which were serviced by 188 FTEs. The services of this segment are primarily
offered in Jersey, Hong Kong, Cura¸cao, and the BVI, and a large portion of this revenue is driven by our
operations in Hong Kong and Jersey.

regulatory issues and plans for estate and business succession. We have the capabilities to establish

income tax; and

- _Implementing charitable structures—assisting the implementation of structures which facilitate the_
donation of money or goods to support a charitable cause or maintain philanthropic purposes over
the longer term.

**Clients and Marketing**

We offer our services predominately to multinational corporations that require assistance operating
outside of their core markets or to companies that may lack appropriate local resources to perform
functions that we provide. Many clients outsource their administrative functions at an early stage of the
entity lifecycle, and as the local entity builds up to sufficient staff numbers, clients may take work
in-house, leaving us with the value added services.

We use the following three core marketing channels:

- _Business referrers—We have an informal international network of referrers which refer business to_
us. We have developed relationships with a number of large accounting firms (as well as certain
smaller firms, with relationships typically held at the local level), law firms, tax advisors, investment
managers and investment banks who refer clients to us for the provision of services outside of their
core business or where they are conflicted from providing the service. While we sometimes
reciprocate the referral process, we believe that the core driver for such referrals is the desire of
business referrers to refer their clients to high quality service providers. As an independent provider,
we provide execution only services and therefore do not compete for the advisory services of our
business referrers.

- _Referrals from within the Group—A proportion of the new business acquired by us comes from_
cross-selling services to existing clients and clients recommending other new clients through word
of mouth. The requirements of individual clients tend to develop over time, giving us opportunities to
alter the scope of services provided or expand our services to a client’s operations domiciled in
different regions. To that end, we have a dedicated team responsible for boosting multi-geography,
multi-service contracts with clients.

- _Sales to new businesses—Our Sales team is responsible for the generation of leads through direct_
marketing and analyzing the existing client base. This process includes identifying and pursuing
leads concerning both potential clients and potential business referrers. Potential leads are
identified through the production and maintenance of internal databases as well as through utilizing
external sources of information.

Our marketing strategy involves leveraging our global footprint by the facilitation and cross selling of our
services. By targeting multinational companies, we are able to offer both existing services in new
geographies and new services in existing geographies.

**Client Base**

Overall, we have a diverse client base, including approximately 40% of the Fortune Global 500 and
provide services to insurance and real estate companies, financial institutions, listed and private
companies, private equity funds as well as private clients. Of these, we focus primarily on providing
services to multinational corporations.

Customer concentration in most individual geographies is low and diversified over a number of industry
areas. As at March 31, 2014, 15.2% of our clients were based in Benelux, 35.3% were based in EMEA,
20.7% were based in the Americas, 26.7% were based in Asia Pacific and 2.0% represent Fund services
clients.

The wide range of services and geographical spread provides us with a large and diversified client base
and client relationships that is in many cases long-term and highly stable. For example:

- _Corporate services—our clients range from large multinational corporates and financial institutions_
to private equity firms, pension funds and small companies expanding;

- _Structured finance services—we typically assists financial institutions (and their clients) in_
establishing and servicing these structures;

92


-----

- _Fund services—customers are typically fund managers; and_

- _Private client services—our customers include high (and ultra-high) net worth individuals and where_
we typically work closely with their accountants, lawyers, financial advisers, tax consultants or other
financial service providers.

Our revenue is generally derived from client engagements, typically based on an annual fee for the
agreed services plus an hourly rate for additional work undertaken. The exception to this is the fund
services division where revenue is linked to the amount of funds under administration (subject to a
minimum fee level). The annual fee element is a fixed fee which is often paid upfront resulting in a limited
history of fee arrears and strong Cash Conversion.

The majority of our clients either do not have long-term contracts with us, or have contracts that may be
terminated on short notice by the client. However, we believe that our depth of knowledge about each
client and the potentially high costs and execution risk of moving providers has resulted in historically in
generally high retention rates. Historically, the main reasons for client churn have been in-sourcing,
clients exiting the market or competition.

In our experience, our clients’ purchasing metrics have focused on quality, expertise and
responsiveness. Although price is a factor, we believe that it does not tend to be the key consideration
with established clients as long as the other metrics listed are sufficiently met. However, some aspects of
our offering are more price sensitive, such as our international incorporations division and private client
services where some competitors provide services as part of an overall package offering. Given the
importance of quality of service, established customers in our view appear to be less sensitive to price
since (i) a positive experience with us often mean clients continue operating with a trusted partner on
business critical activities, (ii) the average fees per client are low compared to the value of the corporate
structures and the fines resulting from errors or late filing, (iii) our depth of knowledge about each client
results in high switching costs and disruption of established working relationships, if clients were to
change providers, and (iv) business referrers suggest use of our services to their clients for
implementation of structures on which these business referrers are advising. Since the business
referrers could share any reputational consequence for a failure to deliver, they are incentivized to
ensure that the service levels are high rather than to be unnecessarily cost conscious.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Over the past several years, we made a number of acquisitions to either serve as bolt-ons to our existing
operations or as a platform into new territories or services within a country. We have an in-house team
that conducts comprehensive due diligence, and this work is supplemented by local external advisers
(to the extent necessary). We seek to quickly integrate new companies, once acquired, with the
assistance of its internal integration team. Our most significant acquisition in recent years was the
merger with Equity Trust in 2011. During 2012, the Group did not make any substantial acquisitions. In
the final quarter of 2013, we acquired Accepta A.S., one of the Norway’s largest accounting groups. This
acquisition further enhances our presence in Scandinavia. In January 2014, we acquired the assets and
liabilities of PT Tass Axia Solusi, an Indonesian company, which will further enhance the Group’s
presence in Indonesia. To enable us to fully integrate our fund services businesses in Custom House and
TMF, we also acquired the non-controlling interest in Custom House and TMF in January 2014.

In July 2014, we signed the Share Purchase Agreement for KCS.

**Properties and Offices**

We rent all of our offices worldwide (other than one building we own in Cura¸cao).

**KYC and Risk Management**

_KYC_

We adhere to strict KYC procedures. Robust acceptance procedures are in place which are managed
pro-actively by a specialized group compliance team. Our global compliance team coordinates with
local compliance officers within the Group regarding ultimate ownership, source and destination of
funds, purpose of the structure and the nature of the services as well as reputational and anti-money
laundering exposure when vetting a client for acceptance.

93


-----

The specialized group compliance team is located in Switzerland, thereby separating client acceptance
from revenue responsibility and new clients are signed-off by one of the Group’s senior management.
Switzerland brings along the benefits of political and economic stability, employees with experience in
client acceptance matters, security and high level of data protection and location in a country with a
reputable and professional financial sector.

A Group Compliance Officer oversees group-wide procedures for both the acceptance of new clients
and re-acceptance of existing clients and reports directly to the Head of Legal, Compliance and Risk/
General Counsel. In every country, there is a local compliance officer with a reporting line to our Group
Compliance Officer, who implement our group compliance procedures on a local level. They monitor
local compliance with the procedures and keep track of local regulatory or other compliance incidents.

Our Group Compliance Officer receives (i) monthly reports from the Local Compliance Officers who
implement group compliance procedures on a local level, and (ii) notifications (and/or updates) if certain
specified key issues arise or events occur. These reports are consolidated and sent to the operation
board monthly and the holding company board quarterly.

_Risk Management_

The monthly management reporting process, alongside internal and external audits, is an important risk
management tool. These risk management control systems include among others our code of conduct,
policies, manuals, handbooks and procedures on various subjects within the organization including
client handling procedures, ‘‘four-to-six eyes’’ principle (e.g. we aim for work to be reviewed by at least
one other person), whistle blower policy, regular internal audits either as a surprise visit or announced,
and comprehensive client acceptance and re-acceptance policies.

**Regulation**

We are subject to the oversight of 17 regulators in different jurisdictions. See ‘‘Regulation’’ for more
information.

Typically, we seek to employ qualified accountants, lawyers, bookkeepers, company secretaries and
business school graduates. Approximately 76% of our employees are categorized as fee earning (or are
client facing) and/or assist in the provision of services to clients.

Personnel costs have historically been the largest on-going expense for our business, representing
52.6% of Group revenues in 2013.

We believe that our highly qualified staff are recognized both internally by management and externally
by clients as a key differentiator in our service offering with a significant proportion of professionally
qualified personnel. We believe that the quality of our workforce is one of the strengths of the business
and a key differentiator in the market place. It is also an integral part of how we successfully manage and
operate our global model.

-----

We seek to actively attract and retain the best employees. By investing in talent and rewarding
excellence, we aim to create a dynamic and invigorating work environment which brings our employees
a high level of job satisfaction, and provide our employees with the following:

- challenging work in a meritocratic environment;

- ongoing professional development;

- secondment and relocation opportunities within our global network; and

- competitive salary and benefits package.

**IT Systems**

Other than our fund administration services, we are not heavily IT-reliant due to our value added
proposition being in bespoke, people-driven services rather than commoditized IT products. Historically,
we have grown without a complex IT platform.

**Litigation**

We are, from time to time, involved in litigation and other legal disputes related to our business, including
disputes arising where we have provided trustee, director (for example, where we provide directors or
legal representatives for corporate entities of our clients or structures they have established) or
administration services.

While we have insurance coverage that we consider appropriate with regard to the size and nature of our
operations, our insurance policies are subject to deductibles, limitations and exclusions, and
accordingly insurance may not cover all the costs of any litigation in which we are involved or may
become involved in the future.

In addition to potential damages and the costs of litigation, we could suffer reputational damage in
connection with any significant litigation, regardless of the outcome. In addition, any litigation may lead
to inquiries or an investigation from the regulator(s) in the relevant jurisdiction, and, depending on the
outcome of any such inquiries or investigation, could affect our relationship with such regulator(s) and
accordingly our regulatory status.

_On-going Litigation_

- Certain investors in property investment and development trusts and companies in respect of which
certain of our subsidiaries provided trustee, director and administration services in Jersey have
threatened legal proceedings and/or have filed complaints with the Jersey regulator against the
relevant Group subsidiaries. Additionally, a claim was filed commencing proceedings in Jersey in
December 2010 against two of our companies by the current trustee and manager of three
collective investment funds which invested in property development structures in respect of which
our relevant subsidiaries previously acted as trustee or manager. Subsequently in 2013, a
substantial number of investors independently commenced proceedings in England against three
Group subsidiaries—a large amount of the damages claimed in the UK proceedings is in relation to
the same claims made in the Jersey proceedings. The legal proceedings and the claims filed in
Jersey and England involve investors claiming losses of substantial sums of money in connection
with the underlying property investments in Eastern Europe. The claims allege breach of trust,
breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of our relevant subsidiaries. As set out
under ‘‘Regulation,’’ certain of our subsidiaries’ activities in Jersey are regulated.

The Jersey regulator is at an advanced stage of an investigation in respect of aspects of our Jersey
business relating to this matter and is currently in the process of forming its decision on any
appropriate action that arises from the investigation conclusions. The regulator could choose to
take enforcement action which could result in an adverse public statement, commencement of legal
proceedings for a compensation order against us or other regulatory sanctions. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Industry—We may be adversely affected by current,_
_potential and pending legal or administrative proceedings initiated, or to be initiated, against us and_
_any resulting judgments, settlements and orders rendered by competent authorities.’’ Unfavorable_
outcomes might include a material restriction or inability to conduct business in Jersey, or the need
for us to commit additional funding (or other form of Group support) to our Jersey subsidiaries. The
Jersey regulator has also commenced a related investigation into our Jersey subsidiaries.

- A subsidiary of ours acted as one of the directors of a Dutch holding company whose subsidiary
owned a Mexican property. Additional shares were issued by the subsidiary that resulted in the
dilution of the Dutch holding company’s (and its shareholders’) indirect interest in the Mexican
property. Legal proceedings were initiated in the Dutch Enterprise Chamber by one of the
shareholders in the Dutch holding company alleging mismanagement by all three of its directors
(only one of whom, as noted above, was a subsidiary of ours). The Dutch Enterprise Chamber found
that there was mismanagement on the part of all the directors. However, the Dutch Enterprise
Chamber is not a forum to claim such damages, and the relevant shareholder started civil
proceedings in the Netherlands against our subsidiary and the other directors to claim damages
(which damages still need to be substantiated). The plaintiff claimed funding for the civil claim by
bringing a related preliminary proceeding in the Netherlands, but this claim was denied by the
Dutch courts (in first instance and on appeal).

- We provided certain services in connection with a structured finance transaction, pursuant to which
receivables from a bank were transferred to a SPV managed and administrated by a subsidiary of
ours. The SPV issued notes to investors. The note trustee on behalf of the noteholders filed a claim
in Luxembourg against the relevant subsidiary of ours in November 2012 claiming that certain
formalities were not complied with in respect to the transfer of underlying assets as a result of which
the SPV might suffer a loss and cannot fully repay the noteholders. These proceedings are in the
process of being moved to LCIA arbitration in London with the consent of the parties to the
proceedings. The claim seeks damages in an amount of between approximately e125 million and
e143 million relating to the alleged lost value of the investment.

- The liquidators of an English company to which one of our Jersey subsidiaries had provided
directors and administration services (including as trustee of the Jersey trust that indirectly owned
the English company) served legal proceedings against its former directors and that Jersey
subsidiary. The primary asset of the Jersey company was a substantial London property. The legal
proceedings involve allegations of sale of the London property to a related entity at an undervalue,
failure to recover rent under an associated loan and authorizing the write off of a small loan.

- A subsidiary of ours acted as one of the directors (but not sole director) of an investment fund that
invested in life settlement policies and which it has been alleged has suffered certain losses. One of
the investors of this investment fund commenced court proceedings claiming that (among other
things) our subsidiary, as director of the funds, should be held liable for these losses—it is unclear
whether any other investors will join in these court proceedings.

While we cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing matters, based upon information currently
available to us and in light of our insurance coverage we do not believe that the final outcome of these
proceedings and any threatened proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

Additionally, we note that the headline figure of large claims against us is often based on the total loss to
investors in client structures, but historically any recovery from us has typically been at a much lower
level.

_Recent Claims and Notifications_

- One of our subsidiaries provided administrative services to a trust that is the issuer for a student loan
securitization program. The issuer issued notes to investors in order to acquire its receivables. Part
of the administrative services provided by our subsidiary is the calculation of interest to be paid to
the note holders based on the transaction documentation. An incorrect rate has been used, which
resulted in an overpayment of interest to the note holders. The issuer has filed a demand letter to our
subsidiary.

**REGULATION**

**General**

In 17 jurisdictions (‘‘Regulated Jurisdictions,’’ which are Argentina, British Virgin Islands, Cayman
Islands, Cura¸cao, Guernsey, Ireland, Jersey, Labuan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, the
Netherlands, Samoa, Singapore, Switzerland and Uruguay), certain of our subsidiaries are subject to
regulation (‘‘Regulated Subsidiaries’’). These Regulated Subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
provisions controlling their activities in the relevant jurisdictions and are subject to relevant regulations in
those jurisdictions. Regulations in various jurisdictions include periodic review, customer complaint
procedures, and other regulatory matters.

Such provisions require us to obtain authorization to perform business activities in or from that
jurisdiction. In six jurisdictions (Argentina, the British Virgin Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and
Singapore), we are subject to prudential supervision requirements, such as minimum capital, solvency
and liquidity requirements. In other Regulated Jurisdictions without such requirements, our Regulated
Subsidiaries are supervised primarily through regulation governing corporate integrity and rules on
accepting client business, including strict requirements to comply with sanctions and anti-money
laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws and regulations.

For Cyprus, an application for authorization with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission has
been made that is currently pending.

A discussion of the regulatory requirements applicable to us in some of our key markets is set out below.

**_British Virgin Islands_**

The British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (‘‘BVIFSC’’) regulates Class I Trust and
custodian activities performed by subsidiaries of our Group (‘‘BVI Regulated Subsidiaries’’) in the British
Virgin Islands. Failure to comply with the laws below may result in sanctions and fines or, in the case of
significant breaches, in limitations imposed on the activities of the BVI Regulated Subsidiaries, including
a loss of authorization which would render an entity unable to perform a significant portion of its business
in the country. The BVI legislature and the BVIFSC from time to time amend these laws and we monitor
such developments.

_Class I Trust activities_

Some of our activities in the British Virgin Islands include ‘‘Class I Trust activities.’’ Class I Trust activities
include serving as a trustee, administrator, manager, protector of a trust or engaging in settlement and
company management activities under the Company Management Act 1990. BVI Regulated
Subsidiaries performing Class I Trust Activities must obtain authorization from the BVIFSC pursuant to
the Banks and Trust Companies Act 1990, as amended (‘‘BTC Act’’). The BTC Act and associated rules
and regulations require the BVI Regulated Subsidiaries authorized as a Class I Trust entity to
demonstrate that:

- the management of the entity is ‘‘fit and proper,’’ that is, possessing honesty and integrity,
competence and capability, and financial soundness;

- the holders of a BVI Qualifying Holding are also ‘‘fit and proper’’;

- the entity carries out its trust business with appropriate restrictions, such as only providing trustee
services to a limited number of trusts; and

- the entity has not issued, transferred or otherwise disposed of a BVI Qualifying Holding, without the
prior written approval of the BVIFSC. See ‘‘—Vesting of Security Interests in Regulated Entities.’’

Additionally, Class I Trust entities are subject to a duty of ‘‘vigilance,’’ as defined in the Proceeds of
Criminal Conduct Act and associated rules and regulations (‘‘AML Act’’), requiring such entities to have
systems and policies that:

- determine or confirm the identity of customers requesting their services;

- recognize and report suspicious transactions to the designated reporting authority, as defined
under the AML Act (‘‘Reporting Authority’’);

- prevent a breach of the duty of confidentiality;

97


-----

- keep records for the prescribed period of time;

- train key staff;

- coordinate with the Reporting Authority and the Financial Services Inspectorate regarding the
entity’s compliance systems and policies; and

- ensure internal auditing and compliance departments regularly monitor the implementation and
operation of such systems.

A BVI Regulated Subsidiary should not enter into a business relationship or carry out a significant
transaction unless it has fully implemented these systems and policies. Moreover, the AML Act protects
any person who voluntarily discloses information to the Reporting Authority regarding a suspicion or
belief that certain money or other property represents the proceeds of criminal conduct.

The BVI Regulated Subsidiaries serving as trust offices are subject to a periodic review and on-site audit
conducted by the BVIFSC. The results of this review and audit are discussed at an annual meeting with
the Regulated Subsidiary. Additional meetings may be scheduled to discuss specific topics between the
BVI Regulated Subsidiaries and BVIFSC. Such additional meetings occur irregularly and depend on
developments and circumstances.

_Custodian activities_

We also provide certain custodian activities in the British Virgin Islands. Custodian activity which involves
the safe-keeping of investments, or the safe-keeping of any assets of a mutual fund, is regulated by the
Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (‘‘SIBA’’). Custodian activity which involves the
safe-keeping of bearer shares is regulated by the Financial Services Commission Act 2001 (‘‘FSC Act’’).
Custodian activity in respect of documents or assets which do not comprise either investments under
SIBA, are not held for mutual funds, or do not comprise bearer shares under the FSC Act are not subject
to regulatory oversight by the BVIFSC in their own right. BVI Regulated Subsidiaries are not licensed to
provide custody services under SIBA and do not presently provide such services. Certain BVI Regulated
Entities, such as TMF (B.V.I.) Limited, do provide custody services in respect of bearer shares and are
appropriately authorized under the FSC Act to do so. Certain BVI Regulated Subsidiaries also provide
custodian activities in respect of assets not expressly subject to regulatory oversight. TMF (B.V.I.)
Limited implements regulations governing custodians of bearer shares for entities owned by a thirdparty and is required to satisfy the BVIFSC that it meets certain ‘‘fit and proper’’ criteria and has the
necessary systems in place for the safe custody of bearer shares. In practice TMF (B.V.I.) Limited and
other BVI Regulated Entities extend these systems and controls and in certain circumstances conduct of
business measures in relation to other assets under custody, even though such assets in their own right
may fall outside of the scope of the regulatory regime.

**Luxembourg**

Some subsidiaries of our Group provide certain regulated services relating to trust offices and fund
services. In Luxembourg, certain services performed by our Group through TMF Luxembourg S.A., TMF
Compliance (Luxembourg) S.A. and Custom House Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A. are regulated
pursuant to the Luxembourg law of April 5, 1993, as amended, on the financial sector, as amended
(‘‘Luxembourg FS Act’’). Failure to comply with the Luxembourg FS Act and associated rules and
regulations may result in criminal and administrative sanctions and fines and in the case of significant
breaches, may result in limitations on the activities of or loss of authorization by the Luxembourg
Regulated Subsidiaries, resulting in an inability to perform a significant portion of their business in
Luxembourg. The Luxembourg FS Act and associated rules and regulations are from time to time
amended and the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries monitor such developments.

_Trust offices_

Our office functions in Luxembourg include the performance—on its own behalf or on behalf of third
parties—of the activities of corporate domiciliation agent, professional providing for company formation
and management services, family office, registrar agent, financial sector administrative agent and client
communication agent.

98


-----

_Funds services_

Our fund services offered to our clients in Luxembourg include several regulated activities pursuant to
the Luxembourg FS Act (i.e. registrar agent, corporate domiciliation agent, client communication agent,
administrative agent of the financial sector, company formation and management services). Custom
House Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A. is authorized to provide administrative services for clients and
execute financial instruments as well as act on behalf of numerous financial institutions including, inter
alia, credit institutions, professionals of the financial sector, insurance and reinsurance companies and
investment funds under Luxembourg and foreign law. Custom House Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A.
is permitted to maintain or destroy confidential documents, transmit documents or information relating
to client assets and services, manage mail granting access to confidential data, and consolidate
financial positions held with different financial institutions.

_Other_

The Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries are required to comply with inter alia, the following prudential,
organizational and audit rules provided by the Luxembourg FS Act:

- to have sound administrative and accounting procedures, control and safeguard arrangements for
electronic data processing, and adequate internal control mechanisms including, in particular, rules
for personal transactions by its employees;

- to arrange for records to be kept, and retained for periods laid down in the Luxembourg Commercial
Code, of transactions executed which shall at least be sufficient to enable the CSSF to monitor
compliance with the prudential rules which it is responsible for applying;

- to be structured and organized in such a way as to minimize the risk of clients’ interests being
prejudiced by conflicts of interest between the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary and its clients or
between one of its clients and another;

- comply with minimum share capital requirements which, in connection with the different
authorizations granted to the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries, should amount at all times to at
least e125,000;

- to communicate to the CSSF the identities of the shareholders or members, whether direct or
indirect and whether natural or legal persons holding Luxembourg Qualifying Holding in the
Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary authorized, and of the amounts of those Luxembourg Qualifying
Holdings and to inform the CSSF of any intended change in such direct or indirect control or holding
of the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries as described below;

- to have the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary’s annual accounts audited by one or more approved
statutory auditors who can show that they possess adequate professional experience. Those
approved statutory auditors shall be appointed by the management body of the Luxembourg
Regulated Entity;

- disclosure of the formal and factual holdings and control in the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary.

Any natural or legal person who has taken a decision to dispose, directly or indirectly, of a Luxembourg
Qualifying Holding in a Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary shall first notify in writing the CSSF, indicating
the size of its intended holding. Such a person shall likewise inform the CSSF if it proposes to reduce its
qualifying holding so that the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held by him would fall below
20%, 33[1]⁄3% or 50% or so that the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiary would cease to be its subsidiary.

In addition, Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries are bound to comply with the professional obligations
set forth in the Law of November 12, 2004 on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing,
as amended (‘‘Luxembourg AML/CFT Law’’), including inter alia the obligation to: (i) conduct customer
due diligence (for both new and existing clients, as appropriate) and (ii) possess adequate internal
organization; and (iii) co-operate with authorities.

The Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries have reporting obligations pursuant to the Luxembourg FS
Act. They may be subject to reviews and on-site audit processes conducted by the CSSF to verify their
compliance with applicable laws, regulations and circulars. In case specific topics must be discussed
between the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries and the CSSF further meetings may be scheduled.
Such further meetings occur irregularly depending on the developments and circumstances arising out
of the business of the Luxembourg Regulated Subsidiaries.

**The Netherlands**

In the Netherlands, subsidiaries of our Group (‘‘Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries’’) provide certain
regulated services, which are regulated and subject to supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (‘‘DCB’’)
and the Authority Financial Markets (‘‘AFM’’). Failure to comply with Dutch laws and regulations may
result in administrative sanctions and fines or, in the case of significant breaches, may result in limitations
on the activities of or loss of authorization by the Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries, including the inability to
perform a significant portion of their business in the Netherlands. The Dutch legislator, DCB and AFM
occasionally amend the Act on Supervision of Trust Offices (‘‘ASTO’’), the Dutch Act on Financial
Supervision (‘‘AFS’’), and associated rules and regulations. The Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries monitor
such developments.

_Trust offices_

Our trust offices activities include acting as statutory director for client companies and domiciliation
services combined with (i) corporate secretarial assistance, (ii) preparing tax returns, (iii) preparing
annual accounts and bookkeeping, (iv) recruitment of statutory directors for client companies, or
(v) other miscellaneous related services or a combination of all or some of the above services; sale and
intermediation of companies; and use of an entity to set up and administer special purpose vehicles.

Subsidiaries acting as a trust office in the Netherlands must obtain a license from the DCB pursuant to
the ASTO. The ASTO and associated regulations require that Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries authorized
as a trust office must:

- ensure all executive directors, non-executive directors, and factual policy makers are ‘‘fit and
proper’’ (i.e. trustworthy and suitable) prior to their appointment, subject to on-going monitoring by
the DCB;

- ensure that any individual or entity, whether residing or established in the Netherlands or abroad,
obtains prior approval for the acquiring or maintaining of a position of a Dutch Qualifying Holding in
such Dutch Regulated Subsidiary;

- ensure that any change to the de jure and de facto control structure of the group of companies
within which such Dutch Regulated Subsidiary is an affiliate obtains prior approval from the DCB;
and

- conduct business in accordance with the provisions on integrity in operations and administration as
well as the requirements regarding administrative organization and internal control.

Trust offices regulated pursuant to the ASTO are ‘‘institutions’’ under the Act on prevention of money
laundering and counter terrorism finance (‘‘Dutch AML Act’’). Thus, the Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries
must:

- perform a customer investigation on all clients (either a ‘‘simple’’ or ‘‘extensive’’ investigation,
depending on the profile of the potential client) of the trust office prior to an agreement to provide
services;

- perform an investigation on all Ultimate Beneficial Owners (‘‘UBO’’) of customers prior to an
agreement to provide services if the holdings of the UBO exceed 25%;

- monitor transactions by or on behalf of the customer; and

- report ‘‘suspicious’’ transactions to the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit.

Trust offices must comply with the Dutch Sanctions Act, requiring trust offices—in addition to their
obligations under the Dutch AML Act—to screen potential customers and transactions. In particular, the
screening must rely on information in the European Screening Lists published by national and
international counterterrorism authorities.

The Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries serving as trust offices are subject to an annual review and on-site
audit conducted by the DCB. The results of this review and audit are contained in the DCB’s annual
documents to the management of the Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries and are also discussed at an annual
meeting. Additional meetings between the Dutch Regulated Subsidiaries and the DCB may be
scheduled to discuss specific topics. Such additional meetings occur irregularly and depend on
developments and circumstances. Significant changes in our business as a whole are often scheduled

100


-----

to be discussed with the DCB which acts (informally) as the lead regulatory authority for all Regulated
Subsidiaries in our business worldwide.

_Custodian activities_

Three of our subsidiaries, TMF Bewaar B.V., Administratiekantoor van de Twentsche TrustMaatschappij B.V. and TMF Depositary N.V are engaged in custodian activities which include custodian
services for third-party collective investment funds. These subsidiaries performing such custodian
services need not obtain a permit but are subject to indirect screening by the AFM as soon as they notify
to the AFM that they are a depositary of a collective investment fund. TMF Bewaar B.V. and
Administratiekantoor van de Twentsche Trust-Maatschappij B.V. have been subject to such screening
processes by the AFM in the past pursuant to the Dutch legislation applicable to collective investment
funds prior to the introduction of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011/61/EU (the
‘‘AIFMD’’). TMF Depositary N.V. is currently the subject of a screening by the AFM as a custodian
performing services pursuant to an agreement with an AIFMD-fund manager. Pursuant to the applicable
laws for custodians prior to and after the AIFMD provisions entered into force, custodians must comply
with certain rules under the AFS including disclosure requirements towards the fund managers and
(indirectly) to the AFM. The AFS and associated regulations require, inter alia, that the Dutch Regulated
Subsidiaries acting as a custodian must:

- maintain a minimum capital of e112,500;

- ensure that day-to-day policymakers and members of the supervisory board (if any) are ‘‘fit and
proper’’ (i.e. trustworthy) prior to their appointment, subject to on-going monitoring by the AFM;

- disclose the de jure and de facto control structure of the group of companies within which the
custodian is an affiliate;

- comply with certain mandatory liability regimes depending on the type of assets held in custody;

- comply with certain duties depending on the type of assets held in custody such as, but not limited
to, safekeeping, registration, verification and/or monitoring of these assets held in custody;

- maintain independence from the collective investment fund managers;

- possess asset segregation rules and procedures protecting the interests of the participants in the
collective and investment schemes where the Dutch Regulated Subsidiary serves as a custodian;
and

- file an annual, audited account to the AFM and the public of the Dutch Regulated Subsidiary’s
actions as a custodian no later than four months after the end of the financial year.

**Change of Control in Regulated Subsidiaries**

Our Regulated Subsidiaries must obtain clearance of its direct or indirect transactions resulting in
change of control. Most Regulated Jurisdictions subject direct or indirect controllers in businesses to the
recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (‘‘FATF’’) and the RBA Guidance for Trust and
Companies Service Providers (‘‘TCSPs’’) of June 17, 2008 issued by the FATF (‘‘RBA Guidance’’). The
FATF promotes risk-based approaches for financial businesses and designated non-financial
businesses and professions. Some Regulated Jurisdictions have opted for a different risk-based regime
that requires regulatory agencies be notified of significant changes in direct or indirect control. Other
Regulated Jurisdictions have stricter requirements in place.

With the exception of one Regulated Subsidiary in Malta and one Regulated Subsidiary in Ireland, all of
the other Regulated Subsidiaries qualify as TCSPs and are therefore subject to the RBA Guidance. In
Malta, one subsidiary is designated as an ‘‘investment firm’’ under Directive 2004/49/EC and, therefore,
is subject to regulations adopted for financial sector businesses. Similar provisions apply for the Irish
Regulated Subsidiary. These regulations include, inter alia, Directive 2007/44/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of September 5, 2007 amending Council Directive 92/49/EEC and
Directives 2002/83/EC, 2004/39/EC, 2005/68/EC and 2006/48/EC, which provide for procedural rules
and evaluation criteria for the assessment of acquisitions and increases in holdings in the financial
sector.

Entities regulated in the British Virgin Islands, Cura¸cao, Guernsey, Luxembourg, Jersey, Malta, the
Netherlands and Singapore must obtain prior approval or comparable authorization for any change of

101


-----

control or the acquisition, disposition or increase of a significant interest (direct or indirect) in a
Regulated Subsidiaries. Thus, the Group or the relevant subsidiary customarily applies for such
approval or authorization every time it contemplates a direct or indirect change of control of a Regulated
Subsidiary in such a jurisdiction. For all other Regulated Jurisdictions, the Group provides regulatory
agencies with elaborate notifications containing the details of the direct or indirect changes in control of
the Regulated Subsidiaries concerned if and to the extent such direct or indirect change of control
affects the Regulated Subsidiaries in the jurisdictions concerned.

**Vesting of Security Interests in Regulated Entities**

The Collateral that secures the Notes includes pledges of shares in some of our Regulated Subsidiaries.
Regulatory approval would be required to enforce security interests in shares of Regulated Subsidiaries
in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risk Relating to the
_Notes—The rights of the Security Agent to enforce security over the shares of a regulated entity are_
_subject to prior regulatory consent in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands.’’_

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our_
_indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference_
_to, the underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this Offering Memorandum or unless the_
_context otherwise requires, terms defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor_
_Agreement shall have the same meanings when used in this section._

**Revolving Credit Facility**

**_Introduction_**

On the Issue Date, TMF Group Holding B.V. entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (the
‘‘Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’’) with, among others, HSBC Bank plc as Facility Agent and
HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited as Security Agent.

The Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a revolving facility of up to e70 million, which may
be used for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group including towards
financing Permitted Acquisitions and costs and expenses in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Notes but not for repaying, purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Notes or payments of any
interest or payment of any dividend, redemption or other distribution in respect of share capital. The
revolving credit facility is available for cash drawings, ancillary facilities, letters of credit or bank
guarantees.

The maximum aggregate base currency amount of all letters of credit or guarantee shall not exceed
e35 million.

**_Repayments and Prepayments_**

The Revolving Credit Facility has a final maturity date of 5.5 years from the Closing Date. Any amount still
outstanding at that time will be immediately due and payable.

Subject to certain conditions, any borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility may voluntarily prepay
the utilizations and we may permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility in a minimum amount of e1 million by giving 5 business days’ (or such shorter
period as the required majority of lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement agree) prior
notice to the Facility Agent.

We may reborrow amounts repaid, subject to certain conditions, until one month prior to maturity.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayment (or,
as the case may be, an offer to do so) in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- with respect to any Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility, if it becomes unlawful for such Lender
to perform any of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or to maintain its
participation in any utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility;

- with respect to any Lender which has issued a letter of credit or guarantee (an ‘‘Issuing Bank’’), if it
becomes unlawful for such Issuing Bank to leave outstanding any such letter of credit or guarantee;

- if a Lender so requires in respect of that Lender’s participation in outstanding utilisation, upon a
‘‘Change of Control’’ (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’’);

- upon an ‘‘Asset Sale’’ (as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and replicated in the
Indentures governing the Notes; and

- upon certain ‘‘Notes Purchases’’ (as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

In addition, there is an annual clean down obligation which requires that, at least once in any financial
year, the total amount of loans drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (excluding those
loans applied directly towards acquisitions permitted by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), less
cash and cash equivalents, must not exceed e5 million for a period of five successive business days.

112


-----

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR plus certain
mandatory costs and a margin of 4.00% per annum. The margin may be reduced by reference to
Adjusted Leverage (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility).

We are also required to pay a commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, on available but unused
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin. We are also
required to pay customary fees including commission on letters of credit, fronting fees and fees in
connection with ancillary facilities.

We were required to pay an initial arrangement fee and are required to pay certain fees to the Facility
Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

We and certain of our subsidiaries are original borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors subject to limitations imposed by
applicable law, and (subject to certain agreed security principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) secured by the same collateral as for the Notes as set out under ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Security’’ save as for the Spanish law pledges granted in favor of the Security Agent by_
(i) TMF Spain, S.A. and TMF Holding International B.V. over the shares of TMF Management (Spain), SL,
TMF Sociedad de Participaci´on, SL, TMF Sociedad de Direcci´on, SL, TMF Participations Holdings
(Spain), SL and TMF VAT & Fiscal Representation Services Spain, SL; and (ii) TMF Group Invest Two B.V.
over the shares of TMF Management Holding Spain, S.L., which only secure the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral will be
applied in or towards repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority hedging obligations
(if applicable) in priority to repayment of the Notes.

The provision and terms of the Collateral are subject to certain limitations and to the requirements of
applicable law and regulations. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Fraudulent conveyance
_and the laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_Collateral.’’_

**_Representations_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires all or certain of the borrowers, guarantors and
members of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) thereunder to make a
number of customary representations, some of which are required to be repeated on the first date of
each interest period, the date of each utilization request, each utilization date and each date on which an
additional obligor accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary positive and negative covenants (including
restrictive covenants that largely replicate those contained in the Indentures governing the Notes),
subject to certain agreed exceptions.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Restricted Group to comply with a financial
covenant calculated by reference to the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Adjusted Consolidated
EBITDA for the 12 month period ending on the relevant calculation date. The ratio is based on the
definitions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the
Indentures and the definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, each set of financial statements provided by us under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement includes a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement sets out customary events of default in relation to the Revolving
Credit Facility, the occurrence of which would, subject to any applicable grace periods, cure rights and
agreed exceptions, allow the Lenders of the Revolving Credit Facility to accelerate all outstanding loans

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is governed by and construed in accordance with English law although the
restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility and largely replicate those
contained in the Indentures governing the Notes, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indentures, the Issuer, the direct
shareholder of the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer entered into the
Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘RCF Lenders’’); (ii) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as counterparties to certain other hedging agreements (collectively, the ‘‘Hedging

Hedging Agreements are referred to in such capacity as the ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’); (iii) the Trustee,
on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Senior Secured
Noteholders’’); (iv) the Trustee, on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior Notes (the ‘‘Senior
Noteholders’’ and together with the Senior Secured Noteholders, the ‘‘Noteholders’’); (v) the Creditor
Representatives (as defined below); (vi) intra-group creditors and debtors; and (vii) the direct and/or
indirect shareholder of the Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer has or may incur in
the future (including the shareholder loans).

The Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee
under the Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture are
each referred to in this description as a ‘‘Debtor’’ and are referred to collectively as the ‘‘Debtors.’’ In this
description ‘‘Group’’ refers to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, ‘‘Indenture’’ refers to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture and ‘‘Note’’ refers to the Senior Secured
Notes or the Senior Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

114


-----

- the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- turnover provisions; and

- when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction
security (the ‘‘Collateral’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by
the Issuer and the Guarantors that is permitted by the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes and be secured by
the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, such debt being ‘‘Pari Passu
Liabilities’’ and the creditors of such debt being ‘‘Pari Passu Creditors.’’ The Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the creditors of any credit facility constituting a Credit Facility under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture shall be entitled to receive priority in respect of receipt of distribution of the proceeds of
the enforcement of Collateral (each such facility and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the
‘‘Credit Facilities’’ and each finance document relating thereto, a ‘‘Credit Facility Document’’). Each
lender of a Credit Facility is a ‘‘Credit Facility Lender’’ and the liabilities of the Debtors to the Credit
Facility Lenders are the ‘‘Credit Facility Lender Liabilities.’’ The Intercreditor Agreement allows for a
refinancing in full or in part of the Senior Secured Notes and/or a refinancing of the Revolving Credit
Facility.

The provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement override anything in the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Indentures to the contrary. By accepting a Note, Noteholders shall be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge you to
read that document because it, and not the description that follows, defines your rights as Noteholders.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted payments
described below, that the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and the liabilities of the Debtors under the
Hedging Agreements (the ‘‘Hedging Liabilities’’) (and in respect of Hedging Liabilities which relate to
currency or interest rate hedging in relation to any secured obligations, in each case to the extent
permitted to receive, or not prohibited from receiving, priority as to the receipt of distributions of
proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral by each of the Debt Documents (the ‘‘Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities,’’ and together with the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’)), the
Pari-Passu Liabilities, the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of the Notes (the ‘‘Notes Liabilities’’), the
liabilities of the Debtors to the Trustee (as trustee in connection with the Senior Secured Notes, the
‘‘Senior Notes Trustee Liabilities’’ and as trustee in connection with the Senior Notes, the ‘‘Senior
Secured Notes Trustee Liabilities’’ and together with the ‘‘Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities,’’ the
‘‘Trustee Liabilities’’), the liabilities of the Debtors to the Creditor Representatives (the ‘‘Creditor
Representative Liabilities’’), the liabilities of the Debtors to the Security Agent (the ‘‘Security Agent
Liabilities’’) and certain other unsecured liabilities will rank in right and priority of payment in the following
order:

- first, the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee Liabilities, Senior Notes Trustee Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities and the Security Agent
Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them;

- second, the Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities _pari passu and without any preference between_
them;

- third, certain intra-company obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (the ‘‘Obligors’’) to the
Issuer and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities’’) and without any preference between them;
and

- fourth, shareholder liabilities (which consists of liabilities owed by any Obligor to any shareholder,
direct or indirect, of the Issuer) (the ‘‘Shareholder Liabilities’’ and together with the Intra-Group
Liabilities, the ‘‘Subordinated Liabilities’’).

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the security
provided by the Debtors and the other parties for the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Hedging
Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities and the Security Agent Liabilities (together the
‘‘Secured Liabilities’’) will rank and secure all such liabilities pari passu and without any preference
between them except for the Spanish law pledges granted in favor of the Security Agent by (i) TMF
Spain, S.A. and TMF Holding International B.V. over the shares of TMF Management (Spain), SL, TMF

Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Senior Notes
Documents); or (f) the payment is of costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in
respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Senior Notes in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Credit Facility, the Senior Notes Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt
Document.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments from time to time when due to lenders owed any
Intra-Group Liabilities (‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities Payments’’) if at the time of payment no acceleration event
has occurred in respect of a Credit Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities (an

Group’’), (ii) after the Secured Liabilities Discharge Date but prior to the date on which all Senior Notes
Liabilities are discharged (the ‘‘Senior Notes Liabilities Discharge Date’’), the Senior Notes Trustee

116


-----

consents to that payment being made or (iii) that payment is made to facilitate payment of the Secured
Liabilities.

Payments may not be made on Shareholder Liabilities at any time unless the taking or receipt of that
payment is, following an insolvency event of any member of the Group, the exercise of any right of set-off
or to take or receive any payment in respect of Shareholder Liabilities of that member of the group.

**_Senior Notes enforcement restrictions_**

Until the Secured Liabilities Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of the Instructing Group, no
Senior Noteholder or Senior Notes Trustee shall take or require the taking of any enforcement action in
relation to the Senior Notes Guarantees except if a Senior Notes Default (the ‘‘Relevant Senior Notes

may refrain from acting in accordance with instructions from any other person to enforce the Collateral
until it is indemnified by the relevant creditors and provided that those instructions are inconsistent with
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Limitation on Enforcement by Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors_**

If either those Super Senior Creditors (as defined below) whose super senior credit participations
aggregate more than 66[1]⁄2% of the total super senior credit participations (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior
Creditors’’) or those creditors of Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes
Creditors’’), the Pari Passu Creditors and the Hedge Counterparties (other than to the extent of their
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities) (together, the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors’’) (excluding any Hedge
Counterparty in respect of its Hedging Liabilities) whose senior secured credit participates aggregate
more than 50% of the total senior secured credit participations (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’)
wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence enforcement of any Collateral, such group of creditors

117


-----

must deliver a copy of the proposed instructions as to enforcement of any Collateral (the ‘‘Enforcement
Proposal’’) to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representatives for each of the creditors of the Super
Senior Liabilities (the ‘‘Super Senior Creditors’’) and/or the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative (as appropriate) at least 10 business days prior to the proposed date of issuance of
instructions under such Enforcement Proposal (the ‘‘Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date’’).

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement
instructions (which includes a failure by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes Required
Holders or the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders to give any instruction), then the Security Agent will
promptly notify the relevant Creditor Representatives and such Creditor Representatives will consult with
each other and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 20 days (or such shorter period as the
relevant Creditor Representatives may agree) (the ‘‘Initial Consultation Period’’) from the earlier of (i) the
date of the latest such conflicting Enforcement Proposal and (ii) the date falling 10 business days after
the date the first Enforcement Proposal is delivered, with a view to coordinating instructions as to
enforcement of the Collateral.

The Creditor Representatives will not be obliged to consult as described above if:

(i) the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event;

(ii) a period of not less than six months has elapsed since the Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date
and no enforcement is being effected by the Security Agent; or

(iii) the Creditor Representatives agree that no Consultation Period is required or agreed to a shorter
consultation period.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Collateral in a manner which is not consistent with
certain Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to below), the relevant Creditor Representatives
shall give notice to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors, the Pari Passu
Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes (as appropriate) after which the Creditor Representatives for the
other Super Senior Creditors, the Pari Passu Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes shall consult again
with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor
Representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such
Creditors Representative shall not be obliged to consult again more than once in relation to each
enforcement action and shall not be obliged to consult in any of the circumstances described in
paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) of the previous paragraph.

The Instructing Group may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with certain security
enforcement principles (the ‘‘Security Enforcement Principles’’), including that:

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Collateral to be in accordance
with the Security Enforcement Objective (being to maximize so far as is consistent with prompt and
expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery by the Super Senior
Creditors, the Senior Secured Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Hedge Counterparties (to
the extent not a Super Senior Creditor), the Creditor Representatives, the arrangers of any Credit
Facility, the Security Agent, the delegates of the Security Agent and any receiver (together, the
‘‘Secured Parties’’));

(b) the Collateral will be enforced and other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i) to the extent the Instructing Group is being led by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all
proceeds or enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’) below: or

(ii) to the extent the Instructing Group is being led by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, either
(a) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’) or;
(b) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to
ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement
(see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and
discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(c) the enforcement actions are prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the
other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the

118


-----

enforcement of the Collateral or distressed disposal pursuant to enforcement will be determined by
the Instructing Group (see ‘‘—Manner of Enforcement’’ below) provided that it is consistent with the
Security Enforcement Objective;

(d) to the extent that the Collateral that is the subject of the proposed enforcement action is:

(i) over assets other than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of
such assets exceeds e5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies)
(‘‘Material Collateral’’); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors and at the expense of such creditors (unless it is incompatible with, or
unnecessary in respect of enforcement proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint a ‘‘big four’’
accounting firm, any reputable and independent international investment bank or other reputable
and independent professional services firm with experience in restructuring and enforcement (a
‘‘Financial Advisor’’) to opine as expert that the proceeds received from any such enforcement is fair
from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances (the ‘‘Financial
Advisor’s Opinion’’);

(e) The Security Agent shall not be required to appoint a Financial Advisor nor obtain a Financial
Advisor’s Opinion if a proposed enforcement of Collateral:

(i) would result in the receipt of sufficient enforcement proceeds in cash by the Security Agent as
to ensure that, after application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Secured
Liabilities would be repaid in full;

(ii) is in accordance with any applicable law; and

(iii) complies with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in relation to distressed disposals
(see ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreements—Release of the Guarantees and the Security—Distressed
_Disposal’’ below);_

(f) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice
of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by any provision of the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(g) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation
to any other enforcement of the Collateral that such action is fair from a financial point of view after
taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met;

(h) in the event that an enforcement of the Collateral or over some or all of the shares in a member of the
Group is over Material Collateral and such enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any
equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction, but this shall not require
enforcement of Collateral to take place by way of public auction;

(i) in the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors entitled to issue enforcement
instructions that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group (see ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreements—
_Manner of Enforcement’’ below) that such creditor(s) object to any enforcement of the Collateral on_
the grounds that such enforcement action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement
Objective (an ‘‘Objection’’), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of the
Collateral is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective;

(j) if the Security Agent receives an Objection, a Financial Advisor’s Opinion to the effect that the
particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement
Objective will be conclusive that the requirement referred to in paragraph (i) above has been met;
and

(k) the Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders, the
Pari Passu Debt Required Holders and the Security Agent.

119


-----

**_Manner of Enforcement_**

The Instructing Group is entitled to give instructions to the Security Agent in respect of enforcement of
Collateral comprises the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (in
each case acting through its respective Creditor Representative). However, if prior to the Super Senior
Discharge Date, and no insolvency event has occurred, the Security Agent has received conflicting
enforcement instructions from the Creditor Representatives then, to the extent instructions from the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have been given, the Security Agent will comply with such
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that if the Super Senior Liabilities have
not been fully and finally discharged, or no enforcement has occurred, within six months of the date on
which the first such enforcement instructions were first issued, then the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors will prevail. If the aforementioned conflicting enforcement instructions result from the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors failing to give instructions or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
instructing that the Collateral not be enforced, then the Security Agent shall not enforce the Collateral.

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Senior Secured Notes
Creditor, Hedge Counterparty (which are not Super Senior Creditors) or Pari Passu Creditor receives or
recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Collateral, or any creditors of Subordinated Liabilities
receive or recover any payment or distribution not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or
applied other than in accordance with ‘‘Application of Proceeds’’ below that it shall (subject to certain
prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee):

- in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that amount
on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
(ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the
relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts received from the realization or enforcement of all or
any part of the Collateral will be applied in the following order of priority:

- first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order: (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums
owing to the Security Agent, any of its delegates, any receiver, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
and the Senior Notes Trustee, as the case may be; and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each
Creditor Representative (to the extent not included in (i) above and excluding any Hedge
Counterparty in its capacity as its own Creditor Representative) of the unpaid fees, costs, expenses
and liabilities (and all interest thereon as provided in the relevant finance documents) of each
Creditor Representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor
Representative under any Collateral document or the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent that
such Collateral has been given in favor of such obligations);

- second, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the

of the Collateral documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of
the Security Agent;

- fifth, to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of the Senior Secured Noteholders for
application towards the discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and to the Pari Passu Debt
Representative on behalf of the Pari Passu Creditors for application towards the discharge of the

Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities); and

- sixth, after the discharge of all Secured Liabilities, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant
Debtor or other person entitled to it.

**_Additional Indebtedness_**

Subject to certain restrictions in the Credit Facility Documents, if a Debtor gives written notice to the
Security Agent, the Creditor Representatives and the Hedge Counterparties that it intends to enter into
one or more loans and/or credit or guarantee facilities and/or issue any debt securities under which it will
incur additional or replacement indebtedness (‘‘Additional Indebtedness’’) which is, under the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Credit Facility
Documents, permitted to share in the Collateral, then the parties will (at the cost, and with the consent of
the Company) enter into the requisite documentation to give effect to the Additional Indebtedness and
ensue that any such obligations and liabilities related thereto will have the ranking (and the creditors
under such Additional Indebtedness will have the rights and obligations) permitted to be conferred upon
it in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the
Credit Facility Documents (including, without limitation, the entry into of a new intercreditor agreement
on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) provided that such documentation does
not adversely affect the interests of any of the Secured Parties.

**_Release of the Guarantees and the Security_**

_Non-distressed Disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal is not being effected by enforcement of Collateral after the Collateral
has become enforceable or, in the case of a disposal to a person outside of the Group, after an
Acceleration Event in respect of Secured Liabilities has occurred (a ‘‘Distressed Disposal’’) and is
otherwise permitted or prohibited by the Credit Facility Document, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Senior Notes Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that the Security Agent is authorized (i) to release the Collateral or any other claim in respect of the
Secured Liabilities over the relevant asset; (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor, to release the Collateral or any other claim in respect of the Secured Liabilities over the assets of
that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries and (iii) to execute and deliver or enter
into any release of the Collateral or any claim described in the preceding clauses and issue any
certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the

Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its liabilities as borrower under the
Subordinated Documents, its liabilities under the Credit Facility Documents, the Senior Secured Notes
Documents, the Senior Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Hedging Agreements,

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may be amended with only the consent of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders, the Senior Notes Required

**_Governing Law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

**Hedging**

**_Introduction_**

On the Initial Issue Date, TMF Goup Holding B.V. amended and restated existing hedging agreements
with HSBC Bank Plc, UniCredit Bank AG and ING Bank N.V.. The hedging agreements with ING
Bank N.V. and UniCredit Bank AG are based on the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement and the hedging
agreement with HSBC Bank Plc is based upon the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement. Each hedging
agreement constitutes a Hedging Agreement for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Hedging Agreements provide for a floating to fixed rate hedge in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes.

123


-----

All Transactions (as defined in each Hedging Agreement) governed by each Hedging Agreement
constitute Transactions (as defined in each Hedging Agreement) that have been entered into in respect
of hedging arrangements described in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Hedging Agreements are guaranteed by the Guarantors as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement
and, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law, secured by the same collateral as for the Notes as
set out under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security’’ save as for the Spanish law pledges
granted in favor of the Security Agent by (i) TMF Spain, S.A. and TMF Holding International B.V. over the
shares of TMF Management (Spain), SL, TMF Sociedad de Participaci´on, SL, TMF Sociedad de
Direcci´on, SL, TMF Participations Holdings (Spain), SL and TMF VAT & Fiscal Representation Services
Spain, SL; and (ii) TMF Group Invest Two B.V. over the shares of TMF Management Holding Spain, S.L.,
which only secure the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral will be
applied in or towards repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Hedging Agreements in priority
to repayment of the Notes.

The provision and terms of the Collateral are subject to certain limitations and to the requirements of
applicable law and regulations. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Fraudulent conveyance
_and the laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_Collateral.’’_

**_Hedging enforcement restrictions_**

The Hedging Agreements are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent each
Hedging Counterparty is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, a Hedge Counterparty
(see definition above) may terminate, reduce or close-out in whole or in part any hedging transaction
under that Hedging Agreement prior to its stated maturity:

(a) if a Distress Event (see Intercreditor Agreement section above) has occurred;

(b) if:

(A) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is based on the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement:

(I) an Illegality or Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger (each as defined in the 1992 ISDA
Master Agreement); or

(II) an event similar in meaning and effect to a ‘‘Force Majeure Event’’ (as defined in
sub-paragraph (B) below),

has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement;

(B) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is based on the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, an
Illegality or Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger or a Force Majeure Event (each as defined in the
2002 ISDA Master Agreement) has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement; or

(C) in relation to a Hedging Agreement which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement, any
event similar in meaning and effect to an event described in paragraphs (A) or (B) above has
occurred under and in respect of that Hedging Agreement;

(c) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under either clause 27.6 (Insolvency) or
clause 27.7 (Insolvency proceedings) of the Revolving Credit Facility (or the equivalent provisions of
any other Credit Facility Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)), section 6.01(a)(ix)
(Events of Default) of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the equivalent provisions of any Pari
Passu Debt Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in relation to a Debtor (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is party to that Hedging Agreement;

(d) if the Majority Super Senior Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties), the Senior Secured
Notes Required Holders and the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (each as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (excluding any tranche of Pari Passu Debt which relates to any Hedging
Liabilities) give prior written consent to that termination or close-out being made;

124


-----

(e) if the Hedge Counterparty and the Issuer consensually agree to terminate, reduce or close-out in
whole or in part a transaction under a Hedging Agreement and no Default is continuing under any
Credit Facility Document, Senior Secured Notes Document, Senior Unsecured Notes Document or
Pari Passu Debt Document (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(f) if the Hedge Counterparty cease to be secured under the security provided by the Debtors without
their consent; or

(g) to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes to which the Hedging Agreement relates is refinanced or
repaid or prepaid in full.

**_Governing law_**

Each Hedging Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

**Existing Notes**

On December 7, 2012, the Issuer issued the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Senior
Notes. The terms and conditions of the Existing Senior Secured Notes are the same as those of the
Additional Senior Secured Notes, which are described under the heading ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes.’’ The terms and conditions of the Existing Senior Notes are the same as those of the_
Additional Senior Notes, which are described under the heading ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes.’’

**Subordinated Shareholder Loans**

The Issuer has received, and will receive prior to closing of the Offering of the Notes, loans from
TMF Group HoldCo B.V. under eight shareholder loan agreements. As of March 31, 2014, the aggregate
amount of shareholder loans outstanding from the Issuer to TMF Group HoldCo B.V. (including giving
pro forma effect to shareholder loans that were in place prior to closing of the Offering of the Notes as a
result of the assignment of certain intra-group receivables from TMF Group HoldCo B.V. to the Issuer and
certain other actions) would be approximately e387 million pursuant to those loans (as amended and as
amended and restated from time to time). See ‘‘Relationships and Transactions with Related Parties—
_Subordinated Shareholder Funding.’’_

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

In this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ the word ‘‘Issuer’’ refers only to TMF Group
Holding B.V. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, except for the purposes of financial data determined on a
consolidated basis. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth throughout
the text or under ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’

In this Offering, the Issuer will issue, and the Guarantors will guarantee, e45.0 million aggregate principal
amount of its Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) under an
indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) dated December 7, 2012 among, inter alios, the Issuer, the Guarantors, U.S.
Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), and HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited,
as security trustee (the ‘‘Security Trustee’’) pursuant to which the Issuer issued on December 7,
2012 e405 million aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the
‘‘Original Notes’’ and together with the Additional Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). The terms of the Notes include
those set forth in the Indenture. The Notes will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933
(the ‘‘Securities Act’’) and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. The Security Documents referred
to below under the caption ‘‘—Security’’ define the terms of the security for the benefit of the Notes and
the Guarantees. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this ‘‘Description of the Senior
**Secured Notes’’ include the Original Notes and the Additional Notes. The Original Notes and the**
Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. It does not, however, restate the Indenture, the
Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety and, where reference is made to a
particular provision of the Indenture, a Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement, such
reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the
provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. You
should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they
contain additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as a holder of
the Notes. After the Notes have been issued, copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement may be obtained by requesting it from the Issuer at the
address indicated under the caption ‘‘Listing and General Information.’’

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, we will not control the Target, and the Target will not be
subject to the covenants described in this Description of the Senior Secured Notes. As such, we cannot
assure you that prior to the Acquisition Closing Date the Target will not engage in activities that would
otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities
after the date of issuance of the Additional Notes and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into in the future. The terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees. See
the section entitled ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a summary of the
material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will not be qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the ‘‘TIA’’). Consequently, the Holders generally will not be entitled to the protections
provided under such TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those
requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the Holders of
certain relationships between it and the Issuer or the Guarantor.

The Issuer has made an application to list the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to admit the Additional Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer can
provide no assurance that this application will be accepted.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) are the general obligations of the Issuer;

(b) are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of
security over the Collateral only after any obligations secured on a super priority basis, including
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain priority Hedging
Obligations, have been paid in full;

(c) mature on December 1, 2018;

(d) rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Debt Incurred under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Senior Notes;

(e) are senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s existing and future Debt that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;

(f) are effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes, or secured by property or assets that do not secure the
Notes, to the extent of the value of property and assets securing such obligations;

(g) are a structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
do not provide Guarantees; and

(h) are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors. Each Guarantee:

(a) is a general obligation of the Guarantor that granted such Guarantee;

(b) is secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of
security over the Collateral only after any obligations secured on a super priority basis, including
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain priority hedging
obligations, have been paid in full;

(c) ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor
that are not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including its obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility;

(d) is effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are
secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing such Guarantee, or secured by property or assets that
do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of property and assets securing such Debt;

(e) is senior in right of payment to any and all of the applicable Guarantor’s existing and future Debt that
is subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee, including the guarantee of the Senior Notes by
the applicable Guarantor; and

(f) is subject to the restrictions on enforcement as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and as
described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**_General_**

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer depends
on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The
Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any
right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will
be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the
Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of
the Issuer or such Guarantor would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security in the assets of

127


-----

the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of
March 31, 2014, the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors had e9.6 million of indebtedness
and e65.9 million of trade payables and other liabilities outstanding, excluding the provisions, retirement
benefit obligations and FIT liabilities.

All of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries were ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ However, under the circumstances
described below under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to many of the restrictive_
covenants in the Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee the Notes.

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (the ‘‘Non-Guarantor Restricted
**Subsidiaries’’) may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial.**

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes. The Issuer will issue the Additional
Notes in the aggregate principal amount of e45.0 million in this Offering. The Notes will bear interest at a
rate per annum (the ‘‘Applicable Rate’’), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 5.375%, as determined
by an agent appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture (the
‘‘Calculation Agent’’), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch.

Interest on the Notes accrues at the rate of EURIBOR plus 5.375% per annum. Interest on the Notes is
payable quarterly in arrears from the Issue Date or from the most recent interest payment date to which
interest has been paid or provided for, whichever is the later. Interest on the Notes will be payable
quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Notes:

‘‘Determination Date,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

‘‘EURIBOR,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum)
for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major
banks in the Euro-zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide such bank’s
offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels
time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the
rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such
quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in London, as
selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum),
as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative
Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate
for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so
provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period.

‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region composed of member states of the European Union that at the relevant
time have adopted the euro.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with
the exception that the first Interest Period commenced on and include the Issue Date and ended on and
included March 1, 2013.

128


-----

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (a) e1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative
for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

‘‘Reuters Page 248’’ means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the
Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest Amount will be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the
commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in
the Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being
rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.487655)). All euro
amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with
one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Rate Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error,
be binding on all parties.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Note, provide the interest rate
then in effect with respect to the Notes.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Notes
will be subject to applicable procedures of the book-entry depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable.

Interest on overdue principal and interest and Additional Amounts and premium, if any, will accrue at a
rate that is 1% higher than the then applicable interest rate on the Notes.

The Applicable Rate on the Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

Subject to the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt,’’ the Issuer is
permitted to issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Subsequent Additional Notes’’) under the Indenture from
time to time. Any issuance of Subsequent Additional Notes is subject to the covenants in the Indenture.
The Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes that are issued will be treated as a single class for all
purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, those with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ include references to any Subsequent Additional Notes that
are issued.

**Form of Notes**

The Additional Notes will be issued on August 5, 2014 only in fully registered form without coupons and
only in denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof.

The Additional Notes will be initially in the form of one or more global notes (collectively, the ‘‘Global
**Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream**
or a nominee of such common depositary. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to in this
description as ‘‘book-entry interests,’’ will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants. The terms of the Indenture provides for the issuance of
definitive registered Notes in certain circumstances. See the section entitled ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form.’’_

**Transfer**

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

129


-----

All transfers of book-entry interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by
Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking and their respective participants. See the
section entitled ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as definitive registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of e100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the
form of definitive registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any taxes
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any definitive
registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date;

(d) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Excess Proceeds Offer.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and
interest on the Notes, at its office or through an agent in London, England that it will maintain for these
purposes. Initially, that agent will be the office of the Principal Paying Agent. Elavon Financial Services
Limited, UK Branch will act as the principal paying agent. The Issuer may change the paying agent
without prior notice to the Holders. In addition, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying
agent in connection with the Notes other than for the purposes of effecting a redemption described
under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or an offer to purchase the Notes described under either of ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’ The Issuer will_
make all payments in same day funds. Payments on the Global Notes will be made to the common
depositary as the registered Holder of the Global Notes.

The Issuer undertakes that it will maintain a paying agent in a member state of the European Union that
will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC (as
amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council
meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or
complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive.

The Issuer maintains a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) with offices in Ireland. The Issuer also maintains a
transfer agent in London. The Registrar is Elavon Financial Services Limited. The transfer agent is Elavon
Financial Services Limited, UK Branch in London.

The Issuer may change the paying agents, the Registrar or the transfer agents without prior notice to the
Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of paying
agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange posted on the official website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu.

No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but
the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental
charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

Under the Indenture, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to guarantee the due and punctual
payment of all amounts payable under the Notes, including principal, premium and Additional Amounts,
if any, and interest payable under the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are
contractually limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such
Guarantor by applicable law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being voidable or
unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer, or under similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee is
entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor.

Certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries organized in the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the
United States guaranteed the Notes on the Issue Date, and on June 4, 2013, TMF (B.V.I.) Ltd. guaranteed
the Notes as a post-closing guarantor (collectively, the ‘‘Guarantors’’).

We pledged the shares of Equity Trust Holdings S.`a r.l and TMF Luxembourg Holding S.A. in the share
capital of TMF Luxembourg S.A. (the ‘‘Luxembourg Regulated Entity’’) to secure the Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging. The Guarantors, excluding the Luxembourg Regulated
Entity, represented 60.8% of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2014 and held 52.6% of the Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31, 2014. The
Luxembourg Regulated Entity, together with the Guarantors, represented 82.1% of the Issuer’s
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and held 58.7% of the
Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31, 2014.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be
discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(a) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the
‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

(b) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if
the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the covenant
described under ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(c) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’);_

(d) upon a Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that
complies with the provisions under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(e) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance
with the terms of the Indenture;

(f) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to Guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ upon
the release or discharge of the guarantee of Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary that resulted in the
obligation to Guarantee the Notes; provided that no Event of Default would arise as a result and
such Restricted Subsidiary does not guarantee any other Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor;

131


-----

(g) as a result of any transaction permitted under paragraph (2) or clause (ii) of the final paragraph
under the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets’’;_

(h) in the event that the continuing obligation of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or the continued
existence of such Guarantee would, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, result in a violation
of an applicable regulation or order of a regulator that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented
through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or such Guarantor, and provided that such
Guarantor does not guarantee any other Debt of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

or (i) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee, subject to
receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will execute any documents reasonably required in
order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the consent nor the acknowledgement of the Trustee shall be
necessary to affect any such release. Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to
make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**_Limitations under the Guarantees_**

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under its
Guarantee, as applicable, being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent
transfer or under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or the maximum amount
otherwise permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee will be limited as required to comply with
corporate benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of the relevant
Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligations under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security.’’_

**Security**

**_General_**

The assets and property of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that are from time to time subject to, or
required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the ‘‘Collateral.’’
The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture are secured by the following:

(a) a pledge of the Issuer’s shares in the share capital of TMF Group B.V. (the ‘‘Company’’);

(b) pledges of the Restricted Subsidiaries’ shares in the share capital of each of the Guarantors (other
than (i) certain of the Guarantors organized in Luxembourg that are owned by the Luxembourg
Regulated Entity and (ii) TMF Spain S.A.);

(c) a pledge of each of Equity Trust Holdings S.`a r.l.’s and TMF Luxembourg Holding S.A.’s shares in
the share capital of the Luxembourg Regulated Entity;

(d) pledges of certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries’ shares in the share capital of certain
Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries organized in Spain; and

(e) pledges of certain intercompany receivables, trade receivables and bank accounts of certain of the
Guarantors organized in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

(f) a fixed and floating charge granted by TMF (B.V.I.) Ltd.

Any additional security interests that are in the future pledged to secure obligations under the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Indenture will also constitute Collateral.

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Security Trustee entered into certain security agreements defining
the terms of the Collateral that secures the Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Security Documents’’).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the_
pledgors of the Collateral are permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of

132


-----

Debt of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Subsequent Additional Notes, permitted
under the Indenture.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Security Documents, the
Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain
exclusive control of the Collateral, and to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any
and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock
resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions
(whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in
connection with the Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral,
in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of Default,
would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes or the Guarantees. Furthermore, the Collateral
securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of
Subsequent Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the
terms of the Indenture. See the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Additional Notes—
_The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.’’ By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily_
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a
timely manner or at all.

The Security Documents, respectively, are governed by applicable local laws and provide that the rights
with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Trustee and in respect of
the entire outstanding amount of the Notes.

The Indenture also provides that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an acceleration of
the amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default. The Security Trustee entered into the
Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. Each Holder, by
accepting a Note, appoints the Security Trustee as its agent under the Security Documents and
authorizes it to act as such. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any
direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act
through the Security Trustee. The Security Trustee will agree to any release of the security interest
created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture without requiring any
consent of the Holders.

**_Priority and Sharing_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Trustee will act on behalf of, and the Collateral (or,
in the case of the Collateral constituting pledges over the shares of certain of the Issuer’s Spanish
Subsidiaries, any proceeds following the enforcement thereof) will be shared equally and ratably among
(but without prejudice to the agreed order of application of proceeds following the enforcement thereof),
the holders of all Debt entitled to first-ranking security under the Indenture. This Debt includes the Notes,
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain obligations under Hedging Agreements and any
other Senior Secured Debt incurred in compliance with the Indenture. In addition, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist
other Permitted Collateral Liens as provided for under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens.’’ Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Debt secured by the Collateral_
could be significant.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain obligations under Hedging Agreements that are permitted to be
Incurred by clause (i) of the definition of Permitted Debt and permitted to be secured on the Collateral
(see ‘‘—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens’’) will receive priority with respect to any
proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral. Any proceeds received upon any
enforcement over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have been
repaid and such obligations under Hedging Agreements have been discharged from such recoveries,
will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other
Debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

133


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if additional Debt is to be incurred which is permitted to
share in the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, all
required documentation (including, if required, an Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will be entered
into in order to ensure that any such Debt will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it in
accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture; _provided that such_
documentation does not adversely affect the interests of the parties benefitting from the Collateral (other
than the effect of such additional Debt sharing in the Collateral). Such amendments may be made
without the consent of the Holders provided that such conditions are satisfied.

**_Releases_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release the Liens over property and other assets
constituting Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(a) with respect to a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor’s Guarantee as described in
‘‘—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees’’;

(b) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’; provided that in such a transaction where the Issuer ceases to_
exist, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company will be released and will reattach pursuant to a
new share pledge (on terms substantially identical to the existing Lien on the Capital Stock of the
Company), which will be granted by the successor entity;

(c) upon the Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance, satisfaction or discharge of the Notes as
provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ in each case, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Indenture;

(d) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise
violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

(e) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’);_

(f) in the event that the continued existence of such Lien would, in the good faith determination of the
Issuer, result in a violation of an applicable regulation or order of a regulator that cannot be avoided
or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or such pledgor, and
provided that such assets do not secure any other Debt of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(g) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of Liens on property and assets and
capital stock of such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(h) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

The Security Trustee and the Trustee (as applicable) will take all necessary action required to effectuate
any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture and the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Trustee
without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

In addition, subject to compliance with the covenants described under the headings ‘‘—Impairment of
_Security Interests’’ and ‘‘—Limitation on Liens,’’ if an Incurrence of Debt permitted by the covenant_
described under the heading ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ is implemented in a manner that requires the
release of the first priority security interest over all or some of the Collateral, the security interest over
such Collateral will be automatically released and replaced by new security in favor of the Notes and
Guarantees, on substantially the same terms as prior to release.

134


-----

**Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture provides that the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Trustee was authorized (without any
further consent of the Holders) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture provides that it is
subject to the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liability in respect of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain obligations under Hedging Agreements will have priority to any
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral. For a description of the
Intercreditor Agreement, see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ Any
proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility have been repaid and such obligations under Hedging Agreements have been
discharged from such recoveries, will be applied _pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the_
Indenture and the Notes and any other Debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be Incurred
and secured by the Collateral on a first priority basis pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

In addition, the Indenture provides that at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, any
Incurrence of Debt that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Security Trustee may (without the consent of the Holders) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement to reflect such additional Debt or enter into a new intercreditor agreement with the holders of
such Debt (or their duly authorized representatives) (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement, including with respect to enforcement
instructions, distributions and releases of Guarantees and Collateral; provided that any amendment to
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue
Date.

The Indenture also provides that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments
to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt
covered by the Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be
Incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement, respectively; provided that such Debt is Incurred in compliance
with the Indenture, (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Subsequent Additional
Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Subsequent
Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens or (6) make any other change that does
not adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the
Trustee or Security Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘—Amendments and
_Waivers’’ or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor_
Agreement, as applicable, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Trustee, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(a) appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) authorized the Trustee to become a party to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

135


-----

(d) irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Trustee shall be required to seek the consent of any Holders to
perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of
and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of
any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or resident for
tax purposes, or from or through which payment on the Notes or Guarantees is made (including the
jurisdiction of any paying agent) or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’) and any interest, penalties and other
liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’), unless such Taxes are required to be withheld or
deducted from such payments by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or
administration thereof. In the event that any amount for or on account of any such Taxes is required to be
withheld or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or Guarantees, the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (‘‘Additional
**Amounts’’) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of**
the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts) will be not less than the amount that such Holder or beneficial owner would have
received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a
Holder or beneficial owner of any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the Holder’s or
beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
but not limited to, citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a
permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management
present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than the mere receipt or
holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Note, Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the eligible Holder or beneficial
owner of any Note, prior to the relevant date on which a payment under and with respect to the
Notes is due and payable (the ‘‘Relevant Payment Date’’), to comply with the Issuer’s reasonable
written request addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner at least 30 calendar days prior to the
Relevant Payment Date, to provide accurate applicable information with respect to any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity
or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that
the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) which the Holder or
such beneficial owner is legally required and entitled to provide, whether imposed by statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction;

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to any Note;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation for payment (where
presentation is required in order to receive payment) by the Holder or beneficial owner of a Note on
a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or the
date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that
the Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting
the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period;

(f) any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is
imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to the European

136


-----

Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN
Council meetings of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive; or

(g) any Taxes that are imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner of
Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant
Note for a payment to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect
of any combination of the above items.

The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of
Taxes required by law and will remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant
taxing authority in accordance with all applicable laws. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain tax receipts from each such tax authority evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the date on which the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due
pursuant to applicable law, copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or relevant
Guarantor or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s or relevant Guarantor’s efforts to obtain such receipts, the
same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment by the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor. Upon reasonable request, copies of tax receipts or other evidence of
payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders or beneficial owners
of the Notes.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is
due and payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to
such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to the
date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will notify
the Trustee promptly thereafter), the Issuer or relevant Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting
forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts
to the Holders and beneficial owners on the payment date. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will provide
the Trustee with documentation satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional
Amounts. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will promptly publish a notice in
accordance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

The Indenture further provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor conducts business in any jurisdiction
(an ‘‘Additional Taxing Jurisdiction’’) other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is
required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to withhold or deduct any amount on account
of the Taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payment under the Notes or any
Guarantee, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so withheld or deducted but
for such conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Additional Amounts provision
described above will be considered to apply as if references in such provision to ‘‘Taxes’’ included taxes
imposed by way of withholding or deduction by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political
subdivision thereof or therein).

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay (i) any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, transfer, documentation, court, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes,
charges and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto in respect
of the execution, issue, delivery, registration of, or receipt of payments with respect to, the Notes, the
Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than, in
each case, on or in connection with a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale of the Notes); and
(ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the
enforcement of the Notes, Guarantee, Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the
occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person to the Issuer or
any Guarantor.

137


-----

Whenever in the Indenture, this Offering Memorandum or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’
there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal (and premiums, if any), Redemption Price,
interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note (including payments thereof
made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include mention of the payment of
Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are or would be payable in
respect thereof.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption on or after January 1, 2014_**

At any time on or after January 1, 2014 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts of
e 100,000 or integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed
as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on
January 1 of the years set forth below.

**_Redemption upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if
any, to the redemption date and all Additional Amounts (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional
_Amounts’’), if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the_
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next date on which any amount
would be payable in respect of the Notes or Guarantees, would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts
(but, in the case of any Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor
who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) which are more than a de
_minimis amount in respect of the Notes or Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof,_
which the Issuer or relevant Guarantor cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it
(including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction) as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’) affecting
taxation which is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture or,
if such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction has become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the
Indenture, on or after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor person, on or after the date of
assumption by the successor person of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s obligations hereunder); or

(b) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, regulations or
rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction) which is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the date of
the Indenture or, if such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction has become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
after the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor person,
on or after the date of assumption by the successor person of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s obligations
hereunder) (each of the foregoing clause (a) and this clause (b), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

No right to redeem the Notes will result from a Change in Tax Law affecting payments by a successor
person, unless the Change in Tax Law is publicly announced after the date that such entity first makes a
payment on the Notes. In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Issuer or a
Guarantor conducting business in an Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above), the Change in
Tax Law must be publicly announced after the date the Issuer or relevant Guarantor begins to conduct
the business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.

-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Issuer or relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes or Guarantee were then due and (b) unless at
the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have
occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a
result of the Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
independent tax counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions
precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other
directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of 26 and 27 November 2000
on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to
conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption_**

The Issuer will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes described above in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices.’’ The Issuer will inform the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange of the principal amount of the Notes that have not been redeemed in connection with
any optional redemption. If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar will
select the Notes by a method that complies with the requirements, as certified to the Trustee and the
Registrar by the Issuer, of applicable law and the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed at such time or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, pro rata or by such
other method as the Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that no
such partial redemption will reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less
than e100,000.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. Neither
the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selection made by the Registrar in accordance with
this paragraph.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the
Notes as described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’ The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and_
from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture contains, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume,
guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become

responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to ‘‘Incur’’
or, as appropriate, an ‘‘Incurrence’’), any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); provided that the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if:

(a) at the time of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the
application of the proceeds thereof, on a _pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio for the four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available
immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would be greater
than 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) if the debt to be Incurred is Senior Secured Debt, at the time of such Incurrence and after giving
effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma

financial statements are available immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken as
one period, is less than 3.25 to 1.0.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the last proviso of paragraph (2) of this covenant,
Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries may not Incur Debt pursuant to this paragraph (1) if, after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), the aggregate amount of Debt of Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred
pursuant to this paragraph (1) would exceed e30.0 million.

(2) This ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted
**Debt’’):**

(a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of Debt under Credit Facilities in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to e70.0 million,

not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Debt is (x) unsecured and (y) (except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection
with the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) it is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash (whether
upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the performance in full of its
obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any
transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing to the Issuer
or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case,
be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (e);

(f) the guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Debt was permitted to be incurred by another
provision of this covenant; provided that if the Debt being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari
_passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then such guarantee must be subordinated or pari_
_passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Debt guaranteed;_

assets;

(r) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt to the extent the net proceeds

Subsidiary of Debt (other than and in addition to Debt permitted under clauses (a) through
(r) above) in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding, including all Debt
incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Debt Incurred pursuant
to this clause (s), not to exceed the greater of e45.0 million and 4.5% of Consolidated Total

_Provided,_ _however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate_

Subsidiary pursuant to each of the last sentence of paragraph (1) of this covenant and clauses (l)
and (s) of this paragraph (2), including all Debt Incurred by a Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary
to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any such Debt, shall not exceed
e30.0 million.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Debt (or any part thereof) to be
Incurred pursuant to this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant is intended to rank senior to the Notes or the
Guarantees with respect to proceeds distributions of any enforcement of any of the Collateral, such
Debt (or any part thereof) may only consist of: (i) up to e70.0 million in aggregate principal amount
at any one time outstanding and Incurred pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Debt

142


-----

under a revolving credit facility and (ii) and any currency and interest obligations Incurred pursuant
to clause (i) of the definition of Permitted Debt under Hedging Agreements in respect of (X) the
Notes, any Subsequent Additional Notes and any Permitted Refinancing Debt in respect thereof and
(Y) up to e70.0 million in aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of Debt to be
Incurred under a revolving credit facility pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Debt, in
each case secured on the Collateral.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, in the event that
an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (a) through (s) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the
paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item
of Debt on the date of its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant. Debt under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding on the Issue Date will initially be
deemed to have been Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of
paragraph (2) above. In addition, any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred pursuant to one of
the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (a) through (s) of paragraph (2) above, or is
entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, may later
be reclassified by the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to any
other applicable clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant to
the extent that such reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such other clause of
paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at the time of such
reclassification.

(5) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in euros
where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Euro
Equivalent determined on the date such Debt was Incurred (in the case of term Debt) or committed
(in the case of revolving Debt), or the Issue Date, in the case of Debt outstanding as of the Issue
Date; provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Hedging
Agreement (with respect to euros) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of
such Debt expressed in euros will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.
The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in the same currency as the Debt
being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Debt being refinanced determined on the date
such Debt being refinanced was initially Incurred. If any Debt is incurred to refinance any Debt
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction will be deemed to not have been
exceeded so long as the amount of such Permitted Refinancing Debt does not exceed the amount
set forth in clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Refinancing Debt. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this
‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of
currencies will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(6) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the ‘‘Limitation on
_Liens’’ covenant; and_

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount
or of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest or
dividends in the form of additional Debt,

will not, in any case, be treated as Debt, and, with respect to obligations in respect of letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility that are
being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Debt and such letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments relate to other Debt of the Issuers or any
Restricted Subsidiary, such other Debt shall not be included for purposes of determining any
particular Incurrence of Debt under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

clauses (x) and (y) of this clause (iii), the aggregate proceeds and the Fair Market Value of
marketable securities and other assets received by the Issuer at the time of such
conversion or exchange (excluding Excluded Contributions); plus

(iv) in the case of the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the disposition or

such period.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may take
the following actions:

stand-alone basis and the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are relieved
thereby;

(j) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, following an Initial
Public Offering after the Issue Date, the payment of dividends on the Issuer’s common stock (or
the payment of dividends to a Holding Company to fund the payment by such Holding
Company of dividends of such Holding Company’s common stock) or payments made with
respect to Subordinated Shareholder Funding not to exceed in any fiscal year the greater of
(i) 6% of the aggregate proceeds of such Initial Public Offering and any subsequent Equity
Offering received by, and in the case of an Initial Public Offering or subsequent Equity Offering
of such Holding Company, contributed to the common equity capital of, the Issuer, except to
the extent that such proceeds are designated as constituting an Excluded Contribution, and
(ii) 5% of the Market Capitalization provided that in the case of clause (ii) the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 4.0 to 1.0;

(k) the repurchase, redemption, acquisition or retirement or making of any other payments with
respect to Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (i) with any Excess
Proceeds remaining after the consummation of an Excess Proceeds Offer pursuant to the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales,’’ at a purchase price not
greater than 100% of the principal amount of such Subordinated Debt plus accrued and unpaid
interest (ii) following a Change of Control pursuant to provisions similar to those described

146


-----

under ‘‘—Change of Control’’ but only (X) if required, if the Issuer shall have complied with the
terms of the covenant described above under the heading ‘‘—Change of Control’’ and
purchased all Notes tendered pursuant to the offer to repurchase all of the Notes required
thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or
retiring such Subordinated Debt and (Y) at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the
principal amount of such Subordinated Debt plus accrued and unpaid interest or (iii) that is
Acquired Debt (other than Acquired Debt Incurred in connection with the acquisition of a
Person resulting in such Person becoming or being acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary);

(l) Restricted Payments that are made with Excluded Contributions;

(m) the distribution, as a dividend or otherwise, of shares of Capital Stock of, or Debt owed to the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries by, Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(n) any Restricted Payment permitted under clause (i), (iv), (v) and (x) of paragraph (2) of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’;

(o) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Restricted
Payment; provided that the total aggregate amount of Restricted Payments outstanding under
this clause (o) does not exceed e35.0 million; or

(p) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Restricted
Payment so long as after giving effect to such Restricted Payment on a pro forma basis, the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Issuer is less than 3.5 to 1.0.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

The indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Debt as subordinated or junior to secured Debt merely
because it is unsecured or (2) senior Debt as subordinated or junior to any other senior Debt merely
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Debt (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Debt is
also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee on
substantially identical terms; _provided,_ _however, that no Debt will be deemed to be contractually_
subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase,
exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with any Affiliate of the
Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater than e2.5 million unless such
transaction or series of transactions is entered into in good faith and:

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially
less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s length transaction with third parties that are
not Affiliates;

(b) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments
or the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than
e10.0 million, such transaction or transactions have been approved by a majority of the
Disinterested Members, if any, of the Board of Directors resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (a) above; and

(c) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments
or the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than
e30.0 million, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written opinion of an Independent Financial

147


-----

Advisor stating that the transaction or series of transactions is (x) fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view, taking account of all relevant circumstances
or (y) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at
such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(i) any directors’ fees and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors’ and officers’
insurance premiums), consulting fees, employee compensation, collective bargaining or
similar arrangements, employee and director bonuses, employment or consulting agreements
and arrangements or employee benefit arrangements, including stock options, stock
appreciation rights or similar equity or equity-like incentives or legal fees entered into in the
ordinary course of business, and indemnification provided to, and the payment of reasonable
and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses of, officers, directors, employees or
consultants of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(ii) any Permitted Investment (other than pursuant to clauses (c), (i) (to the extent such guarantee,
keepwell or similar arrangement is in respect of Debt of a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary), (p) or (q) of the definition thereof) or any Restricted Payment not
prohibited by the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant;

(iii) loans and advances to officers, directors and employees (or any amendment or transaction
with respect thereto), in each case (X) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practices, (Y) to fund such Person’s purchase of Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect Holding Company thereof, if the proceeds of any such loans to purchase Capital Stock
under this clause (iii) are either received by the Issuer or contributed by such Holding Company
of the Issuer and are excluded from the calculation under clause (ii) of paragraph (2) of
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ above except to the extent such
loans are actually repaid or (Z) otherwise in an aggregate amount not to exceed e5.0 million
outstanding at any one time under this clause (iii);

(iv) agreements and arrangements existing on the Issue Date (including the agreements and
arrangements described under the caption ‘‘Relationships and Transactions with Related
_Parties’’) and any amendment, modification, extension or supplement thereto; provided that_
any such amendment, modification, extension or supplement to the terms thereof, taken or a
whole, is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders and to the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable than the original agreement or arrangement as in effect
on the Issue Date;

(v) the issuance of securities pursuant to, or for the purpose of the funding of, employment
arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans, as long as the terms thereof are or
have been previously approved by the Issuer’s Board of Directors;

(vi) the granting and performance of registration or similar rights for the Issuer’s securities;

(vii) transactions between or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is an
affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns, directly or indirectly through a Restricted
Subsidiary, Capital Stock of, or controls, such person;

(viii) (a) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Issuer or any
Incurrence of or amendment to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding, and (b) the existence
of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under
the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any purchase agreement relating thereto);

(ix) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor or joint venture partners, in each case in the ordinary
course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to
the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of members of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as
favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(x) Permitted Payments to Holding Companies and payments by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Permitted Holders for any customary financial advisory, financing,

148


-----

underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investing banking activities, including
without limitation in connection with acquisitions or divestitures or any indemnification
payments made as a result thereof, which payments are approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors in good faith;

(xi) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Debt or Redeemable Capital Stock of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Debt or Redeemable Capital Stock is
purchased by Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the
Issuer’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the
Issuer’s Affiliates;

(xii) payments pursuant to the tax sharing arrangements permitted under paragraph 3(i) under the
heading ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ (without duplication of any such payments);

(xiii) transactions in the ordinary course of business with Shelf Companies; and

(xiv)transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the
requirements of clause (a) of paragraph (1) above.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind
securing Debt upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the
case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (x) Permitted Liens or (y) Liens on
property or assets that are not Permitted Liens (the ‘‘Initial Lien’’) if payments due under the Notes and
the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with (or in the case of Subordinated Debt, prior or
senior thereto with the same relative priority as the Notes or such Guarantee, as applicable, shall have
with respect to such Subordinated Debt) the obligations secured by the Initial Lien for so long as such
obligations are so secured, and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to this covenant will provide by its terms that
such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (a) upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien other than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to the
assets subject to such Lien or (b) as set forth under the heading ‘‘Security—Releases.’’

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, than the Issuer will make an offer (a ‘‘Change of Control
**Offer’’) to each Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in minimum**
denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price
(the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’) in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase
**Date’’).**

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will:

(a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be published, if at the time of such notice the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, in the Luxemburger Wort (or another leading newspaper of general
circulation in Luxembourg) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and
regulations, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, www.bourse.lu;
and

(b) send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each
Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, which notice
will state:

(i) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

(ii) the transaction or transactions giving rise to the Change of Control;

149


-----

(iii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which
will be a business day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date such
notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under
the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations;

(iv) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control
Purchase Price is not paid on such date;

(v) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(vi) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control
Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

(3) The Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by it) upon receipt of an authenticating order
from the Issuer, will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount
equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form
or to each Holder of certificated Notes; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal_
amount of e100,000 or in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof; provided that no Holder may
tender any Notes if as a result of such tender, such Holder would hold less than e100,000 of Notes.
The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a
third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the
times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at
least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such tender offer. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control
Offer if the Issuer has, prior to the time that is required to send a notice of the Change of Control
Offer to the Trustee pursuant to clause (2) above, delivered notice to the Trustee of its intention to
redeem Notes as described under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption.’’

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-l
under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a
Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the
Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control would also constitute a
change of control under the Senior Notes Indenture and could constitute a default under the Revolving
Credit Facility. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain
descriptions of certain events that, if they occurred, would require such debt to be repurchased. In
addition, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and any such future debt, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors of
such repurchase.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, and may be conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time of Change of
Control Offer is made.

The provisions of the Indenture does not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in
the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction
that may adversely affect Holders, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.
Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture,
including those described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence, however, of a Holder of the
Notes’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter
a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a
Change of Control.

150


-----

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have
available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be
delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were
available, the terms of the other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the
Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any
such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase
obligations to Holders who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not
made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure
would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders the rights described
under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’ An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, would result in a
cross default under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of Other
_Indebtedness,’’ including under the Revolving Credit Facility._

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Please see the section entitled ‘‘—Amendments
_and Waivers.’’_

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale
unless:

(a) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Sale is not
less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors); and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of
such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such
Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the footnotes thereto) (other than contingent
liabilities and Subordinated Debt), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such liabilities or (y) Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of
such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (c) or (e) of paragraph (2) of
this covenant;

(v) consideration consisting of Debt (other than Subordinated Debt) of the Issuer or any
Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but
only to the extent that such Debt has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor;

(vi) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one

151


-----

time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of e40.0 million and 4.0% of Consolidated Total
Assets (with the Fair Market Value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value); _provided that Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this_
covenant other than deferred consideration or securities representing deferred
consideration shall not exceed the greater of e10.0 million and 1.0% of Consolidated Total
Assets; or

(vii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of this
paragraph (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Sale, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Sale and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(a) repay or prepay any then outstanding Senior Debt (i) incurred under clause (a) of paragraph (2)
of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant; (ii) of a Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary, or (iii) that is
secured by a Lien on assets or property which were the subject of the Asset Sale and which did
not constitute Collateral;

(b) redeem Notes or purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price equal to
at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest (at the option of
the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary);

(c) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) to make a capital expenditure;

(e) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) not classified as
current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business;

(f) to repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay (i) Senior Debt that is secured by the Collateral (other
than as set forth in clause (a)(i) above) or (ii) Pari Passu Debt; provided that, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii) the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) shall make an offer to all
Holders on a pro rata basis to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
below for an Excess Proceeds Offer;

(g) any combination of the foregoing; or

(h) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (c), (d) or
(e) of this paragraph, _provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the
expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated
by that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes
‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds e15.0 million, the Issuer will, within 15
Business Days of the end of the applicable period in paragraph (2) above, make an offer to
purchase (an ‘‘Excess Proceeds Offer’’) from all Holders and from the holders of any Pari Passu
Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a _pro rata basis, in accordance with the_
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the
maximum principal amount (expressed as a minimum amount of e100,000 and integral multiples of
e1,000 in excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the
amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will
be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal
amount of such Note and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the

152


-----

principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt, plus, in each case,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu
Debt for purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders
thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt to be purchased will be selected by the Registrar or the Principal Paying Agent on a pro rata
basis (based upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such
Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and
Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of
e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not later than 60 days
from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as
may be required under the Exchange Act.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws
and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are
then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this ‘‘Limitation on
_Asset Sales’’ covenant by virtue thereof._

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) below, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission
might or would have the result of materially impairing any security interest with respect to any of the
assets comprising the Collateral for the benefit of the Holders (including the priority thereof), and the
Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that the Issuer and
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with the Indenture.

(2) The Indenture provides that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, mistakes, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;
(ii) provide for any Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) evidence and provide for
the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Trustee; or (v) make any other
change thereto that does not materially impair any security interest over any of the assets
comprising the Collateral or otherwise adversely affect the Holders in any material respect;
_provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (v) above, no Security Document may be_
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) or otherwise modified or
replaced, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release and retaking, modification or renewal, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either:

(a) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release and retaking, modification or replacement;

(b) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant obligor (acting in
good faith), in the form set forth as an exhibit to the Indenture, that confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transaction related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release and retaking, modification or
replacement; or

153


-----

(c) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary
qualifications and exceptions) confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release and retaking,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security
Documents as so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and
retaken, modified or replaced remain valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were
not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release an retaking, modification or replacement.

(3) Nothing in this ‘‘Impairment of Security Interest’’ covenant will restrict the release or replacement of
any security interests in compliance with the provisions set out under the heading ‘‘—Security—
_Releases.’’_

(4) In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this ‘‘Impairment of Security Interest’’
covenant, the Trustee and/or the Security Trustee (as the case may be) will consent to any such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the
need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Holding Company Activities_**

The Issuer must not carry on any business or own any assets other than (a) the ownership of Capital
Stock of the Company (or a Successor Guarantor following a transaction that complies with the
provisions described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’; provided that
in such a transaction where the Company ceases to exist, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company
will be released and will be replaced with a new share pledge (on terms substantially identical to the

or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any manner become liable with respect to
any other Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously
executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Guarantee of the payment of the
Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu with such_
Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Debt.

any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

modifications, restatements, renewals, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings,

modifications, restatements, renewals, extension, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer’s Board of Directors,

assets of the Person, so acquired;

(d) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any Permitted Refinancing Debt; provided that the

described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially
more disadvantageous to the Holders than is customary in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) and either: (x) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes as and when they come due; or (y) such encumbrance or
restriction applies only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating
to such Debt.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly
established Subsidiaries) to be an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such
designation; and

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’
covenant in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the net assets of such Subsidiary.

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment
constituting a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Payment pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ covenant, as determined by the Issuer, in an amount equal to the Fair Market_
Value of the net assets of such Subsidiary.

(3) The Indenture further provides that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will at any time:

(a) provide a guarantee of, or similar credit support to, any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary
(including of any undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Debt); (other than a
pledge Capital Stock or Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary on a non-recourse basis as long as

property), except to the extent permitted under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and
‘‘Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’ covenants; or

(b) be directly or indirectly liable for any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, except to the extent
permitted under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and ‘‘Limitation on Transactions with

covenant.

(5) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board
of Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors
with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such
designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s
fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the
last fiscal quarter of the Issuer’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

(2) In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders, beneficial owners of the Notes and prospective
investors, upon the request of such Holders or prospective investors, any information required to be

transferable under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

(3) The Issuer shall also make available copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee; (a) on the Issuer’s

financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth in clause (1) above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

(5) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(6) All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant shall be made in the English
language.

(7) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(1) The Issuer will not, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’
properties and assets to any other Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the
time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer)
formed by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or
to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially

158

all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, the United States of America, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia; and

(y) will expressly assume, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements, and the Security
Documents, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee; and the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents will remain in full force and effect as
so amended or supplemented;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, no Default or Event
of Default will have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of
transactions on a _pro forma basis (on the assumption that the transaction or series of_
transactions occurred on the first day of the four quarter fiscal period immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate adjustments
with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such _pro forma_
calculation), the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor under
the Indenture) (i) could Incur at least e1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio set forth in paragraph (1)(a) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (attaching the computations to
demonstrate compliance with clauses (b) and (c) above) and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is
required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the
requirements of the Indenture and that the Notes, the supplemental indenture and the
Indenture constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer or the Surviving Entity,
enforceable in accordance with their terms; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction
of clauses (1)(b) and (1)(c) above;

(e) the Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and

premium, if any, and interest, on the Notes; and

(f) for as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notify such exchange of any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

(2) Subject to the provisions described under ‘‘—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,’’ no
Guarantor will, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or other combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s properties and assets to any other
Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving
effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either (x) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than
such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other

159


-----

disposition will have been made (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being
herein called the ‘‘Successor Guarantor’’) expressly assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, and Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, pursuant to supplemental indentures
and/or agreements in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or (y) such sale, disposition or
consolidation, amalgamation or combination is not in violation of the covenant ‘‘—Asset Sales’’;

(b) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing;

(c) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that
such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in
connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that the Guarantee and the supplemental indenture constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor, enforceable in
accordance with their terms; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on
an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clause (2)(b)
above; and

(d) the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, the relevant Guarantor under the Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets, the Guarantor will not be released from the obligation
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the Guarantee.

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets’’ covenant shall not restrict
(and shall not apply to): (i) any Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor
or any other Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving

Documents and clauses 1(a) and 1(d) shall apply to such transaction and (iv) the Issuer or any
Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction,
or changing the legal form of such entity; _provided clauses (1)(a), (1)(d) and (1)(e) above or_
clauses (2)(a) and (2)(d) above, as applicable, shall apply to such transactions described in this
clause (iv).

**_Business Activities_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other
than Permitted Businesses, except to the extent that would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder or beneficial owners of the Notes
for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of
the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the
Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents
relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an
inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to
exclude Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such
consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the
payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European
Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith)

160


-----

would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file
the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any
summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction; or such
solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Covenant Suspension_**

If on any date following the date of the Indenture:

(1) the Notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB� or better by S&P (or, if either such entity
ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the Issuer, the equivalent investment
grade credit rating from any other ‘‘nationally recognized statistical rating organization’’ within the
meaning of Rule 15c3- 1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Issuer as a
replacement agency); and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ will be suspended:

(a) ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’;

(b) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

(c) ‘‘—Limitation on Layered Debt’’;

(d) ‘‘—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’;

(e) ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales’’;

(f) ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’;

(g) ‘‘—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(h) ‘‘—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’;
and

(i) clause (c) of paragraph (1) of the covenant described above under the caption ‘‘—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets.’’_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by either such rating agency should subsequently
decline to below Baa3 or BBB�, respectively, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as at and from
the date of such rating decline. The period during which the covenants set forth above are suspended
pursuant to this provision is the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ The reinstatement of any covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly
taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that, with respect to any Restricted
Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as
though the ‘‘Restricted Payments’’ covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension
Period and (2) all Debt incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or
issued pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of Permitted Debt. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension
Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

In addition, the Indenture also permits, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which the Notes cease to be rated Baa3 or BBB� as long as the contractual commitments were
entered into during the Suspension Period and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer being rated
Baa3 or BBB�.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this
heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension
of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such
event.

There can be no assurance thereto that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade
rating.

161

**Events of Default**

(1) Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any

heading ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary
that is contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee (other than specified in clause (a), (b) or
(c) above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days or more after written notice (i) to
the Issuer by the Trustee or (ii) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt for money borrowed by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if that default:

(x) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt prior to its express maturity; or

(y) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the
expiration of any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required
prepayment) and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of
such Debt has not been extended,

and, in each case, the outstanding principal amount of any such Debt under which there has
been a failure to pay at final maturity thereof or the payment of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates e25.0 million or more;

(f) except as permitted in the Indenture, any Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any such Guarantor, or any Person
acting on behalf of any such Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in
accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture, any Guarantee or the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(g) with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of e10.0 million, one or more of
the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect, or a Security
Document shall be declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or the
relevant grantor of the security granted pursuant to a Security Document asserts, in any
pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such Security Document is invalid or
unenforceable for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes and discharge of the Indenture and the Notes, other than, in each
case, pursuant to limitations on enforceability, validity or effectiveness imposed by applicable
law, regulation or order of a regulator or the terms of such Security Document or except in
accordance with the terms of such Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements or the Indenture, including the release provisions thereof,
and any such Default continues for 10 days;

(h) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by
insurance) shall be rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary either individually
or in an aggregate amount, in each case in excess of e25.0 million, which judgments, orders or
decrees are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes
final; and

(i) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership described in the
Indenture with respect to the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(i) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding by written notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders)

162


-----

may, and the Trustee, upon the written request of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all of the outstanding Notes
immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect
of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(i) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding
Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on
the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

(4) Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee by the Indenture. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or
Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of
Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

(5) The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may,
on behalf of the Holders, (i) waive any past defaults under the Indenture, except a default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in
which case, the consent of the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required and
(ii) rescind any acceleration and its consequences if (x) such rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) all existing Events of Default, other than
the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
and (z) the Issuer has paid the Trustee its compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for any
properly incurred expense, disbursements and advances.

(6) No Holder has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any remedy
thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes have made a written request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory
to the Trustee against loss, liability or expense to institute such proceeding as Trustee under the
Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after
receipt of such notice and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions
inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for the
enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest
on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

(7) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee
will mail to each Holder of the Notes notice of the Default or Event of Default within 60 days after
being notified of the Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or an Event of Default in the
payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee
may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if a committee of its trust officers
in good faith determines that withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of the
Holders.

(8) The Issuer will be required to notify the Trustee within 15 Business Days of the occurrence of any
Default.

(9) The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’) then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Reports to Holders’’ or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Indenture.

(10) In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (e) of paragraph (l) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if, within 20 days after the Event of Default arose, the event
of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) shall be

163


-----

remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such Event of
Default shall have been discharged in full and if (X) the annulment of the acceleration (if applicable)
of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and
(Y) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including
Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Notes, have been cured or waived.

**Defeasance**

(1) The Indenture provides that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity
of the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect
to the outstanding Notes (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be
deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except
as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes,
replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in
respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

(2) In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant
**Defeasance’’) and thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default**
or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs,
certain events described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. These events will not include events relating to nonpayment, bankruptcy,
insolvency and receivership. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of
whether it has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

(3) In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee (or such
other entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of the Holders, cash in
euro, European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium,
if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on
the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the
Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (x) the Issuer has received from, or
there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (y) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that (and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that) the Holders and beneficial
owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the Holders and beneficial
owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

164


-----

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit);

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing
of funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders over the other creditors of the
Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or
other creditors, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing
debts of the Issuer to the detriment of the relevant creditors; and

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel,
each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

(4) If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of
any acceleration occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain
liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Trustee for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euro or
European Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes
that have not, prior to such time, been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the
date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been
deposited on trust or segregated and held on trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to
the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation: (x) have
become due and payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise);
(y) will become due and payable within one year of Stated Maturity; or (z) are to be called for
redemption within one year of the proposed discharge date under arrangements satisfactory to
the Principal Paying Agent for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuer’s
name and at the Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer under the
Indenture; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a)
and (b)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

(1) With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Security Trustee are

165


-----

permitted to amend or supplement the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents or waive any Default or non-compliance
with any provision of the Indenture; provided that no such modification, amendment or waiver may,

(a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of Additional Amounts or
interest on, any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate
of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of
Default related thereto);

(c) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional
Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;

with the provisions of such Note, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements;

(e) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver of provisions of the Indenture;

(f) except as otherwise permitted under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets,’’ consent to the assignment or transfer by the Issuer of any of the Issuer’s rights or_
obligations under the Indenture;

(g) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Guarantees,
except in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements; or

(h) release any Lien on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, except in
compliance with the terms of the Security Documents, Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Security Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents:

(i) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer and the assumption by any such
successor of the covenants in the Indenture and in the Notes in accordance with ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;_

(ii) to add to the Issuer’s covenants and those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of
the Notes for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuer or any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes, as applicable, in the
Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(iii) to cure any ambiguity or mistake or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture, the
Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security Document that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the
Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security Document or make any other provisions with respect to matters or
questions arising under the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; or make any change that
does not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of the Holders of the
Notes;

(iv) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security Document to any provision of this Description of the Senior Secured Notes;

(v) to release any Guarantor or Collateral in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents;

(vi) to add a Guarantor or other guarantor under the Indenture;

166


-----

(vii) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee and/or
Security Trustee under the Indenture;

(viii) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes as additional security for the
payment and performance of the Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture,
in any property, or assets, including any of which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Trustee pursuant to
the Indenture or otherwise, or to enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;

(ix) to provide for the issuance of Subsequent Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted
by the terms of and limitations set forth in the Indenture; and

(x) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes.

(3) The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall be entitled
to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including opinions of counsel and Officer’s
Certificates.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to the Indenture, Notes owned by
the Issuer or by an Affiliate of the Issuer will be disregarded and treated as if they were not outstanding.

**Currency Indemnity**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a
currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court
of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the
Trustee or a Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such Holder from the
Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase euro on that date, on
the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that could be recovered following such a
purchase is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer
and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the recipient against the cost of the recipient’s
making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes of this
paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual
purchase of euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or
recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would
have been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Notices**

Notices regarding the Notes will be published, if and for as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, in a newspaper having a
general circulation in Luxembourg (which is currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort), or to the
extent and in the manner permitted by the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange,
posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, www.bourse.lu.

167


-----

If and so long as the Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, notices will also be given in
accordance with any applicable requirements of such securities exchange.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Guarantees, the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The
waiver and release will be part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Trustee**

The Indenture contains limitations on the rights of the Trustee under the Indenture in the event the
Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of it will
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The Security
Documents are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of various jurisdictions.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Issuer and each Guarantor has each irrevocably appointed Lords Securities Corporation as its
agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and
the Guarantees, as the case may be, brought in any U.S. federal or state court located in The Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, State of New York and each of the parties to the Indenture has submitted to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state courts located in The Borough of Manhattan,
City of New York, State of New York. If for any reason Lords Securities Corporation is unable to serve in
such capacity, the Issuer and each Guarantor shall appoint another agent reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee.

scheduled principal payment of such Debt; multiplied by

(ii) the amount of each such principal payment;

by

(b) the sum of all such principal payments.

‘‘Beneficial Owner’’ has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the
Exchange Act, except that in calculating the beneficial ownership of any particular ‘‘person’’ (as that term
is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), such ‘‘person’’ will be deemed to have beneficial
ownership of all securities that such ‘‘person’’ has the right to acquire by conversion or exercise of other
securities, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only after the passage of time. The

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

In this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes,’’ the word ‘‘Issuer’’ refers only to TMF Group Holding B.V. and
not to any of its Subsidiaries, except for the purposes of financial data determined on a consolidated
basis. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth throughout the text or
under ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’

In this Offering, the Issuer will issue, and the Guarantors will guarantee, e20.0 million aggregate principal
amount of its 9.875% Fixed Rate Senior Notes due 2019 (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) under an indenture
(the ‘‘Indenture’’) among, _inter alios, the Issuer, the Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as_
trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’) pursuant to which the Issuer issued on December 7, 2012 e175 million
aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due 2019 (the ‘‘Original Notes’’ and together with the
Additional Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The
Notes will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ‘‘Securities Act’’) and will be
subject to certain transfer restrictions. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ include the Original Notes and the Additional Notes. The Original
Notes and the Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement. It does not, however, restate the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement in
their entirety and, where reference is made to a particular provision of the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement, such reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by
reference to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. You should
read the Indenture and the and the Intercreditor Agreement because they contain additional information
and because they and not this description define your rights as a holder of the Notes. After the Notes
have been issued, copies of the Indenture, the form of Note and the Intercreditor Agreement may be
obtained by requesting it from the Issuer at the address indicated under the caption ‘‘Listing and General
_Information.’’_

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, we will not control the Target, and the Target will not be
subject to the covenants described in this Description of the Notes. As such, we cannot assure you that
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date the Target will not engage in activities that would otherwise have
been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the date of
issuance of the Additional Notes and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into in the future. The terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees. See
the section entitled ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a summary of the
material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will not be qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the ‘‘TIA’’). Consequently, the Holders generally will not be entitled to the protections
provided under such TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those
requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the Holders of
certain relationships between it and the Issuer or the Guarantor.

The Issuer has made an application to list the Additional Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to admit the Additional Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer can
provide no assurance that this application will be accepted.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) are the general obligations of the Issuer;

(b) mature on December 1, 2019;

191


-----

(c) rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Debt Incurred under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Senior Secured Notes;

(d) are senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s existing and future Debt that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;

(e) are effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes, or secured by property or assets that do not secure the
Notes, to the extent of the value of property and assets securing such obligations;

(f) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
do not provide Guarantees; and

(g) are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors. Each Guarantee:

(a) is a general subordinated obligation of the Guarantor that granted such Guarantee;

(b) ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future subordinated Debt of the applicable
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

(c) is effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are
secured by Liens to the extent of the value of property and assets securing such obligations;

(d) is junior in right of payment to any and all of the applicable Guarantor’s existing and future Senior
Debt, including the guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes by the
applicable Guarantor; and

(e) is subject to the restrictions on enforcement as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and as
described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**_General_**

As of March 31, 2014, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering, but not the Acquisition, the
Issuer and the Guarantors would have had total consolidated third-party debt (which excludes
Subordinated Shareholder Funding) of e673.1 million. We would also have had e70.0 million available to
draw under the Revolving Credit Facility. As indicated above and as discussed in detail below under the
caption ‘‘—Guarantees—Subordination and Limitations of the Guarantees,’’ payments under the
Guarantees will be subordinated to the payment of Senior Debt of the relevant Guarantor. The Indenture
will permit the Issuer and the Guarantors to Incur additional Senior Debt.

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer depends
on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The
Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any
right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will
be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the
Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of
the Issuer or such Guarantor would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security in the assets of
the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of
March 31, 2014, the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors would have had e9.6 million of
indebtedness and e65.9 million of trade payables and other liabilities outstanding, excluding the
provisions, retirement benefit obligations and FIT liabilities. All of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are
‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be
permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further,
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee the Notes.

192


-----

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (the ‘‘Non-Guarantor Restricted
**Subsidiaries’’) may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial.**

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on December 1, 2019 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The
Issuer will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of e20.0 million in this Offering. Subject to
the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt,’’ the Issuer is permitted to
issue additional Notes under the Indenture from time to time after the Issue Date (the ‘‘Subsequent
**Additional Notes’’). Any issuance of Subsequent Additional Notes is subject to the covenants in the**
Indenture. The Notes and any Subsequent Additional Notes that are issued will be treated as a single
class for all purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, those with respect to waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to
the ‘‘Notes’’ for all purposes of the Indenture and in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ include
references to any Subsequent Additional Notes that are issued.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 9.875% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1. Interest will be payable to Holders of record on
each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the immediately preceding
May 15 or November 15, as the case may be.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on
overdue principal and interest and Additional Amounts and premium if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1%
higher than the then applicable interest rate on the Notes. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes
be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**Form of Notes**

The Additional Notes will be issued on August 5, 2014 only in fully registered form without coupons and
only in denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof.

The Additional Notes will be initially in the form of one or more global notes (collectively, the ‘‘Global
**Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream**
or a nominee of such common depositary. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to in this
description as ‘‘book-entry interests,’’ will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants. The terms of the Indenture provides for the issuance of
definitive registered Notes in certain circumstances. See the section entitled ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form.’’_

**Transfer**

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

All transfers of book-entry interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by
Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking and their respective participants. See the
section entitled ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as definitive registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of e100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the
form of definitive registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any taxes
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any definitive
registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

193


-----

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date;

(d) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Excess Proceeds Offer.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, and
interest on the Notes, at its office or through an agent in London, England that it will maintain for these
purposes. Initially, that agent will be the office of the Principal Paying Agent. Elavon Financial Services
Limited, UK Branch will act as the principal paying agent. The Issuer may change the paying agent
without prior notice to the Holders. In addition, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying
agent in connection with the Notes other than for the purposes of effecting a redemption described
under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or an offer to purchase the Notes described under either of ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’ The Issuer will_
make all payments in same day funds. Payments on the Global Notes will be made to the common
depositary as the registered Holder of the Global Notes.

The Issuer undertakes that it will maintain a paying agent in a member state of the European Union that
will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC (as
amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council
meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or
complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive.

The Issuer maintains a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) with offices in Ireland. The Issuer also maintains a
transfer agent in London. The Registrar is Elavon Financial Services Limited. The transfer agent is Elavon
Financial Services Limited, UK Branch in London.

The Issuer may change the paying agents, the Registrar or the transfer agents without prior notice to the
Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of paying
agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange posted on the official website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu.

No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but
the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental
charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

Under the Indenture, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to guarantee the due and punctual
payment of all amounts payable under the Notes, including principal, premium, and Additional Amounts,
if any, and interest payable under the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are
contractually limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such
Guarantor by applicable law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being voidable or
unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer, or under similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee
will be entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor. Each Guarantee is subordinated to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Debt of that Guarantor.

Certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries organized in the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the
United States guaranteed the Notes on the Issue Date, and on June 4, 2013, TMF (B.V.I.) Ltd. guaranteed
the Notes as a post-closing guarantor (collectively, the ‘‘Guarantors’’).

We pledged the shares of Equity Trust Holdings S.`a r.l and TMF Luxembourg Holding S.A. in the share
capital of TMF Luxembourg S.A. (the ‘‘Luxembourg Regulated Entity’’) to secure the Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging. The Guarantors, excluding the Luxembourg Regulated

194


-----

Entity, represented 60.8% of the Issuer’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2014 and held 52.6% of the Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31, 2014. The
Luxembourg Regulated Entity, together with the Guarantors, represented 82.1% of the Issuer’s
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and held 58.7% of the
Issuer’s consolidated assets as of March 31, 2014.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be
discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(a) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the
‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

(b) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if
the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the covenant
described under ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(c) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’);_

(d) upon a Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that
complies with the provisions under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(e) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance
with the terms of the Indenture;

(f) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to Guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ upon
the release or discharge of the guarantee of Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary that resulted in the
obligation to Guarantee the Notes; provided that no Event of Default would arise as a result and
such Restricted Subsidiary does not guarantee any other Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(g) as a result of any transaction permitted under paragraph (2) or clause (ii) of the final paragraph
under the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets’’;_

(h) in the event that the continuing obligation of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or the continued
existence of such Guarantee would, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, result in a violation
of an applicable regulation or order of a regulator that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented
through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or such Guarantor, and provided that such
Guarantor does not guarantee any other Debt of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or

(i) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers.’’

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee, subject to
receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will execute any documents reasonably required in
order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the consent nor the acknowledgement of the Trustee shall be
necessary to affect any such release. Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to
make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**_Subordination and Limitations under the Guarantees_**

Each of the Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, each such Guarantee
ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Debt of the relevant
Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility
and under the Senior Secured Notes. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors

195


-----

under their Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and
the terms of the Guarantees, and potentially any new intercreditor agreement with the holders of such
Debt (or their duly authorized representatives) (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) entered into
after the Issue Date. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, please
see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under its
Guarantee, as applicable, being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent
transfer or under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or the maximum amount
otherwise permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee will be limited as required to comply with
corporate benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of the relevant
Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligations under its Guarantee. Please see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and Security.’’_

Because of the foregoing subordination and guarantee limitation provisions, it is likely that holders of
Senior Debt and other creditors (including trade creditors) of a Guarantor would recover
disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding
relating to such Guarantor. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to
pay the principal of or interest on the Notes.

**Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture provides that the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Trustee was authorized (without any
further consent of the Holders) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and holders of the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. The Indenture provides that it is subject to the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement and
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see ‘‘Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

In addition, the Indenture provides that at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, any
Incurrence of Senior Debt that is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenants described under the
heading ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’
the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the Trustee may (without the consent of the Holders)
amend the Intercreditor Agreement to reflect such additional Debt or enter into an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement with the holders of such Debt (or their duly authorized representatives) on
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement, including with respect to subordination,
payment blockage, limitation on enforcement and release of Guarantees and priority; provided that any
amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of
the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date.

The Indenture also provides that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by the
Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, respectively; _provided that such Debt is Incurred in compliance with the_
Indenture, (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Subsequent Additional Notes), or
(5) make any other change that does not adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any material respect.
The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’ or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to enter into
any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the

196


-----

Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(a) appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) authorized the Trustee to become a party to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(d) irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Trustee shall not be required to seek the consent of any Holders to perform its obligations under and
in accordance with this covenant.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of
and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of
any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or resident for
tax purposes, or from or through which payment on the Notes or Guarantees is made (including the
jurisdiction of any paying agent) or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’) and any interest, penalties and other
liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’), unless such Taxes are required to be withheld or
deducted from such payments by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or
administration thereof. In the event that any amount for or on account of any such Taxes is required to be
withheld or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or Guarantees, the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (‘‘Additional
**Amounts’’) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of**
the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts) will be not less than the amount that such Holder or beneficial owner would have
received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a
Holder or beneficial owner of any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the Holder’s or
beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
but not limited to, citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a
permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management
present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than the mere receipt or
holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Note, Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the eligible Holder or beneficial
owner of any Note, prior to the relevant date on which a payment under and with respect to the
Notes is due and payable (the ‘‘Relevant Payment Date’’), to comply with the Issuer’s reasonable
written request addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner at least 30 calendar days prior to the
Relevant Payment Date, to provide accurate applicable information with respect to any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity
or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that
the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) which the Holder or
such beneficial owner is legally required and entitled to provide, whether imposed by statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction;

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

197


-----

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to any Note;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation for payment (where
presentation is required in order to receive payment) by the Holder or beneficial owner of a Note on
a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or the
date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that
the Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting
the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period;

(f) any withholding or deduction in respect of any Taxes where such withholding or deduction is
imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to the European
Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN
Council meetings of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive; or

(g) any Taxes that are imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner of
Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant
Note for a payment to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect
of any combination of the above items.

The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of
Taxes required by law and will remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant
taxing authority in accordance with all applicable laws. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain tax receipts from each such tax authority evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the date on which the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due
pursuant to applicable law, copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or relevant
Guarantor or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s or relevant Guarantor’s efforts to obtain such receipts, the
same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment by the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor. Upon reasonable request, copies of tax receipts or other evidence of
payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders or beneficial owners
of the Notes.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is
due and payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to
such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to the
date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will notify
the Trustee promptly thereafter), the Issuer or relevant Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting
forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts
to the Holders and beneficial owners on the payment date. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will provide
the Trustee with documentation satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional
Amounts. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary. The Issuer or relevant Guarantor will promptly publish a notice in
accordance with the provisions set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

The Indenture further provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor conducts business in any jurisdiction
(an ‘‘Additional Taxing Jurisdiction’’) other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is
required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to withhold or deduct any amount on account
of the Taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payment under the Notes or any
Guarantee, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so withheld or deducted but
for such conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Additional Amounts provision
described above will be considered to apply as if references in such provision to ‘‘Taxes’’ included taxes
imposed by way of withholding or deduction by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political
subdivision thereof or therein).

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay (i) any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, transfer, documentation, court, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes,
charges and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto in respect

198


-----

of the execution, issue, delivery, registration of, or receipt of payments with respect to, the Notes, the
Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than, in
each case, on or in connection with a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale of the Notes); and
(ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the
enforcement of the Notes, Guarantee, Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the
occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person to the Issuer or
any Guarantor.

Whenever in the Indenture, this Offering Memorandum or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ there is
mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal (and premiums, if any), Redemption Price, interest
or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note (including payments thereof made
pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include mention of the payment of
Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are or would be payable in
respect thereof.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption prior to December 1, 2015_**

At any time prior to December 1, 2015, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer
may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at a
redemption price of 109.875% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, with the proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Issuer may only do this,
however, if:

(a) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued would remain
outstanding immediately after the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to December 1, 2015, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer
may also redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

**_Optional Redemption on or after December 1, 2015_**

At any time on or after December 1, 2015 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts of
e100,000 or integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed
as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on
December 1 of the years set forth below.

**_Redemption upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if
any, to the redemption date and all Additional Amounts (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional
_Amounts’’), if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the_
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next date on which any amount

199


-----

would be payable in respect of the Notes or Guarantees, would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts
(but, in the case of any Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor
who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) which are more than a
_de minimis amount in respect of the Notes or Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof,_
which the Issuer or relevant Guarantor cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it
(including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction) as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’) affecting
taxation which is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture or,
if such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction has become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the
Indenture, on or after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor person, on or after the date of
assumption by the successor person of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s obligations hereunder); or

(b) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, regulations or
rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction) which is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the date of
the Indenture or, if such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction has become a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
after the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor person,
on or after the date of assumption by the successor person of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s obligations
hereunder) (each of the foregoing clause (a) and this clause (b), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

No right to redeem the Notes will result from a Change in Tax Law affecting payments by a successor
person, unless the Change in Tax Law is publicly announced after the date that such entity first makes a
payment on the Notes. In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Issuer or a
Guarantor conducting business in an Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above), the Change in
Tax Law must be publicly announced after the date the Issuer or relevant Guarantor begins to conduct
the business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Issuer or relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes or Guarantee were then due and (b) unless at
the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have
occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
Issuer or relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a
result of the Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of
independent tax counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions
precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other
directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of 26 and 27 November 2000
on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to
conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.

200


-----

The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor person after such successor_
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption_**

The Issuer will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes described above in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Notices.’’ The Issuer will inform the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange of the principal amount of the Notes that have not been redeemed in connection with
any optional redemption. If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar will
select the Notes by a method that complies with the requirements, as certified to the Trustee and the
Registrar by the Issuer, of applicable law and the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed at such time or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, pro rata or by such
other method as the Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that no
such partial redemption will reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less
than e100,000.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. Neither
the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selection made by the Registrar in accordance with
this paragraph.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the
Notes as described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’ The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and_
from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture contains, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume,
guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become
responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to ‘‘Incur’’
or, as appropriate, an ‘‘Incurrence’’), any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); provided that the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if at
the time of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application
of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for
the four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the
Incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would be greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

(2) This ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted
**Debt’’):**

(a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of Debt under Credit Facilities in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to e70.0 million,
_plus, in the case of any refinancing of any Debt permitted under this clause (a) or any portion_
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuer of Debt pursuant to the Notes (other than Subsequent Additional
Notes) and the Incurrence by the Guarantors of Debt pursuant to the Guarantees (other than
Guarantees of Subsequent Additional Notes);

(c) the Incurrence by the Issuer of Debt pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes and the Incurrence
by the Guarantors of Debt pursuant to the guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes, in each
case issued on the Issue Date;

(d) any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date after giving
effect to the use of proceeds of the Original Notes and the Original Senior Secured Notes;

201


-----

(e) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Debt between the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided
that:

(i) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Debt and the lender of such debt is
not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Debt is (x) unsecured and (y) (except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection
with the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) it is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash (whether
upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the performance in full of its
obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any
transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing to the Issuer
or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case,
be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (e);

(f) the guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Debt was permitted to be incurred by another
provision of this covenant; provided that if the Debt being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari
_passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then such guarantee must be subordinated or pari_
_passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Debt guaranteed;_

(g) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt represented by Capitalized
Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, purchase money obligations or other Debt incurred
for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental
payments or cost of design or cost of construction, installation, maintenance, upgrade or other
improvement of property (real or personal or movable or immovable), or assets (including

reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be

-----

(r) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt to the extent the net proceeds

‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’; and

(s) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt (other than and in addition to
Debt permitted under clauses (a) through (r) above) in an aggregate principal amount at any
one time outstanding, including all Debt incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease
or discharge any Debt Incurred pursuant to this clause (s), not to exceed the greater of
e45.0 million and 4.5% of Consolidated Total Assets.

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, in the event that
an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (a) through (s) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the
paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item
of Debt on the date of its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant. Debt under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding on the Issue Date will initially be
deemed to have been Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of
paragraph (2) above. In addition, any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred pursuant to one of
the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (a) through (s) of paragraph (2) above, or is
entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, may later
be reclassified by the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to any
other applicable clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant to
the extent that such reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such other clause of
paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at the time of such
reclassification.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in euros
where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Euro
Equivalent determined on the date such Debt was Incurred (in the case of term Debt) or committed
(in the case of revolving Debt), or the Issue Date, in the case of Debt outstanding as of the Issue
Date; provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Hedging
Agreement (with respect to euros) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of
such Debt expressed in euros will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.
The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in the same currency as the Debt
being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Debt being refinanced determined on the date
such Debt being refinanced was initially Incurred. If any Debt is incurred to refinance any Debt
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction will be deemed to not have been
exceeded so long as the amount of such Permitted Refinancing Debt does not exceed the amount
set forth in clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Refinancing Debt. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this
‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of
currencies will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(5) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the ‘‘Limitation on
_Liens’’ covenant; and_

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount
or of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest or
dividends in the form of additional Debt,

will not, in any case, be treated as Debt, and with respect to obligations in respect of letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility that are
being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Debt and such letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments relate to other Debt of the Issuer or any

204


-----

Restricted Subsidiary, such other Debt shall not be included for purposes of determining any
particular Incurrence as Debt under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter in which the Original Notes were issued and

the aggregate proceeds received after the Issue Date by the Issuer from the issuance or
sale (other than to any Subsidiary) of Redeemable Capital Stock that has been converted
into or exchanged for the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock, together with, in the case of both
clauses (x) and (y) of this clause (iii), the aggregate proceeds and the Fair Market Value of
marketable securities and other assets received by the Issuer at the time of such
conversion or exchange (excluding Excluded Contributions); plus

(iv) in the case of the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the disposition or

Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a Permitted Investment made
pursuant to clauses (p) or (q) of the definition of Permitted Investment or that was made
pursuant to clause (o) of paragraph (3) below; plus

Subsidiary, or the Unrestricted Subsidiary is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, such amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of any
property or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
respect of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, excluding the

Investment made pursuant to clauses (p) or (q) of the definition of Permitted Investment or
that was made pursuant to clause (o) of paragraph (3) below; plus

after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or
distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for
such period.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may take
the following actions:

(a) the payment of any dividend or consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the date

members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any of its Permitted Holders plus the cash proceeds of any key man life
insurance policies held by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries received after the

The indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Debt as subordinated or junior to secured Debt merely
because it is unsecured or (2) senior Debt as subordinated or junior to any other senior Debt merely
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral.

(1) The Issuer will not Incur any Debt (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Debt of the Issuer unless such Debt is also contractually subordinated
in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; and

(2) No Guarantor will Incur any Debt (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Debt of such Guarantor unless such Debt is also pari passu with, or
contractually subordinated in right of payment to, such Guarantor’s Guarantee on substantially
identical terms,

_provided, however, that no Debt will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to_
any other Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase,
exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with any Affiliate of the
Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater than e2.5 million unless such
transaction or series of transactions is entered into in good faith and:

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially

with respect thereto), in each case (X) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past

loans are actually repaid or (Z) otherwise in an aggregate amount not to exceed e5.0 million
outstanding at any one time under this clause (iii);

(iv) agreements and arrangements existing on the Issue Date (including the agreements and
arrangements described under the caption ‘‘Relationships and Transactions with Related

Issuer’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the
Issuer’s Affiliates;

(xii) payments pursuant to the tax sharing arrangements permitted under paragraph 3(i) under the
heading ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ (without duplication of any such payments);

(xiii) transactions in the ordinary course of business with Shelf Companies; and

(xiv)transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the
requirements of clause (a) of paragraph (1) above.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind
securing Debt upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired (other than
Permitted Liens), except (a) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Debt, the Issuer’s obligations
in respect of the Notes (or the Guarantees in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Debt of the
Guarantors) are directly secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority
to the Lien securing the Subordinated Debt until such time as the Subordinated Debt is no longer
secured by a Lien; and (b) in the case of any other Lien, the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes
(or the Guarantees in the case of Liens securing Debt of the Guarantors), and all other amounts due
under the Indenture are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien
until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to this covenant will provide by its terms that
such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien other than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to the
assets subject to such Lien.

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, than the Issuer will make an offer (a ‘‘Change of Control
**Offer’’) to each Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in minimum**
denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price
(the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’) in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase
**Date’’).**

210


-----

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will:

(a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be published, if at the time of such notice the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, in the Luxemburger Wort (or another leading newspaper of general
circulation in Luxembourg) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and
regulations, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, www.bourse.lu;
and

(b) send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each
Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, which notice
will state:

(i) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

(ii) the transaction or transactions giving rise to the Change of Control;

(iii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which
will be a business day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date such
notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under
the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations;

(iv) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control
Purchase Price is not paid on such date;

(v) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(vi) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control
Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

(3) The Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by it) upon receipt of an authenticating order
from the Issuer, will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount
equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form
or to each Holder of certificated Notes; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal_
amount of e100,000 or in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof; provided that no Holder may
tender any Notes if as a result of such tender, such Holder would hold less than e100,000 of Notes.
The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a
third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the
times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at
least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such tender offer. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control
Offer if the Issuer has, prior to the time that is required to send a notice of the Change of Control
Offer to the Trustee pursuant to clause (2) above, delivered notice to the Trustee of its intention to
redeem Notes as described under the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption.’’

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-l
under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a
Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the
Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control would also constitute a
change of control under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and could constitute a default under the
Revolving Credit Facility. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain
descriptions of certain events that, if they occurred, would require such debt to be repurchased. In
addition, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and any such future debt, even if the

211


-----

Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors of
such repurchase.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, and may be conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time of Change of
Control Offer is made.

The provisions of the Indenture does not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in
the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction
that may adversely affect Holders, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.
Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture,
including those described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence, however, of a Holder of the
Notes’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter
a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a
Change of Control.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have
available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be
delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were
available, the terms of the other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the
Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any
such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfill its repurchase
obligations to Holders who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not
made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure
would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders the rights described
under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’ An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, would result in a
cross default under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of Other
_Indebtedness,’’ including under the Revolving Credit Facility._

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Please see the section entitled ‘‘—Amendments
_and Waivers.’’_

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale
unless:

(a) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Sale is not
less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors); and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of
such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such
Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the footnotes thereto) (other than contingent

212


-----

liabilities and Subordinated Debt), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such liabilities or (y) Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of
such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (c) or (e) of paragraph (2) of
this covenant;

(v) consideration consisting of Debt (other than Subordinated Debt) of the Issuer or any
Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but
only to the extent that such Debt has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor;

(vi) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one
time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of e40.0 million and 4.0% of Consolidated Total
Assets (with the Fair Market Value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value); _provided that Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this_
covenant other than deferred consideration or securities representing deferred
consideration shall not exceed the greater of e10.0 million and 1.0% of Consolidated Total
Assets; or

(vii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of this
paragraph (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Sale, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Sale and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(a) repay or prepay any then outstanding Senior Debt;

(b) redeem Notes or purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price equal to
at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest (at the option of
the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary);

(c) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) to make a capital expenditure;

(e) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) not classified as
current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business;

(f) to repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay Pari Passu Debt other than Senior Debt; provided that
the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) shall make an offer to all Holders on a pro
_rata basis to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an_
Excess Proceeds Offer;

(g) any combination of the foregoing; or

(h) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (c), (d) or
(e) of this paragraph, _provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the
expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated
by that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes
‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

213


-----

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds e15.0 million, the Issuer will, within 15
Business Days of the end of the applicable period in paragraph (2) above, make an offer to
purchase (an ‘‘Excess Proceeds Offer’’) from all Holders and from the holders of any Pari Passu
Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a _pro rata basis, in accordance with the_
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the
maximum principal amount (expressed as a minimum amount of e100,000 and integral multiples of
e1,000 in excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the
amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will
be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal
amount of such Note and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the
principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt, plus, in each case,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu
Debt for purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders
thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt to be purchased will be selected by the Registrar or the Principal Paying Agent on a pro rata
basis (based upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such
Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and
Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of
e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not later than 60 days
from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as
may be required under the Exchange Act.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws
and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are
then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this ‘‘Limitation on
_Asset Sales’’ covenant by virtue thereof._

**_Limitation on Holding Company Activities_**

The Issuer must not carry on any business or own any assets other than (a) the ownership of Capital
Stock of the Company (or a Successor Guarantor following a transaction that complies with the
provisions described in ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’; provided that
in such a transaction where the Company ceases to exist, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company
will be released and will be replaced with a new share pledge (on terms substantially identical to the
existing Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company) over the Capital Stock of the Successor Guarantor);
(b) the provision of administrative services (excluding treasury services) and management services to its
Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership
of assets necessary to provide such services; (c) the offering, sale, issuance and servicing, purchase,
redemption, refinancing or retirement of the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or the incurrence of
other Debt permitted by the terms of the Indenture or performance of the terms and conditions of such
Debt, including on-loans of proceeds from the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other Debt
Incurred in accordance with the Indenture, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under
the Indenture and the granting of Liens permitted pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on Liens’’ covenant;
(d) exercising rights and obligations arising under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Revolving Credit Facility and any agreement relating to other Debt Incurred in accordance with
the Indenture; (e) making Investments in the Notes and other Debt Incurred in accordance with the
Indenture; (f) activities directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance
of its or its Subsidiaries corporate existence; or (g) other activities not specifically enumerated above that
are de minimis in nature.

214


-----

**_Additional Guarantees_**

(1) The Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly
or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any manner become liable with respect to
any other Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously
executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Guarantee of the payment of the
Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be subordinated to any Senior Debt of
such additional Guarantor.

(2) Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law or regulation.

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary
to Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law, regulation or order of
a regulator which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures
reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary or any liability for the officers,
directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

(4) The Indenture will provide that any such additional Guarantee will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged in the circumstances described under ‘‘General—Release
_of Guarantees.’’_

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of
any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, in each case to
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination
of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each
case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees, the
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the guarantees of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements, the security documents in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
and/or Revolving Credit Facility and encumbrances or restrictions contained in any other
agreement in effect on the Issue Date and any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, extensions, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; _provided that such_
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, extension, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer’s Board
of Directors, no more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances or
restrictions than those contained in the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, extension, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement
or refinancing;

215


-----

(b) encumbrances and restrictions: (i) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any properties or assets that are subject to a lease, license,
conveyance or other similar agreement to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a
party; and (ii) contained in operating leases for real property and restricting only the transfer of
such real property upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default in the payment
of rent;

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person
acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but
not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to
any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or
assets of the Person, so acquired;

(d) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any Permitted Refinancing Debt; provided that the
restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Debt are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing
the Debt being refinanced (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets
permitted by the ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant with respect to the assets or Capital
Stock to be sold pursuant to such contract or in customary merger or acquisition agreements
(or any option to enter into such contract) for the purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or
assets or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries by another Person;

(f) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law, regulation or order or by
governmental licenses, concessions, franchises or permits or required by any regulatory
authority, including in respect of funds or assets held for clients and any restriction on funds or
assets arising where a Restricted Subsidiary acts as a trustee, bare trustee, agent, custodian,
nominee, fiduciary or in a similar capacity, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(g) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

faith; _provided that such encumbrance or restriction is applicable only to such Restricted_
Subsidiary;

(i) customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection with purchase money obligations,
mortgage financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business;

(j) any encumbrance or restriction arising by reason of customary non assignment provisions in

(k) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’ that limit the right to dispose of the assets subject to the Liens;

(l) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or
required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(m) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements in respect of hedging
obligations Incurred under clause (i) of the definition of Permitted Debt; or

(n) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Debt permitted to be Incurred after the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially
more disadvantageous to the Holders than is customary in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) and either: (x) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes as and when they come due; or (y) such encumbrance or
restriction applies only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating
to such Debt.

216


-----

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly
established Subsidiaries) to be an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such
designation; and

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’
covenant in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the net assets of such Subsidiary.

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment
constituting a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Payment pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ covenant, as determined by the Issuer, in an amount equal to the Fair Market_
Value of the net assets of such Subsidiary.

(3) The Indenture will further provide that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will at any
time:

(a) provide a guarantee of, or similar credit support to, any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary
(including of any undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Debt); (other than a
pledge Capital Stock or Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary on a non-recourse basis as long as
the pledgee has no claim whatsoever against the Issuer other than to obtain such pledged
property), except to the extent permitted under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and
‘‘Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’ covenants; or

(b) be directly or indirectly liable for any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, except to the extent
permitted under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ and ‘‘Limitation on Transactions with
_Affiliates’’ covenants._

(4) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur and
be continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) if the Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary would be permitted under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant.

(5) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board
of Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors
with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such
designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s
fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the
last fiscal quarter of the Issuer’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

(1) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2012, annual reports containing: (i) information with a level and type of detail that
is substantially comparable in all material respects to the sections in this Offering Memorandum
entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations’’ and ‘‘Business’’; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of_
the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal
year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (b) or (c) below); provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable
expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense; and (iii) the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and

217

as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements;

(b) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Issuer beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2013, quarterly financial statements
containing the following information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income
and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited
condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed

which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense; and (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and any material change

material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of
the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

(2) In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders, beneficial owners of the Notes and prospective
investors, upon the request of such Holders or prospective investors, any information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely
transferable under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

(3) The Issuer shall also make available copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee; (a) on the Issuer’s
website and (b) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the
Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the paying agent in Luxembourg.

(4) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth in clause (1) above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

(5) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(6) All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant shall be made in the English
language.

(7) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(a) Within 10 Business Days after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports
required by clauses (1)(a) and (b), hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the
results of operations for the relevant reporting period; and

(b) Issue a press release to an internationally recognized wire service no fewer than three Business
Days prior to the date of the conference call required by the foregoing clause 7(a), announcing

218

the time and date of such conference call and either including all information necessary to
access the call or directing Holders, beneficial owners of the Notes, prospective investors,
broker dealers and securities analysts to contact the appropriate person at the Issuer to obtain
such information.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

(1) The Issuer will not, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’
properties and assets to any other Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the
time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer)
formed by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or
to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially
all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, the United States of America, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia; and

(y) will expressly assume, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements, pursuant to a
supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; and the Notes, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements will
remain in full force and effect as so amended or supplemented;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, no Default or Event
of Default will have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of
transactions on a _pro forma basis (on the assumption that the transaction or series of_
transactions occurred on the first day of the four quarter fiscal period immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate adjustments
with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such _pro forma_
calculation), the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor under
the Indenture) (i) could Incur at least e1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant or
(ii) would have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior to giving
effect to such transaction;

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate (attaching the computations to
demonstrate compliance with clauses (b) and (c) above) and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is
required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the
requirements of the Indenture and that the Notes, the supplemental indenture and the
Indenture constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Issuer or the Surviving Entity,
enforceable in accordance with their terms; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction
of clauses (1)(b) and (1)(c) above;

(e) the Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of
the Issuer’s assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest, on the Notes; and

(f) for as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of

219


-----

the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notify such exchange of any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

(2) Subject to the provisions described under ‘‘—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,’’ no
Guarantor will, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or other combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s properties and assets to any other
Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving
effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either (x) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than
such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being
herein called the ‘‘Successor Guarantor’’) expressly assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional
Intercreditor Agreements, pursuant to supplemental indentures and/or agreements in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or (y) such sale, disposition or consolidation,
amalgamation or combination is not in violation of the covenant ‘‘—Asset Sales’’;

(b) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing;

(c) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that
such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in
connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that the Guarantee and the supplemental indenture constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor, enforceable in
accordance with their terms; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on
an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clause (2)(b)
above; and

(d) the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, the relevant Guarantor under the Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets, the Guarantor will not be released from the obligation
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the Guarantee.

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets’’ covenant shall not restrict
(and shall not apply to): (i) any Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor
or any other Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving
entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer
under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
clauses 1(a) and 1(d) shall apply to such transaction and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal
form of such entity; provided that clauses (1)(a), (1)(d) and (1)(e) above or clauses (2)(a) and (2)(d)
above, as applicable, shall apply to such transactions described in this clause (iv).

**_Business Activities_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other
than Permitted Businesses, except to the extent that would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

220


-----

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder or beneficial owners of the Notes
for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of
the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the
Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents
relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an
inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to
exclude Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such
consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the
payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European
Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith)
would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file
the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any
summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction; or such
solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Covenant Suspension_**

If on any date following the date of the Indenture:

(1) the Notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB� or better by S&P (or, if either such entity
ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the Issuer, the equivalent investment
grade credit rating from any other ‘‘nationally recognized statistical rating organization’’ within the
meaning of Rule 15c3- 1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Issuer as a
replacement agency); and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions under ‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ will be suspended:

(a) ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’;

(b) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

(c) ‘‘—Limitation on Layered Debt’’;

(d) ‘‘—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’;

(e) ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales’’;

(f) ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’;

(g) ‘‘—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(h) ‘‘—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’;
and

(i) clause (c) of paragraph (1) of the covenant described above under the caption ‘‘—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets.’’_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by either such rating agency should subsequently
decline to below Baa3 or BBB�, respectively, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as at and from
the date of such rating decline. The period during which the covenants set forth above are suspended
pursuant to this provision is the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ The reinstatement of any covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly
taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that, with respect to any Restricted
Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as
though the ‘‘Restricted Payments’’ covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension
Period and (2) all Debt incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or

221


-----

issued pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of Permitted Debt. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension
Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

In addition, the Indenture also permits, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which the Notes cease to be rated Baa3 or BBB� as long as the contractual commitments were
entered into during the Suspension Period and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer being rated
Baa3 or BBB�.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this
heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension
of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such
event.

There can be no assurance thereto that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade
rating.

**Events of Default**

(1) Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any
Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon
acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph (1) of the covenant described under the
heading ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary
that is contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee (other than specified in clause (a), (b) or
(c) above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days or more after written notice (i) to
the Issuer by the Trustee or (ii) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt for money borrowed by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if that default:

(x) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt prior to its express maturity; or

(y) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the
expiration of any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required
prepayment) and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of
such Debt has not been extended,

and, in each case, the outstanding principal amount of any such Debt under which there has
been a failure to pay at final maturity thereof or the payment of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates e25.0 million or more;

(f) except as permitted in the Indenture, any Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any such Guarantor, or any Person
acting on behalf of any such Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in
accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture, any Guarantee or the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by
insurance) shall be rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary either individually
or in an aggregate amount, in each case in excess of e25.0 million, which judgments, orders or
decrees are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes
final; and

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership described in the
Indenture with respect to the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary.

222


-----

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(i) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding by written notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders)
may, and the Trustee, upon the written request of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all of the outstanding Notes
immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect
of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(i) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding
Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on
the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

(4) Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee by the Indenture. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or
Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of
Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

(5) The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may,
on behalf of the Holders, (i) waive any past defaults under the Indenture, except a default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in
which case, the consent of the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required and
(ii) rescind any acceleration and its consequences if (x) such rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) all existing Events of Default, other than
the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
and (z) the Issuer has paid the Trustee its compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for any
properly incurred expense, disbursements and advances.

(6) No Holder has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any remedy
thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes have made a written request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory
to the Trustee against loss, liability or expense to institute such proceeding as Trustee under the
Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after
receipt of such notice and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions
inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for the
enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest
on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

(7) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee
will mail to each Holder of the Notes notice of the Default or Event of Default within 60 days after
being notified of the Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default or an Event of Default in the
payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee
may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if a committee of its trust officers
in good faith determines that withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of the
Holders.

(8) The Issuer will be required to notify the Trustee within 15 Business Days of the occurrence of any
Default.

(9) The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’) then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Reports to Holders’’ or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Indenture.

223


-----

(10) In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (e) of paragraph (l) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Notes shall be automatically annulled if, within 20 days after the Event of Default arose, the event
of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such Event of
Default shall have been discharged in full and if (X) the annulment of the acceleration (if applicable)
of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and
(Y) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including
Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Notes, have been cured or waived.

**Defeasance**

(1) The Indenture provides that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity
of the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect
to the outstanding Notes (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be
deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except
as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes,
replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in
respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

(2) In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant
**Defeasance’’) and thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default**
or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs,
certain events described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. These events will not include events relating to nonpayment, bankruptcy,
insolvency and receivership. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of
whether it has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

(3) In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee (or such
other entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of the Holders, cash in
euro, European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium,
if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on
the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the
Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (x) the Issuer has received from, or
there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (y) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that (and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that) the Holders and beneficial
owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the Holders and beneficial
owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income

224


-----

tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit);

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing
of funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders over the other creditors of the
Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or
other creditors, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing
debts of the Issuer to the detriment of the relevant creditors; and

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel,
each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

(4) If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of
any acceleration occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain
liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Trustee for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euro or
European Government Obligations sufficient, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes
that have not, prior to such time, been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the
date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been
deposited on trust or segregated and held on trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to
the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation: (x) have
become due and payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise);
(y) will become due and payable within one year of Stated Maturity; or (z) are to be called for
redemption within one year of the proposed discharge date under arrangements satisfactory to
the Principal Paying Agent for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuer’s
name and at the Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by the Issuer under the
Indenture; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a)
and (b)).

225


-----

**Amendments and Waivers**

(1) With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or
supplement the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or waive any Default or non-compliance with any provision of the Indenture; provided
that no such modification, amendment or waiver may, without the consent of the Holders of 90% of
the then outstanding Notes:

(a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of Additional Amounts or
interest on, any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate
of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of
Default related thereto);

(c) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional
Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;

(d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance
with the provisions of such Note, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements;

(e) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to any amendment,

(ii) to add to the Issuer’s covenants and those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of
the Notes for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the

Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(iii) to cure any ambiguity or mistake or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture, the
Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the Indenture, the Notes, any
Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or make any

benefit of the Holders of the Notes as security for the payment and performance of the Issuer’s
and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture, in any property, or assets, including any

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including opinions of counsel and Officer’s Certificates.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction or consent or any amendment, modification or other change to the Indenture, Notes owned by
the Issuer or by an Affiliate of the Issuer will be disregarded and treated as if they were not outstanding.

**Currency Indemnity**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a
currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court
of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the
Trustee or a Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such Holder from the
Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase euro on that date, on
the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that could be recovered following such a
purchase is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer
and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the recipient against the cost of the recipient’s
making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes of this
paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual
purchase of euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or
recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would
have been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Notices**

Notices regarding the Notes will be published, if and for as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, in a newspaper having a
general circulation in Luxembourg (which is currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort), or to the
extent and in the manner permitted by the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange,
posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, www.bourse.lu.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, notices will also be given in
accordance with any applicable requirements of such securities exchange.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release will be
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Trustee**

The Indenture contains limitations on the rights of the Trustee under the Indenture in the event the
Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction.

The Issuer and each Guarantor has each irrevocably appointed Lords Securities Corporation as its
agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and

Manhattan, City of New York, State of New York and each of the parties to the Indenture has submitted to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. federal or state courts located in The Borough of Manhattan,

Consolidated Fixed Charge Covering Ratio shall be treated in accordance with IFRS).

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Additional Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Notes’’). Each series of Additional Notes sold to non-US
persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The
Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’ and, together with
the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories.
Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in
definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to
own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or its nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the respective Indentures. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any
rights of holders of the Notes under the respective Indentures.

**Neither of the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the**
**records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.**

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of its Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit its participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of
less than e100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its
nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as
described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts’’ or ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Notes—Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then,_
to the extent described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts’’ or

250


-----

‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Amounts,’’ above, as the case may be, the Issuer will pay
such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by any holder of
the relevant Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding are not
less than the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such
Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The
Issuers expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the respective Indentures, the Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant agents will treat the
registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as
the owner thereof the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of
the Issuers, the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Global Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
pounds sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of a Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise
any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the relevant Notes, Euroclear and
Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes
for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’), and to distribute
such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires
physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the relevant Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with

251


-----

Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’ if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to the
Notes. See ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of each Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

1. if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

2. if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an event of default under the relevant Indenture and enforcement action is
being taken in respect thereof under the relevant Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the relevant Indenture,
unless that legend is not required by such indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will
be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a
means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the

252


-----

settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither of the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchaser
is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Additional Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, the
Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or
their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain Netherlands Tax Considerations**

The following general summary of certain Dutch taxation matters is based on the laws, published
regulations and practice of the Netherlands in force as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and is
subject to any changes in law in the Netherlands and the interpretation and application thereof, which
changes could be made with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to
acquire, hold or dispose of a Note, and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to
all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules, such as trusts or similar
arrangements.

For the purpose of this summary, the term ‘‘entity’’ means a corporation as well as any other person that
is taxable as a corporation for Dutch corporate tax purposes.

Where this summary refers to a holder of a Note, an individual holding a Note or an entity holding a Note,
such reference is restricted to an individual or entity holding legal title to as well as an economic interest
in such Note.

Where this summary refers to ‘‘the Netherlands’’ or ‘‘Dutch’’ it refers only to the European part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

Investors should consult their professional advisers on the tax consequences of their acquiring, holding
and disposing of a Note in their specific circumstances. The discussion below is included for general
information purposes only.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments made by the Issuer under the Notes can be made free of withholding or deduction of any
taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

Please note that the summary in this section does not apply to any holder of a Note:

- being an individual for whom the Notes or the income or capital gains derived therefrom are
attributable to activities performed by such holder which are taxed as employment income in the
Netherlands or to activities performed by certain individuals related to such holder which are taxed
as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) at the level of such
holder;

- being an individual or entity who holds or is deemed to hold a substantial interest in the Issuer as
defined below; or

- being an entity that is, in whole or in part, not subject to or is exempt from Dutch corporate income
tax, including but not limited to a pension fund, a fiscal investment institution (fiscale
_beleggingsinstelling) or an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) as_
defined in the 1969 Corporate Income Tax Act (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969).

Generally speaking, an individual has a substantial interest in a company if (a) such individual,
either alone or together with his partner, directly or indirectly has, or is deemed to have or (b) certain
relatives of such individual or his partner directly or indirectly have or are deemed to have (i) the
ownership of, a right to acquire the ownership of, or certain rights over, shares representing 5% or
more of either the total issued and outstanding capital of such company or the issued and
outstanding capital of any class of shares of such company, or (ii) the ownership of, or certain rights
over, profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) that relate to 5% or more of either the annual
profit or the liquidation proceeds of such company.

Generally speaking, a non-resident entity has a substantial interest in a company if such entity,
directly or indirectly has (i) the ownership of, a right to acquire the ownership of, or certain rights
over, shares representing 5% or more of either the total issued and outstanding capital of such
company or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of the company, or (ii) the
ownership of, or certain rights over, profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) that relate to 5%

254


-----

or more of either the annual profit or the liquidation proceeds of such company. An entity holding a
Note has a deemed substantial interest in a company if such entity has disposed of or is deemed to
have disposed of all or part of a substantial interest on a non-recognition basis.

_Resident entities_

An entity holding a Note which is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for Dutch corporate tax
purposes, will be subject to Dutch corporate tax in respect of income or a capital gain or loss derived
from a Note at the prevailing statutory rates.

_Resident individuals_

An individual holding a Note who is, is deemed to be, or has elected to be treated as, resident in the
Netherlands for Dutch income tax purposes will be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of income or a
capital gain or loss derived from a Note at progressive rates up to 52% if:

- the holder derives profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant
to a co-entitlement to the net worth (medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of such enterprise (other
than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or

- the income or capital gain or loss qualifies as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit
_overige werkzaamheden) as defined in the 2001 Income Tax Act (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001),_
including, without limitation, activities that exceed normal activa asset management (normaal active
_vermogensbeheer)._

If the holder of a Note is an individual whose situation has not been discussed above, such individual
holding a Note will be subject to Dutch income tax on the basis of a deemed return, regardless of any
actual income or capital gain or loss derived from a Note. The deemed return amounts to 4% of the
actual value of the individual’s net assets generally as at the beginning of the relevant financial year
(including the Note). Subject to application of certain allowances, the deemed return will be taxed at a
rate of 30%.

_Non-residents_

A holder of a Note which is not, is not deemed to be, and—in case the holder is an individual—has not
elected to be treated as, resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes will not be subject to Dutch
income tax or corporate tax on income or a capital gain or loss derived from a Note unless:

- the holder of a Note derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as
entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth (medegerechtigd tot het
_vermogen) of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), which enterprise is,_
in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting), deemed
permanent establishment or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the
Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the Notes are
attributable or deemed attributable;

- the holder of a Note is not an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise or a
co-entitlement to the net worth (medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of an enterprise which is
effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes or payments in respect of
the Notes are attributable (other than by way of the holding of securities);

- the holder of a Note is an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise which is
effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes or payments in respect of
the Notes are attributable (other than by way of securities); or

- the holder is an individual and the income or capital gain or loss derived from the Notes qualifies as
income from miscellaneous activities (belastbaar resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) in the
Netherlands as defined in the 2001 Income Tax Act (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), including,
without limitation, activities that exceed normal active asset management (normaal actief
_vermogensbeheer)._

255


-----

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the occasion of the transfer of a Note by way of gift by,
or on the death of, a holder of a Note, unless:

- the holder of a Note is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the
relevant provisions;

- the transfer is construed as an inheritance or gift made by, or on behalf of, a person who, at the time
of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions;

- such holder dies while being a resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands within 180 days after
the date of a gift of the Notes; or

- the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be a resident of the
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax, amongst others, an individual with the Netherlands
nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he or she has been resident in the
Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his or her death.

Additionally, for Dutch gift tax purposes, amongst others, an individual that does not hold the
Netherlands nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he or she has been resident in
the Netherlands at any time during the twelve months preceding the date of the gift.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Dutch value added tax payable by a holder of a Note in respect of payments in consideration
for the issue of the Notes, in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes, or the
transfer of the Notes (other than value added taxes on fees payable for services in connection with the
transfer of the Notes which are not exempt from Dutch value added tax).

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

The acquiring, holding or disposing of a Note will not be subject to registration tax, stamp duty or any
other similar documentary tax or duty payable in the Netherlands.

**_Residence_**

A holder of a Note will not be, or deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for tax purposes and, subject
to the exceptions set out above, will not otherwise be subject to Dutch taxation, by reason only of
acquiring, holding or disposing of a Note.

**Certain European Tax Considerations**

**_European Union Savings Directive_**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest
payments (the ‘‘EU Savings Directive’’), Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of
another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its
jurisdiction to, or for the benefit of, an individual resident in that other Member State or to certain limited
types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg
and Austria have instead opted to apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting
tax at a rate of 35%, unless during that period they elect otherwise (the ending of such transitional period
being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with
certain other countries). However, during that transitional period, withholding will not apply under the EU
Savings Directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of that payment authorizes exchange of
information instead. Luxembourg has announced that it will no longer apply the withholding tax system
as from January 1, 2015 and will provide details of payments of interest (or similar income) as from this
date.

A number of non-EU countries and territories, including Switzerland, have adopted similar measures (a
withholding system, in the case of Switzerland). On 24 March 2014, the EU Savings Directive has been
amended by the Council Directive 2014/48/EU (the ‘‘Amending Directive’’). The Amending Directive

256


-----

broadens the scope of the requirements described above. Member States have until 1 January 2016 to
adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive. The Amending Directive
will apply from 1 January 2017. The changes made under the Amending Directive include extending the
scope of EU Savings Directive to payments made to, or collected for, certain other entities and legal
arrangements. They also broaden the definition of ‘‘interest payment’’ to cover income that is equivalent
to interest.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (‘‘FTT’’)_**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive for a common FTT
in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the
‘‘Participating Member States’’). The proposed FTT has very broad scope. If introduced in the form
proposed on February 14, 2013, it could apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be
exempt. In May 2014, a joint statement by ministers of the Participating Member States (excluding
Slovenia) proposed a ‘‘progressive implementation’’ of the FTT, with the initial focus on applying the tax
to transactions in shares and some derivatives.

Under the February 14, 2013 proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes
where at least one party to the transaction is established in the territory of a Participating Member State
and a financial institution established in the territory of a Participating Member State is a party to the
transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person or is acting in the name
of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ‘‘established’’ in a
Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the
dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation
between the Participating Member States. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate,
although certain other Member States have expressed strong objections to the proposal. Further, the
legality of the FTT proposal is at present uncertain. The FTT proposal may therefore be altered prior to
any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Prospective holders of Notes are advised to
seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**U.S. Taxation**

The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to
the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to
holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance
companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders (as defined below)
whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, persons liable for alternative
minimum tax, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts and persons holding the
Additional Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle,’’ ‘‘hedge,’’ ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated
transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Additional Notes for cash
pursuant to this offer and who hold the Additional Notes as capital assets within the meaning of
section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ is a beneficial owner of an Additional Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a
corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; (iii) any estate
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust,
or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person. A ‘‘Non-U.S. holder’’ is a
beneficial owner of an Additional Note, other than a person treated as a partnership or other
pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S. holder. If a partnership is a

257


-----

holder of Additional Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a
partnership holding the Additional Notes should consult its tax advisor with regard to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of its investment in the Additional Notes.

Prospective holders of the Additional Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding the Additional Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the
application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of
state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

**Qualified Reopening**

We intend to treat each series of Additional Notes as being issued in a ‘‘qualified reopening’’ for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and thus will treat each series of Additional Notes as part of the applicable
series of Existing Notes. Under this treatment, each series of Additional Notes will be deemed to have the
same issue date and issue price as the applicable series of Existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The Additional Notes, like the Existing Notes, will not have original issue discount. However,
depending on a holder’s purchase price, either series of Additional Notes may have amortizable bond
premium. Special rules governing the treatment of amortizable bond premium are described below
under ‘‘U.S. Holders—Bond Premium.’’

**U.S. Holders**

_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_

A portion of the purchase price of the Additional Notes will be attributable to the amount of interest
accrued prior to the date the Additional Notes are issued, or ‘‘pre-issuance accrued interest.’’ A portion
of the first stated interest payment, due on September 1, 2014, equal to the pre-issuance accrued
interest may be treated as a nontaxable return of such portion of the purchase price rather than as
interest income and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Notes will exclude the amount
of pre-issuance accrued interest.

_Payments of Interest_

Subject to discussions concerning pre-issuance accrued interest and bond premium, payments of
interest on an Additional Note will be qualified stated interest that is taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary
income at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of qualified stated interest will be required to include in ordinary income the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (as determined based on the spot rate of exchange
on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of
such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of foreign
currency so received if it is disposed of after the date of receipt.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in foreign currency
that has accrued with respect to an Additional Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of
such accrued income will be determined by translating such income at the average rate of exchange for
the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate
for the partial period within each taxable year. A U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued interest income using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last day
of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within
five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder may elect to translate such
interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other
foreign currency debt obligations held by the U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent
of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such
interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any,

258


-----

between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (as determined based on the
spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the
U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above)
regardless of whether such foreign currency is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such foreign currency
gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated as U.S. source income or as
an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.

Interest income on a Note will generally constitute foreign source income and will generally be
considered ‘‘passive category income’’ for foreign tax credit purposes. U.S. holders should consult
independent tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit in their particular
circumstances.

Should any Dutch tax be withheld, the amount withheld and the gross amount of any Additional Amounts
paid to a U.S. holder will be includible in such holder’s income at the time such amount is received or
accrued in accordance with such holder’s method of tax accounting. Dutch withholding tax imposed on
a U.S. holder would, subject to limitations and conditions and at the election of such holder, be treated as
foreign income tax eligible for credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or a deduction
in computing taxable income, to the extent such tax is not otherwise refundable. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability, deductibility or refundability of any withholding
taxes. Any Additional Amounts would generally constitute foreign source income and should be
translated into the U.S. dollar value in accordance with the rules governing stated interest as described
above.

_Bond Premium_

If, and to the extent, a U.S. holder’s initial purchase price for an Additional Note (excluding any
pre-issuance accrued interest excluded from the purchase price of an Additional Note, as discussed
above under ‘‘—Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest’’) exceeds the stated principal amount of such Additional
Note, such U.S. holder will be considered to have acquired the Additional Note with amortizable bond
premium equal to such excess. Subject to the limitation described below, a U.S. holder generally may
elect to amortize any such bond premium over the remaining term of such Additional Note using a
constant yield method described under applicable Treasury regulations as an offset to stated interest.
However, because the Additional Notes may be redeemed by us prior to maturity at a premium, special
rules apply that may reduce, eliminate or defer the amount of premium that a U.S. holder may amortize
with respect to the Additional Notes. If a U.S. holder elects to amortize bond premium, such holder must
reduce its adjusted tax basis in such Additional Note by the amount of the premium amortized in any
year. If a U.S. holder does not make this election, the premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss
that would otherwise be recognized on disposition of such Additional Note. Amortizable bond premium
is computed in the foreign currency of the interest payments on the applicable Additional Note. A U.S.
holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S.
dollar value of bond premium amortized with respect to a period determined on the date the interest
attributable to such period is received and the U.S. dollar value of that portion of the bond premium
determined on the date of acquisition of the Additional Note. An election to amortize bond premium will
also apply to all other taxable debt instruments held or subsequently acquired by a U.S. holder on or
after the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made. Such an election may not be
revoked without the consent of the IRS. The rules relating to amortizable bond premium, the
determination of the accrual period for any such bond premium, and the effect of an election to amortize
bond premium, are complex and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
application of these rules in their particular circumstances.

_Sale, Exchange, and Redemption of Additional Notes_

Generally, upon the sale, exchange or redemption of an Additional Note, a U.S. holder will recognize
taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or
redemption (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in
income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Note
(which will not include any pre-issuance accrued interest). Except as discussed below with respect to
foreign currency exchange gain or loss, such gain or loss generally will be U.S. source capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, or redemption the U.S.
holder’s holding period for the Additional Note exceeds one year. Deductions in respect of capital losses
are subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange or

259


-----

redemption, the amount realized will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the
date the payment is disposed of. In the case of an Additional Note that is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder will determine
the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement
date of the sale.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note will generally equal the cost of such Additional
Note to such U.S. holder reduced by any principal payments previously received by such U.S. holder
and any bond premium previously amortized, and the cost of the Additional Note will be the U.S. dollar
value of the purchase price on the date of purchase. In the case of an Additional Note that is traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder,
will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Additional Note by translating the amount paid at
the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a
foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase an Additional Note generally will
not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder.

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders with respect to the purchase and sale of
Additional Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments held by an electing U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange or redemption of an Additional Note that is attributable to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and will generally be treated as
U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. Gain or loss attributable to
fluctuations in exchange rates will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount of the Note, (excluding any pre-issuance accrued interest and any bond premium previously
amortized), determined on the date such payment is received or such Additional Note is disposed of,
and the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Additional Note, determined on the date the U.S.
holder acquired such Additional Note. For these purposes, the principal amount of an Additional Note is
the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Additional Note in foreign currency. Exchange gain or loss will be
recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange or
redemption of the Additional Note. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to
interest income received on the Additional Notes.

_Certain Reporting Requirements_

Certain U.S. holders may be required, subject to certain exceptions including holding the Additional
Notes through certain financial institutions, to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign
Financial Assets) with respect to their interest in the Additional Notes. A U.S. holder who fails to timely
furnish the required information may be subject to a penalty. Accordingly, U.S. holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the requirement to file IRS Form 8938 and any other applicable reporting
requirements.

_Reportable Transactions_

A U.S. holder that participates in a ‘‘reportable transaction’’ will be required to disclose its participation to
the IRS. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss
from the Additional Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the
Treasury regulations (US$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. holder is an individual or trust, or
higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form 8886
with the IRS. A penalty is generally imposed on any U.S. person that fails to timely file an information
return with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable
transaction. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of these
rules.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

Subject to the discussion concerning information reporting and backup withholding below, a Non-U.S.
holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on payments of interest, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on, or gain on the sale of an Additional Note unless such Non-U.S. holder
held the Additional Note in connection with a U.S. trade or business carried on by such Non-U.S. holder
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, such items are attributable to the conduct of a trade

260


-----

or business through a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. holder in the
United States), or in the case of the sale of an Additional Note by a Non-U.S. holder who is an individual,
such individual was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the tax year in which such
gain is realized and certain other requirements are satisfied. If the Non-U.S. holder holds the Additional
Note in connection with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, in the case of certain tax treaties,
the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. holder in
the United States), the Non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis
and, if it is a non-U.S. corporation, may be subject to a 30% U.S. branch profits tax (or lower applicable
treaty rate). If the Non-U.S. holder is an individual that is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year in which gain is realized (and certain other conditions are met), the Non-U.S.
holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an
applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by which capital gains allocable to U.S. sources (including
gains from the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the Additional Notes) exceed capital
losses allocable to U.S. sources. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax
consequences to them of an investment in the Additional Notes in light of their particular circumstances.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Payments of interest, principal and Additional Amounts, if any, and the proceeds from sales of Additional
Notes that are made within the United States or through some U.S.- related financial intermediaries may
be required to be reported to the IRS and backup withholding may apply unless, if the holder is a U.S.
holder, the holder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification
number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements and, if the holder is a
Non-U.S. holder, the holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it is not a U.S. person
or is otherwise exempt.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a holder may be refunded or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, if the holder timely provides the required information to the IRS.

261

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Additional
Notes by (a) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ‘‘Code’’) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that
are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, ‘‘Similar Laws’’) and (c) entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA or any applicable Similar Laws (‘‘Plan
Assets’’)) of any such plan, account or arrangement (each of (a), (b) and (c) a ‘‘Plan’’).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’) and prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA
Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of
the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Additional Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary
should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of
control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest,’’ within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons,’’ within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a prohibited transaction may
be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are ‘‘governmental plans’’
(as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain ‘‘church plans’’ (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or
Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not
subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar
prohibitions under other applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of Additional Notes by
an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a Guarantor or an Initial Purchaser is considered a party
in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In
this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or
‘‘PTCEs,’’ that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Additional Notes. These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts,
PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief
from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain
transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly)
has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to
the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and _provided further that the ERISA Plan_
receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.
There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

262


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Additional Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing
‘‘plan assets,’’ unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a prohibited transaction under
ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**_Representation_**

Accordingly, by acceptance of an Additional Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of the
Additional Note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets
used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Additional Notes constitutes assets of any
Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Additional Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not
constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar
violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the
Additional Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the
potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and
whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Additional Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’)
entered into on July 22, 2014, by and among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchaser, the
Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchaser, and the Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase from
the Issuer the entire principal amount of the Additional Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides for the obligations of the Initial Purchaser to pay for and accept
delivery of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the
cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial
Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchaser may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has agreed,
subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including
the date that is 90 days after the date the Additional Notes are issued, to not, without having received the
prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer, or any of the Guarantors or their
affiliates that are substantially similar to the Notes and the Guarantees.

The Initial Purchaser is offering the Additional Notes, subject to the conditions contained in the Purchase
Agreement, including the receipt by the Initial Purchaser of officer’s certificates and legal opinions. The
Initial Purchaser reserves the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in
whole or in part.

The Initial Purchaser proposes to offer the Additional Notes for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to
Rule 144A. The Initial Purchaser will not offer or sell the Additional Notes except:

- to persons they reasonably believe to be ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ as defined in Rule 144A
under the Securities Act; or

- pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S.

The Additional Notes may not be offered or resold in the United States (as defined in Regulation S),
except under an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or under a
registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of the Additional Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

The Initial Purchaser has advised the Issuer that it presently intends to make a market in the Additional
Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The Initial Purchaser is not obligated, however, to
make a market in the Additional Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at
the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser without any notice.

The Initial Purchaser has also represented and agreed that, (i) it has complied and will comply with all
applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’) with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Additional Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom;
and (ii) it will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the
issue or sale of the Additional Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply
to us.

In relation to each Member State of the EEA that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
‘‘Relevant Member State’’), the Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that with effect from and
including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State, it
has not made and will not make an offer to the public of any Additional Notes which are the subject of the
Offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum in that Relevant Member State, other than:

- to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

- to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the
2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined
in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the
prior consent of the relevant Dealer or Dealers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

264


-----

- in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of Additional Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchaser to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.

The Initial Purchaser has further represented and warranted that it has not made and will not make any
offer to the public of the Additional Notes in the Netherlands, unless such offer is made exclusively to
legal entities, which are qualified investors (as defined in the Prospectus Directive) and to authorize
discretionary asset managers acting for the account of retail investors under a discretionary investment
management contract.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ‘‘offer of Additional Notes to the public’’ in relation
to the Additional Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Additional Notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Additional Notes, as the same may be
varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that
Relevant Member State, and the expression ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC (and
amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the
Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member
State and the expression 2010 PD Amending Directive means Directive 2010/73/EU.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made to investors on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which is ten business days (as such term is
used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of this Offering Memorandum
(such settlement being referred to as ‘‘T+10’’). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date
of this Offering Memorandum or the next six succeeding business days will be required to specify an
alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Additional Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes, Goldman Sachs International (the ‘‘Stabilizing
Manager’’) (or any person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) may over-allot the Additional
Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Additional Notes at a level
higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilizing
Manager (or any person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) will undertake stabilizing action.
Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms
of the offer of the Additional Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no
later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Additional Notes and 60 days after the date of
the allotment of the Additional Notes, and shall be done in accordance with applicable laws.

The Issuer has applied, through its listing agent, to have the Additional Notes admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF Market operated by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer cannot assume that the Additional Notes will be approved
from admission to trading and listing, and will remain admitted to trading and listed on the Euro MTF
Market and listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

From time to time, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide,
certain investment banking, other financial and/or commercial banking services to the Issuer and its
affiliates or former affiliates, for which they have received or may receive customary fees, reimbursement
of expenses and commissions. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have entered and may from time to
time enter into hedging arrangements with the Issuer and its affiliates.

**OFFERING AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Additional Notes offered hereby._

The Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred within the United States (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the
Additional Notes only:

- to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ commonly
referred to as ‘‘QIBs,’’ (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in compliance with
Rule 144A; and

- in offshore transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

We use the terms ‘‘offshore transaction’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

If you purchase Additional Notes in this Offering, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as
follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities
Act are used herein as defined therein):

- You understand that the Additional Notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public
offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Additional Notes and
the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the
future you decide to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Additional Notes, such
Additional Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) in the United
States to a person whom you reasonably believe is a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; (ii) outside the United States in a transaction complying
with the provisions of Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act; or (iii) to the Issuer, in each
case in accordance with any applicable securities laws, and that (B) you will, and each subsequent
holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it of the resale restrictions
referred to in the legend below.

- You are not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act), you are not acting on our
behalf and you are either:

  - a QIB and are aware that any sale of these Additional Notes to you will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB;
or

  - you are purchasing the Additional Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

- You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser or any person
representing the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchaser has made any representation to you
with respect to the Issuer or the offer or sale of any of the Additional Notes, other than by the Issuer
and the Guarantors with respect to the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which
Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your
investment decision with respect to the Additional Notes. You acknowledge that the Initial Purchaser
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering
Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer,
the Guarantors, the Indentures, the Additional Notes and the Guarantees as you have deemed
necessary in connection with your decision to purchase the Additional Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of and request information from the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Initial Purchaser.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Additional Note will contain a legend substantially in the
following form:

OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM
NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A,
(D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR
ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL
LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S
RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (E) TO

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES**
**AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
interests in each of the jurisdictions in which Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary
only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of
these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should
apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under
the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief
description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the British
Virgin Islands.

**European Union**

The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘E.U. Insolvency
Regulation’’), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member
State in which a company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the E.U.
Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The
determination of where a company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. To date, no final
decisions have been made in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in
relation to questions of interpretation of the effects of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation throughout the
European Union.

Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation that a company has
its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of
proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ of a ‘‘debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.’’ The courts have taken into
consideration a number of factors in determining the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a company, including
in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its
business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are
established. A company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ may change from time to time but is determined for
the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at
the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. If the ‘‘centre of main
interests’’ of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U.
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the
territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean a place of operations where
the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of
those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the
company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its center of
main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company
has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ‘‘winding up proceedings’’ listed in
Annex B of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment where either
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of
main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in
the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.

269


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening
main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State
which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is
there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member
State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain
limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any
preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that
other Member State where the company has assets.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’). In the
event of insolvency of the Issuer and any Dutch Guarantor, insolvency proceedings with respect to those
entities would likely proceed under, and be governed by, Dutch insolvency law. Dutch insolvency laws
are different from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and this may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

Under Dutch law, there are two applicable corporate insolvency proceedings: moratorium of payments
(surseance van betaling) and bankruptcy (faillissement). A moratorium or suspension of payments
(‘‘moratorium’’) is a court-ordered general suspension of a debtor’s obligations to its creditors. Its
purpose is to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as going
concern. A moratorium is available at the request of the debtor on the ground that the debtor will be
unable to continue payments when they fall due and could be used as a defense by the debtor against a
bankruptcy application by a third-party. It may be ordered only by the district court located in the district
in which the company has its statutory seat. Upon the filing of the request for a moratorium, the court will
automatically grant the moratorium on a provisional basis and appoint at least one administrator
(bewindvoerder) of the debtor’s estate.

Subsequently, the unsecured creditors must vote in a meeting convened by the court as to whether a
definitive moratorium should be granted. The court will then decide whether to grant a definitive
moratorium or, alternatively, the court may declare the debtor bankrupt. The court will grant a definitive
moratorium unless such moratorium is opposed by either (i) creditors having claims jointly exceeding
one quarter of the total amount of claims represented at the meeting, or (ii) more than one-third of
creditors whose claims are represented at the meeting. A moratorium takes effect retroactively from
0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments.

Bankruptcy is a court-ordered general attachment of the assets of a debtor for the benefit of the debtor’s
collective creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy is to provide for an equitable liquidation and distribution
of the proceeds of the debtor’s assets among its creditors. Bankruptcy may be ordered only by the
district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. An application for
bankruptcy can be made by either (i) one or more creditors of the debtor, (ii) the public prosecutor (if the
public interest so requires), or (iii) the debtor itself, on the grounds that the debtor has ceased paying its
debts. A debtor is considered to have ceased paying its debts if claims of at least two creditors for
payments due remain unpaid. There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if
the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when
they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading,
notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a moratorium of payments (see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets.
Furthermore, all pending executions of judgments and any attachments on the debtor’s assets will be
terminated by operation of law, and any pending litigation on the date of the bankruptcy order is
automatically suspended.

A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. In the
event of bankruptcy, a court will appoint a bankruptcy trustee (curator) at its own discretion, which, in
most cases, will be a practicing lawyer in the Netherlands. The receiver in bankruptcy manages the
bankrupt estate, which consists of all of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that exist on the date on which
the bankruptcy order became final, and of all assets acquired during the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy
estate is not liable for obligations incurred by the debtor after the bankruptcy order, except to the extent

270


-----

that such obligations arise from transactions that are beneficial to the estate. A receiver operates under
the supervision of a bankruptcy judge designated by the court, and thus most of a receiver’s major
decisions require the prior approval of the bankruptcy judge.

Secured creditors can exercise their rights during the bankruptcy as normal. However, the bankruptcy
judge may call a ‘‘freeze-order’’ (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months (consisting of
an initial two months, with a possible two-month extension), during which period the secured creditors
cannot exercise their rights without the approval of the bankruptcy judge. The receiver in bankruptcy can
force secured creditors to enforce their security rights within a reasonable period of time, failing which
the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets and distribute the proceeds. The
receiver in bankruptcy is authorized to make such forced sales in order to prevent a secured creditor
from delaying the enforcement of the security without good reason. If a receiver in bankruptcy does
make a forced sale of secured assets, the secured creditors have to contribute to the general bankruptcy
expenses (algemene faillissementskosten) and will receive payment from the proceeds of that sale prior
to ordinary, non-preferred creditors having an insolvency claim, but after creditors of the estate
(boedelschuldeisers), and subject to satisfaction of higher-ranking claims of creditors. Dutch tax
authorities (belastingdienst) have a preferential claim in respect of the collection of certain taxes
(e.g., social security premiums, wage tax, value added tax, etc.), pursuant to which they are entitled to
attach certain movable property found on the debtor’s premises (bodembeslag). They may take
recourse against such property irrespective of whether any security interests over such property exist.
Excess proceeds of enforcement of security rights must be returned to the debtor in bankruptcy and
may not be set-off against any unsecured claims that the secured creditors may have. Such set-off is, in
principle, only allowed prior to the bankruptcy proceedings.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims need to be submitted to the receiver for verification, and the
receiver makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to
what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors that wish to dispute the
verification of their claims by the receiver will be referred to the claim validation proceedings
(renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim.

Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy order cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge
or mortgage. In that event, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not
covered by the proceeds of the security the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No
interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

Voluntary payments (onverplichte betalingen) made by the debtor to a creditor before its bankruptcy
may be successfully contested by the receiver in bankruptcy if the debtor and the creditor, at the time the
payments were made, knew or ought to have known that any other creditors would be prejudiced by
such payment. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, knowledge of prejudice is presumed from the
debtor and the creditor by virtue of law in a number of situations if voluntary payments were made within
one year before the bankruptcy. Even payments that were due and payable to a creditor may be
successfully contested by the receiver in bankruptcy if (i) the recipient of payment knew that an
application for bankruptcy had already been filed at the time the payment was made or (ii) the debtor
and the recipient of payment engaged in conspiracy in order to benefit the recipient of payment to the
detriment of the other creditors.

A Dutch pledge can serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) only and can only be
enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property is
to be carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions and limitations of the Netherlands Civil
Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke
_Rechtsvordering)._

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**

You may not be able to enforce, or recover any amounts under, the Guarantees of, and security interests
granted by or in, the Issuer or any Dutch Guarantor due to restrictions on the validity and enforceability of
security interests and Guarantees under Dutch law. Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether
security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured
by such security interests. For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which a security interest
will be granted in the assets of the Issuer and the Dutch subsidiaries use a parallel debt structure,
whereby the Dutch subsidiaries, as separate and independent obligations, undertake to pay to the
trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to

271


-----

the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of
the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security
interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt,
and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel
debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes
offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the
creditors are reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested
before a Dutch court and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability
posed by Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by the Issuer and any Dutch Guarantor under a
Guarantee or security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to
debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such Guarantee or
security interest. The validity and enforceability of a Guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in,
the Issuer and any Dutch Guarantors may also be successfully contested by the Issuer and any Dutch
Guarantors (or their receiver in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim. The validity and
enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and our Dutch subsidiaries under a Guarantee or security
interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective receiver in
bankruptcy when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the
interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Netherlands
Civil Code and Netherlands Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the Guarantee and security
interests provided by our Dutch Guarantors may be limited.

A corporate resolution approving the issuance of a guarantee by the Dutch Guarantors or a security to
be provided by the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors may be suspended or voided by the Enterprise
Chamber of the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof Amsterdam)
on the motion of one or more holders of shares or depository receipts issued for shares in such company
who, solely or jointly, represent at least one-tenth of the issued capital or who are entitled to an amount of
in shares or depository receipts issued therefore with a nominal value of e225,000 or such lesser amount
as is provided by the articles of association (statuten) of the relevant company, and persons who are
authorized to do so by the articles of association or under an agreement with such company. The right to
file such motion is further vested in an association of employees which has amongst its members person
working for the enterprise and which has at least two years full legal capacity, and, for reasons of public
interest, the advocate general at the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam. Likewise, the guarantee or security
itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or
voided.

Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document may be withheld under
doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare
_tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses_
afforded by Netherlands law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a
guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence
(misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Furthermore,
under Netherlands law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance
of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise.

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy, the so-called action pauliana provisions. The action pauliana offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitations, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the
relevant person and may be nullified by the receiver in bankruptcy in a bankruptcy of the relevant person
or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed such acts
without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s
bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at
the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of
the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

_Financial Assistance_

Pursuant to Article 2:98c of the Netherlands Civil Code, a Dutch N.V. (naamloze vennootschap) may not
grant loans (leningen verstrekken), provide security (zekerheid stellen), give a price guarantee
(koersgarantie geven) or otherwise bind itself, whether jointly and severally or otherwise with or for third
parties (zich op andere wijze sterk maken of zich hoofdelijk of anderszins naast of voor anderen
_verbinden) with a view to (met het oog op) the subscription or acquisition by third parties of shares in its_
share capital or depository receipts. This prohibition also applies to its subsidiaries
(dochtervennootschappen). It is generally assumed that a transaction entered into in violation of
Article 2:98c of the Netherlands Civil Code is null and void (nietig).

It is generally accepted in the Netherlands that, from a Dutch law perspective, the laws of the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the relevant non-Dutch entities whose shares are directly acquired in an acquisition
are relevant in order to answer the question whether there are financial assistance issues in respect of
the acquisition of a foreign entity. However, there is a minority opposing view according to which Dutch
financial assistance regulations are still applicable whenever any Dutch entity is indirectly acquired as a
part of an acquisition even though its shares are not directly acquired. In such an event, the Guarantees
and security provided by Dutch Guarantors may be held to be unenforceable and this may materially
affect the ability to recover amounts due on the Notes. Furthermore it is the prevailing opinion in Dutch
legal literature that in case of an acquisition of the shares in a Dutch entity, Dutch financial assistance
Rules would also apply to its foreign (non-Dutch) subsidiaries.

In order to enable Dutch subsidiaries to grant Guarantees or other collateral to secure liabilities of a
direct or indirect parent or sister company without violating Dutch rules on financial assistance, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in the
Netherlands. Pursuant to such limitation language, it is agreed between the relevant parties that such
guarantee or collateral is deemed not to be given to the extent the same would constitute a violation of
the Dutch rules on financial assistance.

_Ultra vires_

Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into
by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its receiver in bankruptcy (curator) if the
objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or
should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest
_weten). The Netherlands Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining_
whether the objects of a legal entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal
entity’s articles of association (statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into
account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests
(vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is
jeopardized by the transaction.

_Regulatory Consent_

The enforcement of a security over shares and the exercise by the Security Trustee of voting rights
regarding such shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, such actions are conditional
upon obtaining any consent required by law or regulation.

**Luxembourg**

**_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations_**

Luxembourg insolvency proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Luxembourg
Guarantor’s business and assets and the Luxembourg Guarantor’s respective obligations under the
Notes. Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be more
limited than under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as
insolvency proceedings) may be opened against a Luxembourg Guarantor having its registered office or
center of main interests in Luxembourg:

- bankruptcy (faillite) proceedings, the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any
of its creditors; following such a request, a competent Luxembourg court may open bankruptcy
proceedings if the company (i) is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (cessation des paiements),

273


-----

and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (´ebranlement de cr´edit); if a court finds that these
conditions are met without any request, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings on its own
motion;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors; a reorganization order requires the prior
approval by more than 50% in number of the creditors representing more than 50% of the
company’s liabilities in order to take effect; and

- voluntary composition with creditors (concordat pr´eventif de faillite), upon request only by the
company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors representing at least 75%
of all admitted unsecured claims) and not by its creditors. The court’s decision to admit a company
to a composition with participating creditors triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by
unsecured and by participating creditors while other creditors may pursue their claims individually.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be
affected by a decision of a court to grant a suspension of payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a
Luxembourg Guarantor into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial winding up proceedings
may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating
criminal laws or seriously breaching the provisions of the commercial code and the laws governing
commercial companies. The management of such winding up proceedings will generally follow the rules
of bankruptcy proceedings.

Generally, during the insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by general secured and
unsecured creditors against the company are stayed, while certain secured creditors (pledgees or
mortgagees) retain the ability to settle separately while the debtor is in bankruptcy. Collateral over which
a security right has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors
(except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus of enforcement proceeds is realized). During
controlled management proceedings, enforcement measures are suspended until the final
reorganization order from the adjudicating court, declarations of default and any subsequent
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default may not be enforceable and participating
secured creditors in composition proceedings are required to abandon their security. Under the
Luxembourg Act dated 5 August 2005, as amended, concerning financial collateral arrangements, as
amended (the ‘‘Collateral Act’’), secured creditors holding qualifying collateral in the form of financial
instruments or claims to secure obligations giving right to cash settlement and/or delivery of financial
instruments and/or to assets underlying such financial instruments may enforce their security during the
insolvency proceedings without court approval outside the general body of creditors and satisfy their
claim in order of their priority in the enforcement proceeds.

Liabilities of Luxembourg Guarantors in respect of their Guarantees will, in the event of a liquidation of
such Luxembourg Guarantor following bankruptcy or judicial winding-up proceedings, rank junior to the
cost of such proceedings (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such bankruptcy or judicial
winding-up) and those debts of the Issuer that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential
rights arising by operation of law under Luxembourg law include

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

Luxembourg insolvency law may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a
Luxembourg Guarantor during the hardening period (p´eriode suspecte) (which is a maximum of 6 (six)
months and 10 (ten) days) preceding the judgment adjudicating the insolvency proceedings, in
particular, the granting of a security right for antecedent debt, the payment of debt not due (whether or
not payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means) or of debt due
by any means other than cash or bill of exchange or the sale of assets without consideration or with
substantially inadequate consideration. These transactions must be declared null and void, in all
circumstances, at the request of the competent Luxembourg insolvency official (including any
commissaire, juge-commissaire, liquidateur or curateur or similar official). Further, if the insolvency
official demonstrates that an adequate payment in relation to a due debt was made during the hardening
period to the detriment of the general body of creditors, and the party receiving such payment knew that

274


-----

the company had ceased payments when such payment occurred, the insolvency official has the power,
among other things, to invalidate such preferential transaction. Notwithstanding the above, a financial
collateral arrangement under the Collateral Act entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings
or the entry into force of reorganization measures is valid and binding against third parties or insolvency
officials notwithstanding the hardening period if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the
opening of such proceedings or of the taking of such measures or that it could not reasonably have been
aware of them. Generally, if the insolvency official demonstrates that a Luxembourg Guarantor has given
a preference to any person by defrauding the rights of creditors generally, a competent insolvency
official (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the power to challenge such preferential transaction
(including the granting of security right with fraudulent intent) without limitation of time.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in an automatic
termination of contracts except for personal (intuitu personae) contracts, that is, contracts for which the
identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. However, the insolvency official may choose to
terminate certain onerous contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any
unsecured claim will accrue vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a
material adverse effect on the Luxembourg Guarantor’s business and assets and the Luxembourg
Guarantor’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Luxembourg Guarantor).

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation.

_Financial Assistance_

The Luxembourg Guarantor will guarantee and secure certain indebtedness of the Issuer. Any granting
of a guarantee or a third party security by a Luxembourg guarantor that constitutes a breach of the
financial assistance rules set out at Article 49-6 of the Luxembourg Act dated 10 August 1915 on
commercial companies, as amended, or any other similar provisions (to the extent applicable, as at the
date of this Offering Memorandum, to the Luxembourg Guarantor) may not be enforceable.

There is no Luxembourg legislation or published authoritative court precedent which specifically
regulates the granting of a guarantee or a third party security by a Luxembourg company securing the
indebtedness of a subsidiary, a parent company or an affiliated company. However, the granting of a
guarantee or a third party security is subject to specific limitations and requirements relating to the
corporate object (objet social) and the corporate benefit (int´erˆet social) of the Luxembourg Guarantor.
Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is
widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which a Luxembourg company derives a direct or
indirect economic or commercial benefit. It is generally held that, within a group of affiliated companies,
the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity may, to a certain extent, be subordinated to the
interest of the group. As such, the granting of a guarantee or a third party security securing the
indebtedness of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the
provision of an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or security right for the benefit of a parent or a sister
company may be more problematic but not necessarily conflicts with the interest of the assisting
company. Belgian and French court precedents have retained certain criteria on the basis of which they
have held that a Belgian or French company may validly grant a guarantee or a third party security for the
obligations of a group company and such findings may influence the findings of a Luxembourg court,
which, placed in a similar context, may hold that a Luxembourg company may validly grant a guarantee
or a third party security if certain conditions are met. The test regarding the company’s corporate interest
is whether it is a member of a structured group with a common economic strategy, receives some (direct
or indirect) consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the (direct
or indirect) benefit received from the secured indebtedness is proportionate to the burden of the
assistance. A guarantee that substantially exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its
commitments towards the beneficiary of the guarantee or third party security and to its other creditors
would expose its directors or managers to civil and criminal personal liability and may, inter alia, be
declared null and void based on the concept of illegal cause (cause illicite). The Guarantee granted by
the Luxembourg Guarantors includes general limitation language limiting the financial exposure of the
Luxembourg Guarantors to a certain percentage of, among others, the amount of the sum of the
company’s net assets (capitaux propres) and its subordinated debt (dettes subordonn´ees) as reflected
in the financial information of the Luxembourg Guarantor, covering the aggregate obligations and
exposure of the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor under all finance documents.

_Luxembourg Security Rights_

The appointment of a foreign security agent or trustee will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to
the extent that such designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to
possible restrictions depending on the type of the security right. In general, a security right over financial
collateral may be granted in favor of an agent, a fiduciary or a trustee acting as holder of the security right
for the collateral taker in order to secure the claims of present or future third party secured creditors,
provided that these secured creditors are identified or can be identified. Without prejudice to its
obligations vis-`a-vis such third party secured creditors, an agent, a fiduciary or a trustee acting for these
secured creditors is entitled to the same rights as a secured creditor who is directly holding a security
right granted to its benefit, all in accordance with Article 2(4) of the Collateral Act.

All security rights granted in the form of a pledge over shares qualify as financial collateral arrangements
under the Collateral Act. According to the Collateral Act, all financial collateral arrangements (including
pledges of financial instruments, receivables or cash held on account), as well as the enforcement
events relating to these financial collateral arrangements, are valid and enforceable against third parties
(including supervisors, receivers, liquidators or other similar bodies) irrespective of any bankruptcy,
liquidation or other situations (e.g. hardening period (p´eriode suspecte)), of composition with creditors
or of reorganization affecting any one of the parties, whether they are national or foreign, except in case
of fraud. Where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation
proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such
measures, such arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency
receivers, liquidators or similar bodies, notwithstanding the hardening period (p´eriode suspecte) as
referred to at Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the collateral taker proves
that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been
taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of them, all in accordance with Article 21(2) of the
Collateral Act.

Enforcement proceedings affecting only a portion of the shares of a Luxembourg private limited liability
company (soci´et´e `a responsabilit´e limit´ee), where only part of its shares have been encumbered, require
the approval, by a general meeting of the shareholders of the Luxembourg company, of the transferee or
purchaser (whether known or unknown) of the shares as new shareholder of the Luxembourg company.

The enforcement of security over shares and the exercise by the Security Agent voting rights in respect
of such shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, enforcement of any security over
shares and the exercise by the Security Agent the voting rights in respect of such shares will be
expressed to be conditional upon obtaining any consents required by law or regulation.

**The United States of America**

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance laws, the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the issuance of the guarantees and
the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuer or the Guarantors (together, the
‘‘Obligors’’) could be avoided, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations,
issued the related guarantee or gave the security, the Obligors intended to hinder, delay or defraud any
present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the
incurrence of such indebtedness or the grant of such security and either:

- were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security;

- were engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’ remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

- intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as
they mature.

In those cases where the Obligor’s solvency is a relevant factor, the measures of insolvency will vary
depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has
occurred. Generally, however, a party would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of
its assets;

276


-----

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay
its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

- it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due.

We cannot be sure as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether or not a party was
solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the incurrence of the
obligations under the Notes, the issuance of the guarantees and the grant of security, whether now or in
the future by the Obligors would not be voided or the guarantee would not be subordinated to the
Guarantors’ other debt. If such a case were to occur, the guarantee could also be subject to the claim
that, since the Guarantees were incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the
Guarantors, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favor of the Notes, including pursuant
to security documents delivered after the date of the Indentures, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy
case by the grantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain
events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is insolvent at the time of
the grant, the security interest permits the Noteholders to receive a greater recovery than if the
bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the security had not
been given and a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the
grant, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.

**_The Automatic Stay_**

The right of a Noteholder to enforce its security interests against the Guarantors upon the occurrence of
an event of default under the Indentures is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S.
bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors became a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code before such security interest was enforced. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as a Noteholder is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over,
property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the
Obligors could therefore prevent the Noteholder from obtaining possession or exercising control over
the Collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the
Collateral the automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain
circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the
bankruptcy court deny such a request.

**_Right of Debtor-In-Possession to Remain In Control of Collateral and the Bankruptcy Process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of
its property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a ‘‘debtor-in-possession,’’ subject
to certain limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11
case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even
though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor
is given ‘‘adequate protection’’ of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term ‘‘adequate protection’’ is
not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing
an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral
decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the
use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate
protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court
may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in
the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails
to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within
the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day
period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be

277


-----

extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these ‘‘exclusive periods,’’ other parties
such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own
chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term ‘‘adequate protection,’’ the
exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to
predict:

- whether or when a Noteholder could enforce its security interests;

- the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is
proposed or confirmed; or

- whether or to what extent Noteholders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of
value of the collateral through the requirement of ‘‘adequate protection.’’

**_A Debtor-In-Possession May Obtain New Credit Secured By a Lien That is Senior or Equal to_**
**_Existing Liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an
extension of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may,
depending on the facts and circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new
credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it
is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or
Guarantors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the
liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

**_Ability to Confirm a Chapter 11 Plan Notwithstanding the Dissenting Votes of Creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equityholder (or
class of creditors or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the
comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for
the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type.
Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan.
Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed
to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to
vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it.

A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and
two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the
bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall.
Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to
specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the ‘‘cram-down’’ provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, so long as the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each
class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the
debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**England and Wales**

A number of our subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings with respect to certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law
unless it can be demonstrated that the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ or ‘‘COMI’’ is situated in
another jurisdiction. A company’s COMI should correspond to the place where the company conducts
the administration of its interests on regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The
registered office of a company is presumed to be where the company’s COMI is, unless proven to the
contrary. Therefore, the COMI of a company is determined on a factual basis taking into account where
the company regularly conducts its affairs and where its creditors perceive a company’s COMI to be. As
the English Subsidiary Guarantor is incorporated in England, there is a presumption that the ‘‘centre of
main interests’’ for the English Subsidiary Guarantor is situated in England.

278


-----

English insolvency law may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that we or any one or more of the Guarantors
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings.

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by security interests
over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests of the Notes.

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Guarantees or the Collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_Fixed versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge
security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to
cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses
(which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company) while in
administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created
after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged
assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the liquidator) properly incurred in
a winding-up are payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets the subject of
the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes,
a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary
course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company
so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the
risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) there are
particular challenge risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security is subject
to the claims of preferential creditors (such as certain minimum occupational pension scheme
contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing (see below ‘‘—England and Wales—
Administration and Floating Charges’’).

Under English insolvency law, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests
expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be
upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the
chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is, in fact, exercised by the chargee in
practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee,
the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in
respect of an English company, as applicable, in certain circumstances. An administration order can be
made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’
and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An
administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to
the identity of the appointor. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process
may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property,
except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator (the statutory moratorium).

If an English company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the guarantee
granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of court or
consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances (expanded upon below). No
administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator. Any
administrative receiver already appointed must vacate office, and any receiver already appointed must

279


-----

vacate office if requested to do so by the administrator. Where a company is already in administration, no
administrative receiver may be appointed and a receiver may only be appointed with the leave of the
court or consent of the administrator.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that
company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. The statutory moratorium does not apply
to security interests created or arising under a ‘‘financial collateral agreement’’ (generally, security/
collateral in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market
debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 as amended.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the
company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a ‘‘qualifying
floating charge’’ for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an
administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document predates
15 September 2003 in England, fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 in England. In
order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such
security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating
charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English company’s
assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as
amended (the ‘‘UK Insolvency Act’’), which will apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least
£50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the
issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, but is generally a
rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or
liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of
enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this
applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000,
with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a termination procedure applicable to companies incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales. There are three ways an English Subsidiary Guarantor may be placed into liquidation or
‘‘wound up,’’ being (1) Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent
companies only), (2) Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation, and (3) Compulsory Winding-Up.

On the liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing
the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where an English
Subsidiary Guarantor is placed into liquidation, a creditor holding a valid mortgage, charge or other
security interest has four options: (1) to realize the security, apply the proceeds towards discharge of the
secured debt, and prove in the liquidation for any balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the
liquidation, (3) to value the security and prove for any shortfall between that value and the value of the
debt, and (4) to surrender the security and prove for the full amount of the debt.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. Under insolvency law in England and Wales, the liquidator
or administrator of a company may apply to the court to set aside the granting of security or the giving of
a guarantee prior to the grantor entering into relevant insolvency proceedings, if the grantor was unable
to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act) at the time of, or becomes unable to
pay its debts as a consequence of, the grant of security or giving the guarantee. A transaction that has
occurred within the two years prior to the guarantor entering into relevant insolvency proceedings might
be subject to a challenge if a company received consideration of significantly less value than the benefit
given by that company unless a court determines that the company entered into the transaction in good

280


-----

faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds
for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The two year time period limitation wouldn’t
apply where the transaction was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors. In
addition, a transaction might be subject to challenge where it puts a person into a position which is better
than the position that person would be in if the company proceeded into insolvent liquidation and that
transaction occurred within the two years (in the case of connected persons) or six months (in the case
of unconnected persons) prior to the company entering into relevant insolvency proceedings. The Issuer
cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security or the
giving of the guarantees by companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales would not be
challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that (in any event)
the security and guarantees were entered into in good faith for the purposes described above.

In general terms, in such circumstances the Courts of England and Wales have the power to make void
such transactions, or restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into
the transaction. If a court voided any grant of security or giving of any guarantee as a result of a
transaction at an undervalue or preference, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would
cease to have any security over the grantor or a claim against the Guarantor giving such guarantee.

**Spain**

One of the Subsidiary Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Spain (the ‘‘Spanish Guarantor’’). As
a general rule, in the event of an insolvency of the Spanish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law. The Spanish Act 22/2003 of July 9, 2003 on Insolvency
Proceedings (the ‘‘Spanish Insolvency Act’’), as further amended, regulates court insolvency
proceedings.

**_Concept and Petition for Insolvency_**

In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current insolvency
(insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia imminente). Under the Spanish Insolvency Act,
a debtor is insolvent when it becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due or
when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so. A petition for insolvency may be initiated by the
debtor, by any creditor (provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing
of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature) or
by certain other interested third parties.

_Voluntary Insolvency_

Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor.

The debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should
have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its
insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for
mandatory insolvency occur.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general obligation to file for insolvency within the referred two
months does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable court that it has initiated negotiations with its
creditors to obtain accessions to an anticipated agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the
‘‘Company Voluntary Agreement’’ or the ‘‘CVA’’) or to reach a refinancing agreement set out in article 71
bis.1 or in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the so-called 5 bis
communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, on the top of those two months, the
debtor gains an additional three month period to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain
accessions to an anticipated CVA and one further month to file for insolvency. During such period of
time, creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and court enforcement actions, other
than those arising from public law claims, over those assets deemed necessary for the continuity of the
debtor’s business activities, are prohibited.

_Mandatory Insolvency_

Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a creditor or by certain other
interested third-parties.

Under Section 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can apply for a declaration of insolvency if it
can prove that it has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed. A creditor

281


-----

may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court, inter alia that: (i) there is a
generalized default on payments by the debtor; (ii) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the
generality of the debtor’s assets; (iii) there is a misplacement, ‘‘fire sale’’ or ruinous liquidation of the
debtor’s assets; or (iv) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment
obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months).

_Conclusion of Insolvency: Proposal of Agreement or Liquidation_

The Spanish Insolvency Act provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the
implementation of a CVA or the liquidation of the debtor.

**_Certain Effects of the Insolvency for the Debtor and on Contracts_**

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its powers to manage and dispose of its
business, but is subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrators (‘‘administraci´on
_concursal’’). In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor no longer has power over_
its assets, and management’s powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely
upon the insolvency administrators. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime
subject to the specific circumstances of the case.

Under Section 61 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, all clauses in contracts with mutual obligations that
entitle any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency
are deemed as not included in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly
permitted by specific laws (i.e. agency laws).

A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending on
performance by either the insolvent party or the counterparty, which remain in full force and effect, and
the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. The court can
nonetheless terminate any such contracts at the request of the insolvency administrators, the company
itself or the non-debtor when such termination is in the interest of the estate or if there has been a breach
of such contract. The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return or
indemnify its counterpart.

The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary for the continuation of the
commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the
earlier of: (i) an arrangement of CVA being reached provided that the CVA does not affect such right or
(ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of a liquidation.

**_Ranking of Credits_**

Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month from the
last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency, providing original documentation to
justify such claims. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by
the debtor, the court administrators draw up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them
according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Act.

Under the Spanish Insolvency Act, claims are classified in the following groups:

a) Claims against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la masa) are not considered part of the
debtor’s general debt and are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are
paid before other debts under insolvency proceedings). Debt against the insolvency estate
includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the
insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor
under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency
proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnity in cases of
voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a
clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and
correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain
amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent
debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the
debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to
the debtor under a CVA in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, (viii) 100%
of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the
requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law,

282


-----

provided that such arrangement has been entered into after March 9, 2014 and (ix) 100% of the new
funds lent by the debtor itself or by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor in the
context of a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law, provided that such
arrangement has been entered into after March 9, 2014 and provided further that such new funds do
not result from a share capital increase. From March 10, 2016, only 50% of the new funds referred to
in subsection (a)(viii) will be considered as claims against the insolvency estate, and funds referred
to in subsection (a)(ix) will no longer be considered as claims against the insolvency estate.

b) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem
security). These claims may entail separate proceedings, and are subject to certain restrictions
related to a mandatory waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations
set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. However, within such waiting period or while any
enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the court receiver
has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules.
Privileged creditors are not subject to arrangements (convenios), unless they give their express
support by voting in favor of the arrangement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect
payment against the secured assets.

c) Claims benefiting from general privileges, including, among others, certain labor debts and certain
debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax
debts and social security obligations are recognized as privileged for half of their amount, and debts
held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such
application has been approved, up to 50% of the amount of such debt. New funds under a
refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis
or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt
against the insolvency estate (cr´edito contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The
holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the restructuring (CVA) if they do not agree to
the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order
established by law).

d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a prorate basis.

e) Subordinated claims (which are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law). Debts
subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special
relationships with the debtor, except for those credits that are regarded as debt against the
insolvency estate (cr´edito contra la masa) in accordance with subsection (a)(ix) above and until
March 9, 2016. In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives. In the case of a legal entity, this
includes administrators, group companies and their common shareholders, and any shareholders
holding over 5% (for companies that have issued securities listed on an official secondary market)
or 10% (for companies which have not issued securities listed on an official secondary market) of
the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly
capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with
the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency
Law shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits
against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Claims
related to accrued and unpaid interest unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right
are also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they may not vote on a
CVA and have very limited chances of collection. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this
paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the
acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared
open.

**_Hardening Periods_**

There is no clawback date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the
insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those transactions. Under the Spanish Insolvency
Act, upon the declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed as having damaged
(perjudiciales) the insolvent debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called ‘‘patrimonial damage’’) during the
two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared, may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent

283


-----

intention. Transactions taking place earlier than two years prior to the declaration of insolvency are
subject to the general regime of fraudulent conveyance under the Spanish Civil Code, which requires the
evidence of fraud by the claimant.

The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define the meaning of ‘‘patrimonial damage.’’ Damage does not
refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest
resulting on the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment
among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (pars condition creditorum). There are several
‘‘irrebuttable presumptions’’ expressly set forth by the Spanish Insolvency Act (i.e., free disposals and
prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them being due and where
the due dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of
insolvency), except if such obligations were secured by an _in rem security, in which case such_
transactions are rescinded if they fall within the hardening period. In addition to the above, the Spanish
Insolvency Act sets forth certain actions which are deemed to cause a ‘‘patrimonial damage’’ to the
insolvent company, but which are ‘‘rebuttable presumptions’’ and therefore subject to being contested
by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of ‘‘specially related parties’’ (as described above), the
provision of security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations
replacing existing ones and the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in
rem security and which mature after the declaration of insolvency). Ordinary transactions carried out
within the debtor’s ordinary course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried
out at arm’s length.

A recent amendment of the Spanish Insolvency Act has excluded certain types of refinancing
agreements from the scope of claw-back actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted
in execution of such agreements.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be the secured parties under the security interests
governed by Spanish law. Under Spanish law, a security interest created as security for the benefit of
third parties who are not direct parties to the relevant agreement creating the security interest are
unenforceable by such parties. The Intercreditor Agreement provides (shall provide) for the creation of a
parallel debt structure (as an abstract obligation independent from the obligation under the Notes)
whereby, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all the Debtors (as defined therein)
undertake to pay to the Spanish co-security agent any amount payable by them under the Notes. This
allows the Spanish co-security agent to be the beneficiary of the security interest governed by Spanish
law. The use of parallel debt in Spanish deals is a new concept, and there has not been any court
precedent to ensure its validity and enforceability. Also, the registration of the security interests governed
by Spanish law may be rejected if the relevant registrar considers that this structure is not valid or
enforceable.

**_Spanish Guarantor_**

Under Spanish law, the guarantee to be granted pursuant to the Indenture may only be granted by those
guarantors that are incorporated as stock companies under the laws of Spain (sociedades an´onimas or
_‘‘S.A.’’). This is due to the fact that all other subsidiaries which are incorporated as limited liability_
companies under the laws of Spain (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada or ‘‘S.L.’’) are subject to the
prohibition contained in Article 402 of the Spanish Capital Companies Law (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el Texto Refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de_
_Capital) (the ‘‘Spanish Capital Companies Law’’), which states that a limited liability company cannot_
execute or secure a bond issuance or other issuance of securities.

**_Spanish Financial Assistance Limitations on Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Spanish Capital Companies Law prohibits financial assistance for stock companies (‘‘sociedades
_an´onimas’’ or ‘‘S.A.’’) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of their direct or_
indirect controlling company.

A guarantee or indemnity granted or assumed pursuant to the Indenture by the Spanish Guarantor or
any security interest created by the Spanish Guarantor may not extend to any obligation related to the
acquisition of the shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or, in the case of
stock companies (‘‘sociedades an´onimas’’ or ‘‘S.A.’’) shares representing the share capital of their

284


-----

direct or indirect controlling companies, or in the case of limited liability companies (‘‘sociedades de
responsabilidad limitada’’ or ‘‘S.L.’’), shares representing the share capital of companies belonging to
the group of such Spanish Guarantor, or to the refinancing of a previous debt incurred for the acquisition
of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share
capital of their direct or indirect controlling companies. There is, therefore, a risk that the obligations
assumed by the Spanish Guarantor pursuant to the security intended to be created or guarantees to be
granted pursuant to the Indenture could be considered financial assistance under the Spanish Capital
Companies Law to the extent that they refer to an institution of guarantees in connection with the prior
acquisition of shares in the Spanish Guarantor or their direct or indirect controlling companies.

**_Trust under Spanish law_**

There is no concept of a trust under Spanish law. If Spanish law security documents are entered into only
by a security agent (i.e., and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the security
agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the Guarantees or the security interest in respect of those
obligations. However, there is a risk that a security agent would only be able to enforce against the debt it
individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent.
This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant formal powers of attorney in favour of the security
agent in order for the latter to represent them in the enforcement proceedings.

**British Virgin Islands**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under BVI insolvency law, a liquidator of the BVI company could apply to the court to set aside the
granting of a guarantee or security interest if the liquidator believed that the granting of such was an
unfair preference. Such a transaction might be subject to being set aside if it is entered into at a time
when the BVI company is insolvent or it causes the BVI company to become insolvent, the transaction
was entered into within two years (six months where the person is not a connected person) prior to the
onset of insolvency and the transaction has the effect of putting a creditor in a position which, in the
event of the BVI company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have
been in if the transaction had not been entered into. Upon such application, the court can make such
order as it thinks fit to restore the BVI company to the position it would have been had it not entered into
the transaction. A court will generally not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the transaction took
place in the ordinary course of business.

A liquidator may apply to the court for an order to set aside the granting of a guarantee or security
interest if the liquidator believed that the granting of such was an undervalue transaction. Such a
transaction might be subject to being set aside if it is entered into at a time when the BVI company is
insolvent or it causes the BVI company to become insolvent, the transaction was entered into within two
years (six months where the person is not a connected person) prior to the onset of insolvency and the
BVI company makes a gift to a person or otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on terms
that provide for the BVI company to receive no consideration, or the BVI company enters into the
transaction for consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the
value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the BVI company. A court will
generally not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the BVI company entered into the transaction in
good faith and for the purposes of its business and, at the time it entered into the transaction, there were
reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the BVI company.

Where a floating charge is created by a BVI company within two years (six months where the person is
not a connected person) prior to the onset of insolvency and it is entered into at a time when the BVI
company is insolvent or it causes the BVI company to become insolvent, then it is liable to be set aside. A
court may not set aside the floating charge if it is satisfied that the floating charges secures: money
advanced or paid to the BVI company, or at its direction, at the same time as, or after, the creation of the
charge; the amount of any liability of the BVI company discharged or reduced at the same time as, or
after, the creation of the charge; the value of assets sold or supplied, or services supplied, to the BVI
company at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge; and the interest, if any, payable on the
amount referred to above pursuant to any agreement under which the money was advanced or paid, the
liability was discharged or reduced, the assets were sold or supplied or the services were supplied.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**

The general impediments to enforcement of guarantees in the British Virgin Islands include the
following:

- enforcement of obligations and the priority of obligations may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, readjustment of debts, disclaimer of onerous property in liquidation or
moratorium and other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors or by
prescription or lapse of time;

- enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity and, in particular, the availability of
certain equitable remedies such as injunction or specific performance of an obligation may be
limited where the court considers damages to be an adequate remedy;

- claims may become barred under statutes of limitation or may be or become subject to defenses of
set-off, counterclaim, estoppel and similar defenses;

- where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the British Virgin Islands, they may
not be enforceable in the British Virgin Islands to the extent that performance would be illegal under
the laws of or contrary to the public policy of, that jurisdiction;

- in liquidation proceedings in respect of a BVI company before a court of the British Virgin Islands the
Insolvency Act, 2003 of the British Virgin Islands requires that the amount of a claim based on a
liability incurred or payable in a currency other than United States dollars shall be converted into
United States dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the relevant time. For such purposes, the
rate of exchange should be ascertained in such manner as may be prescribed by the Insolvency
Rules, 2005 of the British Virgin Islands.

- to the extent that any provision of the guarantee is adjudicated to be penal in nature, it will not be
enforceable in the courts of the British Virgin Islands; in particular, the enforceability of any provision
of the guarantee which imposes additional obligations in the event of any breach or default, or of
payment or prepayment being made other than on an agreed date may be limited to the extent that
it is subsequently adjudicated to be penal in nature and not an attempt to make a reasonable
pre-estimate of loss;

- to the extent that the performance of any obligation arising under the guarantee would be fraudulent
or contrary to public policy, it will not be enforceable in the courts of the British Virgin Islands;

- a BVI court will not necessarily award costs in litigation in accordance with contractual provisions in
this regard;

- enforcement may be limited unless the Directors of the BVI company consider the giving of the
guarantee and the transactions contemplated thereby to be in the best interests of the BVI
company; and

- the effectiveness of terms in the guarantee excusing any party from a liability or duty otherwise owed
or indemnifying that party from the consequences of incurring such liability or breaching such duty
shall be construed in accordance with, and shall be limited by, applicable law, including generally
applicable rules and principles of common law and equity.

To the extent that security is taken over the shares of the BVI company by way of charge or equitable
mortgage, it should be noted that for as long as the security provider (‘‘Chargor’’) is the registered holder
of the shares in the BVI company the subject of security (‘‘Charged Shares’’) it will, from the perspective
of the BVI company, remain entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions as may be payable
in respect of the Charged Shares in the BVI company and to exercise any voting and other rights and
powers attaching to the Charged Shares. Pursuant to the Articles of Association of the company, the
Directors may resolve to refuse or delay the registration of any transfer of shares.

The registered holder of the shares in the BVI company and the directors of such company would have
the power, as a matter of BVI law, to alter the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the BVI
company to introduce provisions which may restrict the ability of the secured party to enforce their rights
over the Charged Shares or realize their security by selling the Charged Shares to third parties.

With respect to security over the Charged Shares, the priority among competing equitable interests will,
if BVI domestic law is applied, be determined according to the time of creation of the equitable interest
and, accordingly, the security interest over the Charged shares would rank behind any pre-existing
equitable interest in the Charged Shares. Such security interest may also rank behind any security

286


-----

interests granted over the Charged Shares in the nature of a legal mortgage and/or a bona fide
purchaser for value of the Charged Shares without notice of the security could obtain good title to the
Charged Shares; although please note that it does not necessarily follow that, as a matter of BVI conflict
of law rules, priorities of competing interests in the Charged Property will be determined according to BVI
domestic rules.

For the purposes of determining matters relating to title and jurisdiction but not for the purposes of
taxation, the situs of the ownership of shares, debt obligations or other securities of the BVI company is
in the British Virgin Islands. Registered shares in the BVI company are transferred by a written instrument
of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee and is
effective when the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of Members of the BVI company. The
instrument of transfer must also be signed by the transferee where registration as a holder of the share
imposes a liability to the BVI company on the transferee.

The enforcement of a security over shares and the exercise by the Security Trusee of voting rights
regarding such shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, such actions are conditional
upon obtaining any consent required by law or regulation.

287

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

We and some of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in the Netherlands. Other Guarantors are
organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain, the United States and the British
Virgin Islands, and future Guarantors may also be organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. All
of our directors and executive officers and all of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Although we and each of the Guarantors have submitted to the
jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may
be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and executive officers and
the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or security providers. In addition, as many of our
and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors and executive officers are located
outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in the
U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor or a security provider, investors will
need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the
enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in
which our Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent
jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**The Netherlands**

The following discussion with respect to enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in the Netherlands
is based upon advice provided to us by our Dutch counsel.

Most of the assets of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are located outside the United States and its
directors are non-residents of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in the
Netherlands against any of the persons listed above in an original action or in an action for the
enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts of civil liabilities predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws.

As there is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial
matters), a judgment rendered by a court in the United States will not be recognized and enforced by the
Dutch courts. However, if a person has obtained a final and conclusive judgment for the payment of
money rendered by a U.S. court which is enforceable in the United States (the ‘‘foreign judgment’’) and
files his claim with the competent Dutch court, the Dutch court will generally give binding effect to the
foreign judgment insofar as it finds that the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds
which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures have been observed and unless
the foreign judgment contravenes Dutch public policy.

To obtain an enforceable judgment against the Issuer and the Dutch subsidiaries in the Netherlands, the
matter will need to be re-litigated before the competent court in the Netherlands. In the course of such
proceedings, the U.S. judgment will have to be submitted to the relevant court in the Netherlands, and
the Dutch court may give the effect to the U.S. Judgment as it deems appropriate.

According to current practice, however, based upon case law, Dutch courts will be expected to render a
judgment in line with the U.S. Judgment, if and to the extent that:

- the court rendering the U.S. Judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation on
internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with general
principles of fair trial;

- the U.S. Judgment is final and definite; and

- such recognition is not in conflict with an existing Dutch judgment or with Dutch public policy (i.e., a
fundamental principle of Dutch law).

**England**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England is
based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisors. The United States and England
currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for

288


-----

payment rendered by any federal or state court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or
enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first
be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, an English court would
not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is
said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming
that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court
in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature,
or in respect of a penalty or fine;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter;
and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an
English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in
England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of Luxembourg (each a
‘‘Luxembourg Entity’’). The directors, officers and other executives of the Luxembourg Entities are
neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Luxembourg
Entities are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them
judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities
laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within Luxembourg upon those persons
or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that a contractual provision allowing the service of
process against any Luxembourg Entity to any other party appointed to such effect could be overridden
by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid service of process against any Luxembourg Entity
in accordance with applicable laws at its registered office. A valid judgment against a company
incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the Additional Notes obtained from a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may
be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered
and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg subject to compliance with the
enforcement procedures (exequatur) set forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau Code de
Procedure Civile, those being:

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under its
applicable laws, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local
law;

289


-----

- the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude a la loi);

- the judgment is final and duly enforceable in the jurisdiction where the decision is rendered
(executoire);

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws
rules;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the judgment was granted following proceedings where the defendant had the opportunity to
appear, and if appeared, to present a defense; and

- the consideration of the foreign order as well as the judgment does not contravene public policy as
understood under the laws of Luxembourg, nor has it been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax
nature.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if: (i) the choice of such law
was not made bona fide and (ii) its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not
have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought.

**Spain**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Spain is
based upon advice provided to us by our Spanish legal advisers.

A final and conclusive judgment duly rendered by certain U.S. courts or any other appellate court in the
United States would be enforceable in the competent courts of Spain, provided that prior to the time
such U.S. court judgment is introduced into a Spanish court for enforcement, there is no material
contradiction or incompatibility with a judgment rendered or judicial proceedings outstanding in Spain,
in accordance with Article 523.2 and the Derogation Provision of the current Civil Procedural Law and
subject to the former Civil Procedural Law of 1881, the substantive provisions of which are found in
Articles 951 to 958, both inclusive. Such provisions and the case law set forth that any final judgment
rendered outside Spain may be enforced in Spain in three different situations: (i) in the cases and in
accordance with the provisions of any applicable treaty; (ii) in the absence of any such treaty, in case it is
alleged and evidenced that the jurisdiction where the foreign judgment was given recognizes Spanish
judgments on a reciprocal basis when the requirements established in such foreign jurisdiction for the
recognition of Spanish judgments are complied with and provided that some minimal conditions are met
(inter alia, that the matter is not subject to Spanish exclusive jurisdiction for certain matters, does not
infringe public policy and is not in contradiction with a previous Spanish judgment); and (iii) in the
absence of an applicable treaty and when the positive reciprocity has not been evidenced, in those
cases in which the judgment given in the foreign jurisdiction complies with the requirements set forth in
article 954 of the Civil Procedural Law of 1881 which are that (a) the judgment has been rendered as a
result of an action ‘‘in personam’’ (as opposed to an action ‘‘in rem’’); (b) the defendant has been
properly served with the originating process; (c) the obligation to be enforced is legal under Spanish law;
(d) the documentation prepared for the purpose of requesting the enforcement meets all requirements
under the law of the United States in order to be considered an authentic judgment and it also meets all
requirements under the laws of Spain; and (e) it is not evidenced that a Spanish judgment would not be
recognized by and would not be enforceable in the relevant jurisdiction of the United States on a
reciprocal basis. Since there is no applicable treaty between Spain and the United States, unless the
conditions under (ii) above are met and, in accordance with certain court precedents, even if these
conditions are met, the conditions referred to in (iii) above will have to be satisfied in order to enforce a
judgment of a U.S. court in Spain.

**British Virgin Islands**

A judgment obtained in a U.S. court for either a liquidated sum or, in certain circumstances, for in
personam non-money relief, will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the British Virgin Islands at
common law without any re-examination of the merits, by an action commenced on the foreign
judgment debt in the courts of the British Virgin Islands, where the judgment is final and not subject to a
stay of execution.

290


-----

The BVI courts would enforce the relevant judgment, in the manner set out above, provided that:

- the judgment had not been wholly satisfied;

- such court had jurisdiction in the matter and the BVI company was duly served with process;

- the judgment given by such court was not in respect of penalties, taxes, fines or similar or revenue
obligations of the BVI company;

- in obtaining judgment there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was
given or on the part of the court;

- recognition or enforcement of the judgment in the British Virgin Islands would not be contrary to the
rules of public policy of the BVI courts; and

- the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were not contrary to natural justice.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1.** **General information**

TMF Group Holding B.V. (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘TMF Group’) is a leading global
provider of high value business services to clients operating and investing globally. TMF Group focuses
on providing highly specialized and business-critical financial, legal and human resource administrative
services that enable clients to operate their corporate structures, finance vehicles and investment funds
in different geographical locations. TMF Group has 116 offices located in 74 countries or 82 jurisdictions
across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East.

The Company was incorporated in the Netherlands on 3 August 2004. The address of the registered
office is Herikerbergweg 238, 1101 CM Amsterdam Zuidoost, the Netherlands. The Company principally
acts as a holding and finance company for group investments.

The shares in the Company are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V., which is 100% owned by TMF
Orange Holding B.V. 65% of the ordinary shares and all preference shares in TMF Orange Holding B.V.
are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson & Co V (which comprises a series of English limited partnerships
with each limited partnership having a common general partner in Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited) and
indirectly by the employees of affiliates of Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited. The remaining 35% of the
ordinary shares in TMF Orange Holding B.V. are indirectly held by the current and previous management
and employees of TMF Group.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue on 22 July 2014.
These financial statements have not been audited.

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended 31 March 2014
have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, ‘Interim financial reporting’. The condensed
consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
as adopted by the European Union.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the going
concern convention. As at 31 March 2014, TMF Group has negative equity. The result over the period
ended on 31 March 2014 is also negative. However cash generated from operations was positive. In
addition a major part of the financing is of a long-term nature. Therefore, and after making enquiries and
on the basis of the current cash flow projections and in combination with the available facilities, the
Board of Directors is confident that it has a reasonable expectation that TMF Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, it continues to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

**3.** **Accounting policies**

As from Q1 2014 lease car costs are reported as part of employee benefit expense instead of as part of
Sales, General and Administrative expenses. The Q1 2013 figures have been restated with e0.5 million.
All other accounting policies adopted are consistent with those in the previous financial year.

Taxes on income in the interim period are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to
expected total annual profit or loss.

There are no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the financial period beginning 1 January
2014 that have a material impact on TMF Group.

**4.** **Estimates**

The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**4.** **Estimates (Continued)**

In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements
made by management in applying TMF Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2013, except for the impairment review of intangible assets. A triggering event
analysis has been performed, which is based on the estimations for 2014 and beyond. No impairment
loss is expected.

**5.** **Financial risk management**

**Financial risk factors**

TMF Group’s operating activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management
information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements; they should be read in
conjunction with TMF Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2013. There have been no
changes in the risk management processes since year end or in any risk management policies.

**Liquidity risk**

Compared to year end, there is no material change in the contractual undiscounted cash outflows for
financial liabilities. Based on the rolling cash flow forecasts, TMF Group’s cash and liquidity
requirements can be met, whilst maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing
facilities (note 14).

**Capital risk management**

TMF Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard TMF Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders, benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. TMF Group’s loan and borrowings is
considered as the most important item from a capital management perspective.

TMF Group is highly leveraged and management focus is on cash generation and an important KPI used
in this respect is the cash conversion ratio, which is the percentage of EBITDA converted into cash. Cash
conversion is calculated as cash generated from operations divided by EBITDA. There is sufficient
headroom.

During 2013 and the three months ended 31 March 2014 TMF Group complied with its banking
covenants. Financial covenants based on financial ratios are only applicable for the revolving credit
facility and are expected to be achieved. The only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility
relates to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. There is sufficient headroom in place.

**Credit risk**

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions is managed centrally. For banks and financial institutions, TMF Group’s
policy is that only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘BBB’ are accepted. However, in
certain circumstances (e.g. due to local regulation) banks and financial institutions are used that are not
rated and / or that do not have a minimum ‘BBB’ rating. The use of these banks and financial institutions
is kept to the minimum level possible, closely monitored by TMF Group Treasury department and
periodically reported to the Board of Directors.

Credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, are
managed on a local basis. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for
each of their clients. Approval from management is mandatory before standard payment terms and
delivery terms and conditions are contractually agreed with new clients.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**5.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

TMF Group has significant concentrations of credit risk, being the loans receivable from related parties.
The maximum credit risk exposure of TMF Group’s financial assets at the end of the period is
represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.

**Fair value estimation**

There are three valuation methods to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The different levels
have been defined as follows:

- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs) (Level 3).

As at 31 March 2014, 31 December 2013 and 31 March 2013, the only financial instruments that are
accounted for to fair value are derivative financial instruments. The fair value of all derivative financial
instruments is based on the Level 2 method mentioned above.

No transfers between the different levels occurred and there were no changes in valuation techniques
during the period. No contingent consideration in business combination is applicable.

**Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values**

The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is based on the Level 2 method mentioned above.

The fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined
by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of
interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
observable yield curves.

**Group’s valuation processes**

The group’s finance department includes a team that performs the valuation of derivative financial
instruments. Changes in Level 2 fair values are analysed at each reporting date during the quarterly
closing.

**6.** **Seasonality of operations**

TMF Group has limited seasonality in its business. In the financial year 2013, 24.5% of revenue
accumulated in the first quarter of the year, with 75.5% accumulating in the last three quarters of the year.

The increase in the trade receivables compared to December 2013 stems from annual invoices that are
raised in advance, the liability as a result of the deferred part is reported within Trade and other payables.

**7.** **Segment information**

The Board of Directors is TMF Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the
operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors for the purpose of
allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board of Directors considers the business mainly
from a geographic perspective. However, a part of the business does not fall under one of the
geographic regions and is therefore disclosed separately.

TMF Group has operations in the following operating segments and locations:

— Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (‘Benelux’);

F-11

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**7.** **Segment information (Continued)**

— Europe, the Middle East and Africa, excluding Benelux (‘EMEA’);

— The countries of North and South America (‘Americas’);

— The countries of the Asia Pacific region (‘APAC’);

— Fund Services; and

— All other.

Although the segment Fund Services does not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for
reportable segments, management has concluded that this segment should be reported as it is closely
monitored by the Board of Directors similar to the other operating segments. The category ‘All other’
includes the operations of International Licensing and Collection (Freeway) and International Pensions
and the corporate revenue and expenses of TMF Group.

The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on both external revenue and
results from operations. This measurement basis excludes the effects of ‘Acquisition, litigation,
redundancy and restructuring costs’ and ‘depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges’. The
measure also excludes the effects of finance income and expenses since this type of activity is mainly
driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of TMF Group. Inter-segment
revenue comprises management fees and services provided to clients by other entities in TMF Group.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions
that would also be available to unrelated third parties.

The following tables present revenue and profit information regarding TMF Group’s operating segments
for the three months ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 respectively:

The operating segments Benelux, EMEA, Americas and APAC are mainly active in the Corporate,
Structured finance and Private client services. The operating segment Fund Services is only active in
Fund services.

No individual external client represents more than 10 percent of TMF Group’s external revenue.

**8.** **Business combinations**

**General**

Alongside TMF Group’s strategies for organic growth, it is TMF Group’s intention where appropriate to
continue to invest in acquisitions that provide additional scale to the business, a specific service line,
assist in consolidating fragmented markets or address relevant geographical gaps. TMF Group uses a
structured and disciplined approach for all acquisition evaluations.

With an effective date of 8 January 2014, TMF Group acquired the non-controlling interest in the Custom
House Group for an amount of e1 for the shares and a deferred consideration of maximum e20.7 million
(including interest) for which the amount depends on future performance of the Custom House Group.
The cash outflow in the first quarter of 2014 for this acquisition was e72 thousand and the existing loan
from the former non-controlling interest shareholders was replaced by a deferred consideration of
e16.0 million. No additional goodwill was created as a result of this acquisition. The acquisition of this
non-controlling interest had a negative effect on equity of e0.3 million.

With an effective date of 9 January 2014, TMF Group acquired the assets and liabilities of Tass Axia,
Indonesia, for a total consideration of e1.9 million, and merged this business into TMF Group. The cash
outflow in the first quarter of 2014 from this acquisition, net of cash acquired, was e1.3 million. The

deferred consideration for the business amounts to e0.6 million. No contingent liabilities were acquired
in this business combination.

In the first quarter of 2013 TMF did not invest in any acquisitions.

**Acquisition Tass Axia**

The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisition are as follows:

The intangible fixed assets are tax deductible.

The consideration deferred to future periods consists of an element that will be paid once the final
purchase price is agreed between the parties. This is expected to be paid in the next quarter. There is no
contingent consideration.

The impact on cash flows as a result of the acquisition is as follows:

The acquisition of Tass Axia positively impacted the revenue and result from operating activities before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges and acquisition, litigation, redundancy and restructuring
costs of the first quarter 2014 with an amount of respectively e130,000 and e59,000. Had the transaction
taken place at the beginning of the reporting period, these numbers would be approximately the same.

The acquisition costs amounted to e33,000 (note 10).

The acquisition, due diligence and start up costs in 2014 mainly relate to the acquisition of Tass Axia
(refer to note 8).

Litigation costs mainly include legal costs relating to legal claims. Legal claims are further disclosed in
note 18.

Redundancy and restructuring costs are mainly integration costs within the Fund Services operating
segment and termination fees for senior staff as a result of restructuring. In 2013, these costs mainly
relate to termination fees for senior staff.

**11. Income tax expense**

Income tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimation of the weighted average annual
income tax expected for the full financial year. The estimated average effective annual income tax rates
used for the year ending 31 December 2014 is (47)% (the estimated average effective annual income tax
rate for the three months ended 31 March 2013 was (24)%).

Most of the local operating companies reached a positive result before taxes. As these profits cannot be
off-set against the losses in the Dutch holding companies TMF Group pays taxes locally.

**Legal claims**

Below an update is shown in respect of the legal cases set out in the last annual financial statements:

**Case 1:**

Certain investors in property investment and development trusts and companies in respect of which
certain of our subsidiaries provided trustee, director and administration services in Jersey have
threatened legal proceedings and/or have filed complaints with the Jersey regulator against the relevant
TMF Group companies. Additionally, a claim was filed commencing proceedings in Jersey in December
2010 against two of TMF Group companies by the current trustee and manager of three collective
investment funds which invested in property development structures in respect of which our relevant
subsidiaries previously acted as trustee or manager. Subsequently in 2013, a substantial number of
investors independently commenced proceedings in England against three TMF Group companies—a
large amount of the damages claimed in the UK proceedings is in relation to the same claims made in
the Jersey proceedings. The legal proceedings and the claims filed in Jersey and England involve
investors claiming losses of substantial sums of money in connection with the underlying property
investments in Eastern Europe. The claims allege breach of trust, breach of contract, and breach of
fiduciary duty on the part of our relevant subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries’ activities in Jersey are
regulated. The Jersey regulator is at an advanced stage of an investigation in respect of aspects of
TMF’s Jersey business relating to this matter and is currently in the process of forming its decision on
any appropriate action that arises from the investigation conclusions. The regulator could choose to take
enforcement action which could result in an adverse public statement, commencement of legal
proceedings for a compensation order against TMF or other regulatory, and worst case outcomes might
include a material restriction or inability to conduct business in Jersey, or the need for TMF to commit
additional funding (or other form of support) to TMF’s Jersey companies. The Jersey regulator has also
commenced a related investigation into TMF’s Jersey companies.

**18. Contingencies (Continued)**

**Case 2:**

A TMF Group company acted as one of the directors of a Dutch holding company whose subsidiary
owned a Mexican property. Additional shares were issued by the subsidiary that resulted in the dilution
of the Dutch holding company’s (and its shareholders’) indirect interest in the Mexican property. Legal
proceedings were initiated in the Dutch Enterprise Chamber by one of the shareholders in the Dutch
holding company alleging mismanagement by all three of its directors (only one of whom, as noted
above, was a subsidiary of ours). The Dutch Enterprise Chamber found that there was mismanagement
on the part of all the directors. However, the Dutch Enterprise Chamber is not a forum to claim such
damages, and the relevant shareholder started civil proceedings in the Netherlands against our
subsidiary and the other directors to claim damages (which damages still need to be substantiated). The
plaintiff claimed funding for the civil claim by bringing a related preliminary proceeding in the
Netherlands, but this claim was denied by the Dutch courts (in first instance and on appeal).

**Case 3:**

A TMF Group company provided certain services in connection with a structured finance transaction,
whereby receivables from a bank were transferred to a special purpose vehicle (‘‘SPV’’) managed and
administered by TMF Group company. The SPV issued notes to investors. The note Trustee on behalf of
the note holders filed a claim in Luxembourg against TMF Group company in November 2012 asserting
that certain formalities were not complied with in relation to the transferring of underlying assets and
claiming that the SPV is at risk of material loss to the extent that it may be unable to repay the note
holders. These proceedings are in the process of being moved to LCIA arbitration in London with the
consent of the parties to the proceedings.

**Case 4:**

No significant development took place.

Two new cases have arisen:

**Case 5:**

A TMF Group company provided administrative services to a trust that is the issuer for a student loan
securitization program. The issuer issued notes to investors in order to acquire its receivables. Part of the
administrative services by the TMF Group company is the calculation of interest to be paid to the note
holders based on the transaction documentation. An incorrect rate has been used, which resulted in an
overpayment of interest to the note holders. The issuer has filed a demand letter to the TMF Group
company. No provision in relation to this claim has been recognised in these condensed interim financial
statements, as legal advice indicates that it is not probable that a significant liability will arise.

**Case 6:**

A TMF Group company acted as one of the directors (but not sole director) of an investment fund that
invested in life settlement policies and which it has been alleged has suffered certain losses. One of the
investors of this investment fund commenced court proceedings claiming that (among other things) the
TMF Group company, as director of the funds, should be held liable for these losses . It is unclear
whether any other investors will join in these court proceedings. No provision in relation to this claim has
been recognised in these condensed interim financial statements, as legal advice indicates that it is not
probable that a significant liability will arise.

TMF Group provided services to some personal structures of some key management personnel. The
related amounts charged to key management personnel are limited. TMF Group has not had any other
material transactions with key management and personnel.

**Other related party transactions**

The majority of the Dutch entities within the Group are part of a fiscal unity with TMF Group HoldCo B.V.
and TMF Group Holding B.V. As a consequence, those entities, TMF Group HoldCo B.V. and TMF Group
Holding B.V. are jointly and severally liable for corporate income tax of such a fiscal unity. In some other
countries, (some of the) entities form part of a fiscal unity and as a consequence those entities are jointly
and severally liable for corporate income tax of such a fiscal unity.

**20. Subsequent events**

On 30 April 2014, TMF Group sold its shares in Servicios Paralegalais e Contabeis Ltda (‘‘Serpac’’) for an
amount of e0.2 million.

On 12 July 2014, TMF Group acquired the assets and liabilities of KCS, an independent pan-Asian
corporate services provider specializing in corporate accounting, corporate secretarial and payroll
services. Purchase price allocation calculations did not yet take place.

TMF Group decided to issue on 22 July 2014 additional senior secured loan notes for an amount of
e45 million and senior loan notes for an amount of e20 million. A part of these additional loan notes is
used for the financing of the KCS acquisition.

In July 2014, TMF Group invited certain senior managers to participate in a Long Term Incentive
Programme (‘LTIP’). The LTIP is an equity based scheme that is based around existing shares held by
one of the management shareholding vehicles in TMF Orange Holding B.V., the shares being
contributed from Doughty Hanson and St Andrews Unit Trust. The details of the LTIP have not yet been
fully finalised.

**Independent auditor’s report**

To: the general meeting of TMF Group Holding B.V.

**Report on the financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2013 as set out on pages 32 to 111 of TMF
Group Holding B.V., Amsterdam, which comprise the consolidated and company balance sheet as at
31 December 2013, the consolidated and company income statement, the consolidated and company
statement of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the
notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

**Directors’ responsibility**

The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Directors’ review and
Financial review in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the directors
are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. This
requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

**Opinion[(1)]**

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of TMF Group
Holding B.V. as at 31 December 2013, and of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

Pursuant to the legal requirement under Section 2: 393 sub 5 at e and f of the Dutch Civil Code, we have
no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the Directors’ review and Financial
review, to the extent we can assess, have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of this
Code, and whether the information as required under Section 2: 392 sub 1 at b-h has been annexed.
Further we report that the Directors’ review and Financial review, to the extent we can assess, are
consistent with the financial statements as required by Section 2: 391 sub 4 of the Dutch Civil Code.

plans swiftly and flexibly by using its worldwide network of local offices and experts to assist on
administrative matters.

The Company was incorporated in the Netherlands on 3 August 2004. The address of the registered
office is at Herikerbergweg 238, 1101 CM Amsterdam Zuidoost, the Netherlands. The Company
principally acts as a holding and finance company for TMF Group investments.

The shares in the Company are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V., which is 100% owned by
TMF Orange Holding B.V. 65% of the ordinary shares and all preference shares in TMF Orange
Holding B.V. are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson & Co V (which comprises a series of English limited
partnerships with each limited partnership having a common general partner in Doughty Hanson & Co V
Limited) and indirectly by the employees of affiliates of Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited. The remaining
35% of the ordinary shares in TMF Orange Holding B.V. are indirectly held by the current and previous
management and employees of TMF Group.

TMF Orange Holding B.V. prepares also consolidated financial statements that are available to the
public.

These consolidated financial statements 2013 of TMF Group Holding B.V. were authorised for issue by
the Board of Directors on 27 March 2014. Until approval at the annual general shareholders meeting, the
Board of Directors can amend the financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements voluntary present three periods instead of two to comply with
the agreements made in this respect with the holders of the senior (secured) loan notes.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principle accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless stated
otherwise.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of TMF Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through income statement.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 3 (critical accounting estimates and judgements).

**Going concern**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern convention. As at
31 December 2013, TMF Group has negative equity. The results for the years ended on 31 December
2011, 2012 and 2013 were also negative. However, the cash generated from operations was positive in
these three years. In addition, a major part of the financing has a long-term nature. Therefore and after
making enquiries and on the basis of current cash flow projections in combination with the available
facilities, the Board of Directors is confident that it has a reasonable expectation that TMF Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, it
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Changes in accounting policies**

_New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2013_

Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’, regarding other comprehensive income. The
main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in
other comprehensive income (hereafter ‘OCI’) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable
to income statement subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not address
which items are presented in OCI. TMF Group adopted these amendments starting from January 2013.

IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was revised in June 2011. The changes on TMF Group’s accounting policies
has been as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and
expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate
to the net defined benefit liability (asset). TMF Group early adopted this amended IAS19 for the financial
year beginning 1 January 2012.

The amendments to IAS 28 (‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’) had no significant impact on
the Company financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’, on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial
assets. This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs (‘Cash
Generating Unit’) which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. The amendment is not
mandatory for the group until 1 January 2014, however TMF Group has decided to early adopt the
amendment as of 1 January 2013 and does not include the disclosure of the fair value less cost of
disposal for CGU’s with significant carrying amount of goodwill.

IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of
control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the
determination of control where this is difficult to assess. TMF Group adopted IFRS 10 starting from
January 2013. The first adoption of this new standard has no material effects on the financial statements.

IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’. Under IFRS 11 Investments in joint arrangements are classified either as
joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has
rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. TMF Group adopted IFRS 11 starting from
January 2013. The first adoption of this new standard has no material effects on the financial statements.

IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off
balance sheet vehicles.

IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a
precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure
requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and
US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be
applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS. The impact of
IFRS 13 will result in more extensive disclosures. TMF Group adopted IFRS 13 starting from January
2013.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year
beginning on or after 1 January 2013 that have a material impact to TMF Group.

_New standards and interpretations not yet adopted_

The following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been issued
but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013:

IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial
assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the

F-32

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires
financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39
requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial
liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
TMF Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. TMF Group will also consider the impact of the
remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the International Accounting Standards Board.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on TMF Group.

_Voluntary changes in accounting policies_

As from 2013, interest paid and interest received, as disclosed in the Cash Flow Statement, is reported
as part of the ‘Net cash generated from financing activities’ instead of as part of the ‘Net cash generated
from operating activities’. The reasoning for this change is that the interest paid and interest received is
for the greater part originating from financing activities and such it is more appropriate to classify these
cash flows as ‘Net cash generated from financing activities’, following the stipulations of IAS 7.31. This
change in accounting policy had respectively a positive and negative impact on the ‘Net cash generated
from operating activities’ and ‘Net cash generated from financing activities’ for an amount of
e39.4 million (2012) and e86.6 million (2011).

**2.2 Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The group
controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to TMF Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

TMF Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
considerations transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by TMF Group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, TMF Group recognises any controlling interest
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the
acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by TMF Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to
be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in income statement or as a change
to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured,
and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquire
and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquire over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of the consideration transferred,
non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised
directly in the income statement.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between TMF Group
companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are
recognised in assets are also eliminated. Amounts reported by subsidiaries are based on the policies
adopted by TMF Group.

**Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control**

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity
transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests
are also recorded in equity.

**2.3 Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of
Directors.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**

**Functional and presentation currency**

Items included in the financial statements of each of TMF Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (‘e’), which is the Company’s functional
and TMF Group’s presentation currency.

**Transactions and balances**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the Company using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement. Foreign
exchange gains and losses from transactions between TMF Group entities are recognized as OCI.

**TMF Group companies**

The results and financial position of all TMF Group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Euro are translated into
Euro as follows:

— assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;

— income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and

— all resulting exchange differences are recognized as OCI.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
operations and currency effects on loans receivable which are part of the net investment are taken to

F-34

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

OCI. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded
in equity are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Foreign exchange results on
goodwill are recognised in OCI.

**2.5 Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents
amounts receivable for services rendered. Revenue is stated net of discounts, returns, value added tax
and after eliminating sales within TMF Group. TMF Group recognizes revenue when the amount of
revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to
TMF Group. TMF Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of
client, transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.

**Service contracts**

TMF Group’s sole source of revenue is from the rendering of services. Revenue associated with
transactions shall be recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of
the reporting period.

TMF Group provides services to clients on a time and cost basis or based on a fixed price contract or a
combination of both. The exception to this is the fund services TMF Group provides where our fees are
based on the net asset value of funds under administration (subject to a minimum fee level) and services
where we receive fees per transaction, such as fees for incorporating special purpose vehicles.
TMF Group fixes the rates for its services locally based on local market conditions and local
management determinations of acceptable rates.

Revenue from time and cost contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as time has been spent
and/or direct expenses are incurred.

Revenue from fixed price contracts is generally recognized in the period in which the services are
provided, using a straight line basis over the term of the contract.

If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress
toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in
estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
give rise to the revision become known.

To the extent that any fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in
trade and other payables as deferred income.

**2.6 Other income and expenses**

Other income and expenses include those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of TMF Group’s financial performance. Transactions
which may give rise to Other income and expenses are principally gains and losses on disposal of
investments and subsidiaries, acquisition due diligence, start-up and integration related costs as well as
redundancy and restructuring costs.

**2.7 Leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

F-35

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

TMF Group leases certain equipment and software, where TMF Group has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership. These leases are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at
the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the
finance costs is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets acquired
under the financial lease is depreciated/ amortised over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the
lease term.

All leases that do not qualify as operational lease are classified as finance lease.

**2.8 Interest income**

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is
impaired, TMF Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future
cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the
discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognised using the
original effective interest rate.

**2.9 Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the
income statement except if it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized
in equity, or if it relates to items recognized directly in OCI, in which case it is recognized in OCI.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous
years.

Refer to note 2.23 on deferred income tax.

**2.10 Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of TMF Group’s share of
the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity or business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of entities or businesses is included in intangible assets.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is
made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The operating segments of TMF Group are
determined to be the level at which goodwill is allocated and tested for impairment, as monitoring for
internal management purposes does not take place on a lower level.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity or business include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity or business sold.

**Client lists**

Client lists, including client relationships, acquired by TMF Group have finite useful lives. Client lists are
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Separate
values are not attributed to internally generated client lists or relationships. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client lists over their estimated useful lives
(2-16 years). The residual values, the useful lives and the depreciation methods are reviewed
periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Non-compete agreements**

Non-compete agreements entered into by TMF Group have finite useful lives. Non-compete agreements
are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the non-compete
agreements over the period of their enforceability (1-5 years). The residual values, the useful lives and
the depreciation methods are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Brands**

Brands acquired by TMF Group have finite useful lives. Brands are initially measured at fair value and
subsequently measured at the costs less accumulated amortization. Brands are valued using the relief
from royalty method. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the
brand over the period of its estimated useful life (4-6 years). The residual values, the useful lives and the
depreciation methods are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Computer software**

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 3 years.
The residual values, the useful lives and the depreciation methods are reviewed periodically and
adjusted if appropriate.

**2.11 Property, plant and equipment**

**Recognition and measurement**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method to allocate
their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

— Buildings: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25-50 years
— Leasehold improvements: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . term of the lease
— Furniture and fittings: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
— Office and computer equipment: . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years
— Motor vehicles: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 years

The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance
sheet date.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (also refer to note 2.12).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Disposal**

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and
are recognized within other income/(expenses)—net, in the income statement.

**2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment or when there is an indication that the amount is not recoverable (e.g. goodwill). Assets
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use.

For goodwill impairment testing, refer to note 2.10. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**2.13 Financial assets**

**Classification**

TMF Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through income
statement, loans and receivables, and available for sale. The classification depends on the purpose for
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.

_(a)_ _Financial assets at fair value through income statement_

Financial assets at fair value through income statement are financial assets held for trading. A financial
asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this
category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are
classified as non-current.

_(b) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than
12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. TMF Group’s
loans and receivables comprise ‘non-current bank deposits’, ‘loans receivable from related parties’,
‘other loans receivable’, trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance
sheet.

_(c) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment
matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.

**Recognition and measurement**

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date—the date on which
TMF Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through income statement. Financial
assets carried at fair value through income statement are initially recognised at fair value, and
transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the
rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and TMF Group
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and

F-38


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

financial assets at fair value through income statement are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and
receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through income
statement’ category are presented in the income statement within ‘Other income/(expenses)—net’ in the
period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through income statement
is recognised in the income statement as part of other income when TMF Group’s right to receive
payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are
recognised in other comprehensive income. When securities classified as available for sale are sold or
impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income
statement as ‘Gains and losses from investment securities’. Interest on available-for-sale securities
calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement as part of other
income. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as
part of other income when TMF Group’s right to receive payments is established.

**2.14 Offsetting financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**2.15 Impairment of financial assets**

**Assets carried at amortised costs**

TMF Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a
financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result
of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss
event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing
significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that
they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that
there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or
economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The
carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As
a practical expedient, TMF Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value
using an observable market price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the
debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the
consolidated income statement.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Assets classified as available for sale**

TMF Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. For debt securities, TMF Group uses the criteria
referred to in the above paragraph. In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale, a
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the
assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative
loss—measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income statement—is removed from
equity and recognised in income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income
statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement. If, in a
subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the
increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in
income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.

**2.16 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the
item being hedged. TMF Group designates certain derivates as cash flow hedges of particular risks
associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.

TMF Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. TMF Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.

The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 25.
Movements on the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 23.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedge item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability
when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months. TMF Group has no trading derivatives.

**Cash flow hedge**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognized immediately in the income statement within ‘net finance costs’.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item affects income statement (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain
or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is
recognized in the income statement within net finance costs.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement within ‘net finance costs’.

**2.17 Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of

F-40


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that TMF Group will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of
the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the assets is
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement within ‘other operating expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written
off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited against ‘other operating expenses’ in the income statement. Trade receivables
include unbilled services which relate to services performed but not yet billed.

**2.18 Funds held under Trust**

Client money is held in TMF Group bank accounts on behalf of clients and is recorded separately as an
asset on the balance sheet of TMF Group. A corresponding liability is recognised within current liabilities
to reflect the linked character for TMF Group.

**2.19 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, bankoverdrafts, deposits held at call with banks and
other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

**2.20 Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**2.21 Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

**2.22 Loans and borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method.

Costs incurred during the (re)financing of loans and borrowings are capitalized and amortised over the
estimated useful lives of the loans and borrowings. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility
will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawn-down occurs. To the extent there is no
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee for the facility is
capitalised and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Loans and borrowings are
presented net of capitalized costs.

Loans and borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless TMF Group has an unconditional right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**2.23 Current and deferred income tax**

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where TMF Group operate and generate taxable

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an
asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable income statement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by TMF Group and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset
current tax receivables against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and
liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**2.24 Employee benefits**

**Pension obligations**

TMF Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world. The schemes are generally
funded through payments to insurance companies. TMF Group has both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which TMF Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity. TMF Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to
employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a
defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of
service and compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in Euro
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains or losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.

For defined contribution plans, TMF Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. TMF Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as an
employee benefit expense when they fall due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Other long-term employee benefits**

Some TMF Group companies provide jubilee or anniversary payments to their employees. The expected
costs of these benefits are accrued over the period until the benefit is earned using the same accounting
methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans, except that remeasurements are recorded in
the income statement. These obligations are valued annually.

Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as
the benefits are earned. An accrual is made at balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays
earned but not yet taken.

**2.25 Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when TMF Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as an interest expense.

**3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

TMF Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are outlined below.

**3.1 Cash flow projections**

TMF Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the
accounting policy stated in note 2.12. These calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on
financial budgets and five year forecasts approved by management. The annual EBITDA growth for the
first 5 years majorly impacts the cash flow projections and is based on past performance and
management’s expectations of market development. Cash flows beyond the five year period are
extrapolated using an estimated perpetual growth rate. Refer to note 14 for all key assumptions used for
the recoverable amount calculations.

These cash flow projections also support the going concern assumption.

**3.2 Impairment of trade receivables**

TMF Group periodically tests whether trade receivables, including unbilled services, have suffered any
impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.17. The calculation of the
allowance account for trade receivables requires the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with
the latest available information regarding the clients.

**3.3 Provisions**

The provisions of TMF Group mainly relate to legal cases and restructuring costs. Refer to note 2.25 for
the general accounting policies used and to note 26 and 31 for more details.

**3.4 Fair value estimation with respect to financial instruments**

There are three valuation methods to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The different levels
have been defined as follows:

— Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

— Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs) (Level 3).

As at 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011, the only financial instruments that are accounted for to fair
value are derivative financial instruments. The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is based on
the Level 2 method mentioned above.

The fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined
by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of
interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
observable yield curves.

TMF Group’s finance department includes a team that performs the valuation of derivative financial
instruments. Changes in Level 2 fair values are analysed at each reporting date during the quarterly
closing.

Refer to note 25 for further information on derivative financial instruments.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

**4.1 Financial risk factors**

TMF Group’s operating activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. TMF Group’s overall
financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on TMF Group’s financial performance.

Financial risk management is carried out by TMF Group’s central treasury department (TMF Group
Treasury) under policies approved by management. TMF Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and
hedges financial risks in close cooperation with TMF Group’s operating units. Management provides
written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivatives and non-derivative financial
instruments and investments of excess liquidity.

TMF Group’s treasury risk management policy is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so,
fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates
and the currency exposure of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.

**4.2 Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that unexpected interest rate changes negatively affect TMF Group’s results,
cash flows and equity.

It is TMF Group’s policy to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility on its results, cash flows and
balance sheet within certain boundaries. Although TMF Group has some interest-bearing assets (cash
and cash equivalents and loans and borrowings provided to related parties), TMF Group’s income and
operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.

F-44

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

TMF Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates
expose TMF Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose TMF Group to
fair value interest rate risk.

TMF Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a periodic basis. Based on this analysis and in close
cooperation with the banks, TMF Group determines whether derivative financial instruments should be
in place to limit the interest rate risk in such a way that it has a mininum potential adverse effect on the
financial performance of TMF Group. For the derivative financial instruments in place, reference is made
to note 25.

At 31 December 2013, if market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other
variables held constant, then this would have the following impact:

**In million of Euro** **2013** **2012** **2011**

Result for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.5/(5.6) (4.1)/4.1 (5.4)/5.4
Other comprehensive income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.7/(1.5) 12.1/(12.2) 10.8/(11.1)
Fair value of derivative financial instruments . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.8/(6.7) 12.1/(12.2) 10.8/(11.1)

**4.3 Foreign currency exchange risk**

TMF Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and related currencies. In several markets
client contracts are denominated in Euro or US Dollars although this is not the functional currency in
these markets.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and
investments in foreign operations. Currently, no hedging of foreign exchange risk takes places.

TMF Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of TMF Group’s foreign
operations is managed primarily through both borrowings to subsidiaries and external borrowings to
TMF Group denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. As a result, for most major currencies the
foreign currency exposure is minimal. As such, TMF Group does not apply for net investment hedge
accounting in its financial statements.

As at 31 December 2013, if Euro had strengthened/weakened by 5% against the US Dollar with all
variables held constant, the result for the year would have been e2.1 million lower/higher, mainly due to
operating results in USD. As at 31 December 2012, the loss for the year would have been e3.2 million
lower/higher and as at 31 December 2011 e3.0 million higher/lower.

**4.4 Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that counterparties fail to meet their contractual payment obligations through
insolvency or default as well as credit exposure to clients.

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions is managed centrally. For banks and financial institutions, TMF Group’s
policy is that only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘BBB’ are accepted. However, in
certain circumstances (e.g. due to local regislation) banks and financial institutions are used that are not
rated and / or that do not have a minimum ‘BBB’ rating. The use of these banks and financial institutions
is kept to the minimum level possible, closely monitored by TMF Group Treasury department and
periodically reported to the Board of Directors.

Credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, are
managed on a local basis. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for
each of their clients. Approval from management is mandatory before standard payment terms and
delivery terms and conditions are contractually agreed with new clients.

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

TMF Group has significant concentrations of credit risk, being the loans receivable from related parties.
The maximum credit risk exposure of TMF Group’s financial assets at the end of the period is
represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.

**4.5 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that TMF Group does not have sufficient headroom (cash and cash equivalents
plus committed credit lines) available to meet both TMF Group’s day-to-day operating requirements and
debt servicing obligations (interest and debt repayment).

TMF Group Treasury mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring TMF Group maintains sufficient cash and
marketable securities, the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities
and the ability to close out market positions.

Cash flow forecasting is performed by management of the operating entities of TMF Group which is
consolidated by TMF Group Finance department. These rolling forecasts are monitored to ensure TMF
Group’s cash and liquidity requirements are sufficient to meet operational needs whilst maintaining
sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 24). This enables management
to monitor compliance with borrowing limits and debt covenants on its borrowing facilities.

The table below analyses TMF Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
period remaining to contractual maturity date. The cash flows with respect to operating lease
commitments are shown in note 30. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows and thus excluding capitalized finance costs. Balances due within 12 months
are equal to their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

TMF Group has a revolving credit facility totalling e70.0 million as at 31 December 2013. This facility
consists of a e51.0 million facility for cash needs (fully undrawn) and a e19.0 million facility for bank
guarantees (of which e4.8 million is undrawn). As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the
undrawn borrowing facilities amounted to e53.7 million respectively e103.7 million.

**4.6 Capital risk management**

TMF Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard TMF Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders, benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. TMF Group’s loan and borrowings is
considered as the most important item from capital management perspecitive.

TMF Group is highly leveraged and management focus is on cash generation and an important KPI used
in this respect is the cash conversion ratio, which is the percentage of EBITDA converted into cash. Cash
conversion is calculated as Cash generated from operations divided by EBITDA.

The following table sets out a breakdown of the cash flow for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013.

TMF Group treasury monitors cash balances on a daily basis. Appropriate action is taken to optimize
interest costs while at the same time safeguarding sufficient liquidity. In order to further increase the
efficient management of TMF Group’s interest costs and Revolving Credit facility drawings, TMF Group
has implemented a global cash management system and will continue to enhance cash management
operations during 2014. This focus should make it possible for TMF Group to pay interest and repay the
loans as they fall due.

During 2011, 2012 and 2013 TMF Group complied with its banking covenants. Following the refinancing
of the senior bank debt with Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes in December 2012, financial
covenants based on financial ratios are only applicable for the revolving credit facility and are expected
to be achieved. The only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility relates to the ratio of Net
Debt to EBITDA. There is sufficient headroom.

**5.** **Segment information**

The Board of Directors is TMF Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the
operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors for the purpose of
allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board of Directors considers the business mainly
from a geographic perspective. However, a part of the business does not fall under one of the
geographic regions and is therefore disclosed separately.

TMF Group has operations in the following operating segments and locations:

— Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (‘Benelux’);

— Europe, the Middle East and Africa, excluding Benelux (‘EMEA’);

— The countries of North and South America (‘Americas’);

— The countries of the Asia Pacific region (‘APAC’);

— Fund Services; and

— All other.

Although the segment Fund Services does not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for
reportable segments, management has concluded that this segment should be reported as it is closely
monitored by the Board of Directors similar to the other operating segments. The category ‘All other’
includes the operations of International Licensing and Collection (Freeway) and International Pensions
(Panthera) and the corporate expenses of TMF Group.

The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on both external revenue and
results from operations. This measurement basis excludes the effects of ‘other income / expenses’ and
‘depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges’. The measure also excludes the effects of finance
income and expenses since this type of activity is mainly driven by the central treasury function, which
manages the cash position of TMF Group. Inter-segment revenue comprises management fees and
services provided to clients by other entities in TMF Group. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are
entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated
third parties.

**6.** **Business combinations**

**General**

Alongside TMF Group’s strategies for organic growth, it is the group’s intention where appropriate to
continue to invest in acquisitions that provide additional scale to the business, a specific service line,
assist in consolidating fragmented markets or address relevant geographical gaps. TMF Group uses a
disciplined approach for all acquisition evaluations.

With an effective date of 29 November 2013, TMF Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Accepta
AS, Norway, for a total consideration of e9.7 million, and merged this business into TMF Group. The cash
outflow in 2013 from this acquisition, net of cash acquired, was e4.2 million. The deferred consideration
for this business combination amounts to e5.0 million of which e1.1 million is a contingent consideration.
No contingent liabilities were acquired in this business combination.

Except for the acquisition of four non-significant non-controlling interests in current TMF Group
companies, TMF Group did not invest in any acquisition during 2012. The acquisition of these
non-controlling interests had a negative effect on equity of e0.6 million.

With an effective date of 1 January 2011, TMF Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Equity
Trust (Equity Trust Holding S.`ar.l, Luxembourg), for a total consideration of e215.1 million, and merged
this business into TMF Group. The cash outflow from this acquisition, net of cash acquired, was
e172.2 million. The deferred consideration for this business combinations amounted to nil. No
contingent liabilities were acquired in this business combination.

The consideration deferred to future periods consists of:

— a part that will be paid once the final purchase price is agreed between parties;

— a part that will be paid once the statutory annual accounts of Accepta of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are
finalised; and

— a part that will be paid if certain growth targets are met in the period 2014 to 2016.

The acquisition of Accepta positively impacted the revenue and result from operating activities before
depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges and other income/expenses of 2013 with an amount of
respectively e568,000 and e22,000.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2013, this acquisition would have contributed e6.4 million to
revenue and e1.4 million to the result from operating activities before depreciation, amortisation,
impairment charges and other income/expenses in addition to the amounts disclosed in the previous
paragraph. Consequently, TMF Group revenue would have been e403.2 million and the result from
operating activities before depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges and other income/expenses
would have been e110.3 million.

The acquisition costs amounted to e0.1 million.

operating activities before depreciation, amortisation, impairment charges and other income/expenses
of 2011.

The acquisition, due diligence and start up costs in 2013 mainly relate to additional acquisition costs with
respect to the merger with Equity Trust (accrual for possible non-deductible VAT on acquisition costs)
and to the acquisition of Accepta AS (refer to note 6). In 2012, these costs relate to an increase in
deferred consideration. In 2011, these costs mainly relate to costs incurred as result from the merger
with Equity Trust.

Litigation costs mainly include legal costs relating to legal claims. Legal claims are further disclosed in
note 31.

Redundancy and restructuring costs in 2013 mainly concerns integration costs within the Fund Services
operating segment and termination fees for some senior staff. In 2012 and 2011, these costs mainly
relate to integration costs as result of the merger with Equity Trust. These costs include items such as
staff redundancies, premises (e.g. onerous lease contracts), IT and professional fees.

The impairment loss on financial assets available-for-sale originates from investments in other entities,
available for sale. The loss reported is the variance between the carrying value of these investments and
the anticipated sales price.

**13. Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result attributable to owners of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares
purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.

Basic earnings per share is calculated as follows:

**Basic earnings per share (in Euro) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(1,696)** **(2,272)** **(4,042)**

Since the Company has no convertible debt or share options, the diluted earnings per share equals the
basic earnings per share.

The carrying value of client lists as at 31 December 2013 primarily relates to the acquisition of Equity
Trust. The Equity Trust brand is no longer in use and as such fully amortised in 2013. The remaining
brand value relates to the Lord Securities brand in the United States.

For the years ended 31 December 2013, 2012 and 2011, the impact of the disposals on the income
statement was limited. Refer to note 10.

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The operating segments of TMF Group are determined to be the level at which goodwill is allocated and
tested for impairment, as monitoring for internal management purposes does not take place on a lower
level. The allocation of goodwill is made to those CGU’s or groups of CGU’s that are expected to benefit
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the fair value less cost of disposal. These
calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on 2014 financial budgets and the five year
forecasts approved by management. The annual EBITDA growth for the first 5 years is considered to be
a key assumption and is based on past performance and management’s expectations of market

**22. Equity**

**Share capital and share premium**

At 31 December 2011, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013, the authorized share capital
comprised 90,000 shares divided into 90,000 ordinary shares. The issued share capital amounts to
e18,000 and consists of 18,000 ordinary shares with a nominal value of e1 each. All shares are fully paid.
All shares have similar rights in meetings of the shareholders.

In 2012 without issuing of shares, capital contributions from the parent company for an amount of
e7.8 million (2011: e81.7 million) were added to the share premium reserve. No cash is received in this
respect.

TMF Group HoldCo B.V. provided the Group with capital contributions amounting to e65.9 million during
2010. The legal form of these contributions was an interest-free related party loan, which was converted
during 2012.

**Retained earnings**

At 31 December 2011, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 legal reserves of respectively
e3.5 million, e3.8 million and e8.0 million are included in retained earnings. Legal reserves are
mandatory statutory reserves held by TMF Group subsidiaries. These reserves and the currency
translation reserves are not available for distribution to shareholders.

- these borrowings were repaid on 7 December 2012

The fair values disclosed above are based on Level 2 fair value calculations.

The fair value of the senior secured and senior loan notes is based on the average of the trading price
stated by Bloomberg contributors. The average trading price per 31 December 2013 was at 102.335% of
the book value for the senior secured loan notes and 108.683% for the senior loan notes.

The fair value of the intercompany loans equals the carrying amount in case loans had been recently
priced. Where this is not the case an appropriate Bloomberg interest curve was used to determine the
fair value. Refer to note 32 for further information on related party loans.

The senior loan notes and revolving credit facility are secured over certain shares, bank accounts, trade
receivables and intercompany receivables of several entities within TMF Group.

It is contractually agreed that the interest on the unsecured related party loans is rolled-up.

For the calculation of the amortised cost price of the senior secured loan notes, it is assumed in the
prediction of future cash flows that future interest rates on these loan notes are comparable with the
variable interest rate in 2012. The effective interest rate of the senior loan notes and bank loans is 0.98%
for 2013, 1.27% for 2012 and 1.80% for 2011 higher than the nominal interest rate due to capitalised
finance costs.

**26. Provisions (Continued)**

**Restructuring**

The restructuring provisions have been created to cover the Equity Trust integration costs, mainly in the
Netherlands. Integration costs include staff redundancies and onerous office lease agreements. A
substantial part of the restructuring provisions will be used in 2014. The remainder will be used in the
period up to 2018.

**Loss making contracts**

The provision for loss making client contracts in Jersey and Hong Kong covers unavoidable future
losses as a result of these contracts. The provision is fully used as at 31 December 2013.

**Employee benefits**

The provision for employee benefits mainly relates to jubilee and anniversary benefit schemes of which
the initial recognition took place in 2013 in the applicable countries. The short term part of the provision
amounts to e0.1 million.

**27. Retirement benefit obligations**

TMF Group operates four average salary pension schemes in the Netherlands, for its employees with a
retirement age of 65 years and an entry age between 18 years and 25 years. The pension schemes are
career average plans with for a part of the employees conditional indexation of accrued benefits and for
a part of the employees unconditional indexation of accrued benefits. The scheme is an insurance
scheme whereby the insurer will pay future annuities for which it receives annual premiums from the
employing company and (a part of) the employees. The insurance company falls under the supervision
of the Dutch National Bank. The insurance company guarantees the accrued nominal benefits and as
such essentially removes the downside risks to TMF Group. The pension schemes qualify as defined
benefit schemes.

The funding agreement with the insurer describes that the insurer can charge TMF Group for costs that
cover the following purposes:

- Coming service benefits;

- Risk premiums for death benefits and disability benefits;

- Past service benefit increases due to (full) indexation of past service benefits to actives (for 1 of the
pension schemes);

- Guarantee premiums, cost for the administration of the benefits, and the management cost of the
assets; and

- Risk buffers.

TMF is not obliged to pay for:

- Past service benefit increases due to wage increases;

- Past service benefit increases due to (full) indexation of past service benefits to actives (for 1 of the
pension schemes);

- Past service benefit increases due to (full) indexation of past service benefits to inactives;

- Catch up contributions (e.g. for a transitory plan); and

- Asset management fees, past service related administration cost.

**27. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

Means that are available or will become available in the contract will, up to a maximum, be allocated to
the current and former employees through benefit increases. Only after the maximum has been reached
means will be allocated to TMF Group. Any surpluses in the plan are not fully recoverable by TMF Group.

The assets in the scheme partly represent the market value of the funded benefits at the insurer, the
(expected) interest profit sharing and the current account with the insurer, and partly represent the
market value of investments in bonds. The liabilities in the scheme represent the present value of the
current and future defined benefit pension obligations. Only in certain specific circumstances there is a
legal obligation on TMF Group subsidiaries to fund any reported deficit in these schemes.

For one of the pension schemes a plan amendment took place, effective as from 1 January 2014. The
past service costs are separately disclosed on the next pages. The changes for this scheme are:

- Accrual rate increases from 1.79% to 1.84%.

- The retirement age for benefits accrued increases from 62 to 65.

All retirement benefit obligations are of a long term nature. The amounts in the balance sheet were
determined as follows and are based on external actuarial reports.

The actuarial loss in 2013 is due to differences between the interest income and actual return on assets.

The actual return on plan assets for the years ended 31 December 2011, 2012 and 2013 is respectively
e0.1 million, e9.0 million and e0.4 million. The assets in the plans comprise qualifying insurance policies
with a profit sharing arrangement. The value of the profit sharing arrangement is based on the profit
sharing provisions in the contracts with the insurance company. All assets can be considered as ‘not
quoted in an active market’.

For setting the discount rate the actuary used a basket of euro denominated bonds that are rated ‘‘AA’’
by Merrill Lynch. For durations up to approximately 12 years, this basket of bonds provides usable yield
information. For durations over approximately 12 years the yield curve is extended, using ECB statistics
on AAA-rated euro area central government bonds. Corporate bonds with a significant bid-ask spread
are excluded. Based on this yield curve, and based on the estimated cash flows in the TMF plan, an
effective discount rate for all liabilities in the plan is determined.

**Fiscal unity**

The majority of the Dutch entities within TMF Group are part of a fiscal unity with TMF Group HoldCo B.V.
As a consequence, those entities and TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are jointly and severally liable for
corporate income tax liabilities of the fiscal unity.

**31. Contingencies**

**Legal claims**

TMF Group has contingent liabilities in respect to legal claims. The most material claims are described
below:

**Case 1**

Certain TMF Group companies provided trustee, director and administration services in property
investment and development trusts and associated companies. Certain investors in respect of these
investments have threatened legal proceedings and/or have filed complaints with the Jersey regulator
against these TMF Group companies. Additionally, a claim was filed commencing proceedings in Jersey
in December 2010 against two TMF Group companies by the current trustee and manager of three
collective investment funds which invested in property development structures in respect of which the
relevant TMF Group companies previously acted as trustee or manager. Subsequently in 2013, some of
the investors commenced independent and conflicting proceedings in England against three TMF
Group companies. A majority of the claims pursued in the English proceedings pursue the same claims
made in the Jersey proceedings. Both the Jersey and English legal proceedings involve investors
claiming losses of substantial sums of money in connection with the underlying property investments in
Eastern Europe. Certain of TMF Group companies’ activities in Jersey are regulated and the Jersey
regulator is currently investigating some of TMF Group companies’ actions relating to investments,
including the handling of the investor complaints referred to above.

**Case 2**

A TMF Group company acted as one of three directors of a Dutch holding company whose subsidiary
owned a foreign property. Additional shares were issued by the subsidiary that resulted in the dilution of
the Dutch holding company’s (and its shareholders) indirect interest in the overseas property. Legal
proceedings were initiated with the Dutch Enterprise Chamber by one of the shareholders in the Dutch
holding company alleging mismanagement by all three of its directors (only one of whom, as noted
above, was a TMF Group company). The Dutch Enterprise Chamber determined in favour of the
shareholder. The appeal of TMF Group company and the other directors was not accepted by the court
and TMF Group company is appealing this decision. The respective shareholder started civil

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31. Contingencies (Continued)**

proceedings against TMF Group company and the other directors to claim damages. TMF Group
company intends to vigorously defend the civil proceedings.

**Case 3**

A TMF Group company provided certain services in connection with a structured finance transaction,
whereby receivables from a bank were transferred to a special purpose vehicle (‘‘SPV’’) managed and
administered by TMF Group company. The SPV issued notes to investors. The note Trustee on behalf of
the note holders filed a claim in Luxembourg against TMF Group company in November 2012 asserting
that certain formalities were not complied with in relation to the transferring of underlying assets and
claiming that the SPV is at risk of material loss to the extent that it may be unable to repay the note
holders.

**Case 4**

The liquidators of an English company, of which during a prior period a certain TMF Group company had
provided directors and administration services in Jersey, in February 2013 served legal proceedings
against its former directors and TMF Group company. The primary assets of the English company
consisted of substantial London property. The legal proceedings involve allegations of sale of the
London property to a related entity at an undervalue, recovery of an associated loan and income
generated by the London property.

While TMF Group cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing matters, based upon information
currently available to TMF Group and in light of TMF Group’s insurance coverage management does not
believe that the final outcome of these proceedings and any threatened proceedings will have a material
adverse effect on TMF Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

TMF Group has contingent liabilities in respect to other legal claims arising from the normal course of
business. It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities other than
those provided for.

**Contingent assets**

During 2008 TMF Group sold and assigned e9.3 million of certain financial assets and deferred tax
assets to Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. which is entitled to return of 10% of the
purchase price or the unrecovered portion thereof each year (‘Yield’). This Yield will be calculated up to
the date that Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. has been able to unconditionally transfer all
assets to a third party or otherwise realized in cash. If the aggregated proceeds received by Middenberm
Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. for all assets are in excess of the purchase price, increased by the
Yield, then the amount of excess shall be considered as an adjustment to the purchase price and repaid
to TMF Group.

**32. Related party transactions**

**Ultimate controlling party**

The shares in the Company are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V., which is 100% owned by TMF
Orange Holding B.V. 65% of the ordinary shares and all preference shares in TMF Orange Holding B.V.
are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson & Co V (which comprises a series of English limited partnerships
with each limited partnership having a common general partner in Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited) and
indirectly by the employees of affiliates of Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited. The remaining 35% of the
ordinary shares in TMF Orange Holding B.V. are indirectly held by the current and previous management
and employees of TMF Group.

In 2013, 2012 and 2011, TMF Group provided services to Doughty Hanson & Co and its associated

material transactions with key management and personnel.

**Other related party transactions**

The majority of the Dutch entities within TMF Group are part of a fiscal unity with TMF Group HoldCo B.V.
As a consequence, those entities and TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are jointly and severally liable for
corporate income tax liabilities of the fiscal unity. In some other countries, (some of the) entities form part
of a fiscal unity and as a consequence those entities are jointly and severally liable for corporate income
tax of such a fiscal unity.

**Independent auditor’s report**

To: the general meeting of TMF Group Holding B.V.

**Report on the financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2012 as set out on pages 23 to 91 of TMF
Group Holding B.V., Amsterdam, which comprise the consolidated and company balance sheet as at
31 December 2012, the consolidated and company income statement, the consolidated and company
statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the
notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

**Directors’ responsibility**

The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Directors’ review and
Financial review in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the directors
are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. This
requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

**Opinion[(1)]**

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of TMF Group
Holding B.V. as at 31 December 2012, and of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

Pursuant to the legal requirement under Section 2: 393 sub 5 at e and f of the Dutch Civil Code, we have
no deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the Directors’ review and Financial
review, to the extent we can assess, has been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of this Code,
and whether the information as required under Section 2: 392 sub 1 at b-h has been annexed. Further we
report that the Directors’ review and Financial review, to the extent we can assess, is consistent with the
financial statements as required by Section 2: 391 sub 4 of the Dutch Civil Code.

plans swiftly and flexibly by using its worldwide network of local offices and experts to assist on
administrative matters.

The Company was incorporated in the Netherlands on 3 August 2004. The address of the registered
office is at Herikerbergweg 238, 1101 CM Amsterdam Zuidoost, the Netherlands. The Company
principally acts as a holding and finance company for group investments.

The shares in the Company are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V. 65% of the ordinary shares and all
preference shares in TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson & Co V (which
comprises a series of English limited partnerships with each limited partnership having a common
general partner in Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited) and indirectly by the employees of affiliates of
Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited. The remaining 35% of the ordinary shares in TMF Group HoldCo B.V.
are indirectly held by the existing and previous management and employees of the Group.

TMF Group HoldCo B.V. prepares also consolidated financial statements that are available to the public.

These consolidated financial statements 2012 of TMF Group Holding B.V. were authorised for issue by
the Board of Directors on 21 March 2013. Until approval at the annual general shareholders meeting, the
Board of Directors can amend the financial statements.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principle accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless stated
otherwise.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through income statement.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 3 (critical accounting estimates and judgements).

**Going concern**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern convention. As at
31 December 2012, the Group has a negative equity. The results for the years ended on 31 December
2010, 2011 and 2012 were also negative. However, the cash generated from operations was positive in
these three years. In addition, a major part of the financing has a long-term nature. Therefore and after
making enquiries and on the basis of current cash flow projections in combination with the available
facilities, the Board of Directors is confident that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**Changes in accounting policies**

_New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2012_

IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. The Group decided to early adopt this
amended IAS19 for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012. The impact of the adoption on the
Group’s financial statements is as follows:

— Due to elimination of the corridor approach, the recognition of all actuarial gains and losses in other
comprehensive income and a change of estimate regarding the plan assets, the retirement benefit
obligation as at 1 January 2012 increased (and retained earnings decreased) with e0.2 million.

— Figures of 2011 and 2010 are restated for comparison purposes. As a consequence, the losses for
the years 2011 and 2010 are respectively e1.4 million and e0.5 million lower compared to the
original 2011 and 2010 financial statements. Other comprehensive income for the years 2011 and
2010 is respectively e0.4 million and e0.9 million lower.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year
beginning on or after 1 January 2012 that have a material impact to the Group.

_New standards and interpretations not yet adopted_

The following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been issued
but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012.

Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’, regarding other comprehensive income. The
main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in
other comprehensive income (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or
loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not address which items are
presented in OCI.

IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of
control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the
determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The impact of IFRS 10 is considered limited for
the Group. The Group intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after
1 January 2014.

IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other
off balance sheet vehicles. The impact of IFRS 12 is considered limited for the Group. The Group intends
to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a
precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure
requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and
US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be
applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The
impact of IFRS 13 will result in more extensive disclosures. The Group will adopt IFRS 13 no later than
the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the Group.

_Restatements_

During the year it was established that the remuneration on the loans between two subsidiaries of TMF
Group Holding B.V. and TMF Group HoldCo B.V., which are presented under the Financial Assets was

not accrued since 1 January 2010. This adjustment has an impact on the Finance Income in the Income
Statement for an amount of respectively e5.3 million and e5.7 million for 2010 and 2011.

**2.2 Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when
assessing whether the Group controls a specific entity. The Group also assesses existence of control
where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power but is able to govern the financial and
operating policies by virtue of de-facto control. De-facto control may arise in circumstances where the
size of the Group’s voting power rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings or other
shareholders give the Group the power to govern the financial and operating policies, etc.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
considerations transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any controlling interest in
the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset
or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in income statement or as a change to other
comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair
value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The full
goodwill method is applied for non-controlling interests.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group
companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are
recognised in assets are also eliminated. Amounts reported by subsidiaries are based on the policies
adopted by the Group.

**Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control**

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity
transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests
are also recorded in equity.

**2.3 Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating

resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of
Directors makes the Group’s strategic decisions.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**

**Functional and presentation currency**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (‘e’), which is the Company’s functional
and the Group’s presentation currency.

**Transactions and balances**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the Company using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement.

**Group companies**

The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Euro are translated into
Euro as follows:

(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;

(b) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and

(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognized as OCI.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
operations and of borrowings are taken to OCI. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold,
exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognized in the income statement as part of the
gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Foreign exchange results on
goodwill are recognised in OCI.

**2.5 Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents
amounts receivable for services rendered. Revenue is stated net of discounts, returns, value added tax
and after eliminating sales within the Group. The Group recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue
can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The
Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of client, transaction
and the specifics of each arrangement.

**Service contracts**

The Group’s sole source of revenue is from the rendering of services. The Group provides services to
clients on a time and cost basis or based on a fixed price contract or a combination of both. The revenue
is generally derived from client engagements based on an annual fee for agreed services plus an hourly
rate for additional work undertaken. The exception to this is the fund services the Group provides where

F-101


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

our fees are based on the net asset value of funds under administration (subject to a minimum fee level)
and services where we receive fees per transaction, such as fees for incorporating special purpose
vehicles. The Group fixes the rates for its services locally based on local market conditions and local
management determinations of acceptable rates. The annual fee element is a fixed fee which is often
paid upfront resulting in a limited history of fee arrears.

Revenue from time and cost contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as time has been spent
and/or direct expenses are incurred.

Revenue from fixed price contracts is generally recognized in the period in which the services are
provided, using a straight line basis over the term of the contract.

If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress
toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in
estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
give rise to the revision become known.

To the extent that any fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in
trade and other payables as deferred income.

**2.6 Other income and expenses**

Other income and expenses include those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions
which may give rise to Other income and expenses are principally gains and losses on disposal of
investments and subsidiaries, acquisition due diligence, start-up and integration related costs as well as
redundancy and restructuring costs.

**2.7 Leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group leases certain equipment and software, where the Group has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership. These leases are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at
the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the
finance costs is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets acquired
under the financial lease is depreciated/ amortised over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the
lease term.

All leases that do not qualify as operational lease are classified as finance lease.

**2.8 Interest income**

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is
impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future
cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the
discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognised using the
original effective interest rate.

**2.9 Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the
income statement except if it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized
in equity, or if it relates to items recognized directly in OCI, in which case it is recognized in OCI.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous
years.

Refer to note 2.21 on deferred income tax.

**2.10 Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired entity or business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of entities or businesses is included in intangible assets.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is
made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The operating segments of the Group are
determined to be the level at which goodwill is allocated and tested for impairment, as monitoring for
internal management purposes does not take place on a lower level.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity or business include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity or business sold.

**Client lists**

Client lists, including client relationships, acquired by the Group have finite useful lives. Client lists are
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Separate
values are not attributed to internally generated client lists or relationships. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client lists over their estimated useful lives
(2-16 years). The useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Non-compete agreements**

Non-compete agreements entered into by the Group have finite useful lives. Non-compete agreements
are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line
method to allocate the cost of the non-compete agreements over the period of their enforceability
(1-5 years). The useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Brands**

Brands acquired by the Group have finite useful lives. Brands are initially measured at fair value and
subsequently measured at the costs less accumulated amortization. Brands are valued using the relief
from royalty method. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line

method to allocate the cost of the brand over the period of its estimated useful life (4-20 years). The
useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Computer software**

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of 3 years.
The useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate.

**2.11 Property, plant and equipment**

**Recognition and measurement**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method to allocate
their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

— Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25-50 years

— Leasehold improvements . . . . . term of the lease

— Furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . 10 years

— Office and computer equipment 3-5 years

— Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 years

The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance
sheet date.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (also refer to note 2.12).

**Disposal**

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and
are recognized within other income/(expenses)—net, in the income statement.

**2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment or when there is an indication that the amount is not recoverable (e.g. goodwill). Assets
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units, ‘CGU’s’). For goodwill impairment testing,
refer to note 2.10. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**2.13 Financial assets**

The Group classifies all its financial assets as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are
non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the
balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables

F-104


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

comprise ‘non-current bank deposits’, ‘loans receivable from related parties’ and other ‘loans and
receivables’.

**2.14 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the
item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivates as cash flow hedges of particular risks
associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.

The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.

The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 24.
Movements on the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 22.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedge item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability
when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months. The Group has no trading derivatives.

**Cash flow hedge**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognized immediately in the income statement within ‘net finance costs’.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to income statement in the periods when the hedged
item affects income statement (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain
or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is
recognized in the income statement within net finance costs.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement within ‘net finance costs’.

**2.15 Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of
trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of
the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the assets is
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement within ‘other operating expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written
off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited against ‘other operating expenses’ in the income statement. Trade receivables
include unbilled services which relate to services performed but not yet billed.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**2.16 Funds held under Trust**

Client money is held in Group bank accounts on behalf of clients and is recorded separately as an asset
on the balance sheet of the Group. A corresponding liability is recognised within current liabilities to
reflect the linked character for the Group.

**2.17 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

**2.18 Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**2.19 Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

**2.20 Loans and borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method.

Costs incurred during the (re)financing of loans and borrowings are capitalized and amortised over the
estimated useful lives of the loans and borrowings. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility
will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawn-down occurs. To the extent there is no
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee for the facility is
capitalised and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Loans and borrowings are
presented net of capitalized costs.

Loans and borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**2.21 Current and deferred income tax**

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operate and generate taxable
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulations is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an
asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable income statement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

F-106

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset
current tax receivables against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and
liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**2.22 Employee benefits**

**Pension obligations**

The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world. The schemes are generally
funded through payments to insurance companies. The Group has both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to
employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a
defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of
service and compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in Euro
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains or losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as an
employee benefit expense when they fall due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**Annual leave**

Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as
the benefits are earned. An accrual is made at balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays
earned but not yet taken.

**2.23 Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as an interest expense.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are outlined below.

**3.1 Impairment of goodwill**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the
accounting policy stated in note 2.12. The operating segments of the Group are determined to be the
level at which goodwill is allocated and tested for impairment, as monitoring for internal management
purposes does not take place on a lower level. The allocation of goodwill is made to those CGU’s or
groups of CGU’s that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The recoverable amounts of CGU’s have been determined based on the higher of the value in use and
the fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions
consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by
management. Refer to note 13 for the key assumptions used for the recoverable amount calculations.

**3.2 Impairment of trade receivables**

The Group periodically tests whether trade receivables have suffered any impairment, in accordance
with the accounting policy stated in note 2.15. The calculation of the allowance account for trade
receivables requires the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the latest available
information regarding the clients.

**3.3 Provisions**

The provisions of the Group mainly relate to legal cases, restructurings and loss making contracts. Refer
to note 2.23 for the general accounting policies used and to note 25 for more details regarding the three
categories mentioned above.

**3.4 Fair value estimation with respect to financial instruments**

There are three valuation methods to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The different levels
have been defined as follows:

— Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

— Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs) (Level 3).

As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the only financial instruments that are accounted for to
fair value are derivative financial instruments (2010: none). The fair value of all derivative financial
instruments is based on the Level 2 method mentioned above.

The fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined
by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of
interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
observable yield curves.

Refer to note 24 for further information on derivative financial instruments.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

**4.1 Financial risk factors**

The Group’s operating activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall
financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

Financial risk management is carried out by the Group’s central treasury department (Group Treasury)
under policies approved by management. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial
risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. Management provides written principles for
overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange
risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments
and investments of excess liquidity.

The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so,
fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates
and the currency exposure of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.

**4.2 Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that unexpected interest rate changes negatively affect the Group’s results,
cash flows and equity.

It is the Group’s policy to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility on its results, cash flows and
balance sheet within certain boundaries. As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the
Group’s income and operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest
rates.

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates
expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair
value interest rate risk.

The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a periodic basis. Based on this analysis and in close
consideration with the banks, the Group determines whether derivative financial instruments should be
in place to limit the interest rate risk to an acceptable level. For the derivative financial instruments in
place, reference is made to note 24.

At 31 December 2012, if Euro, US Dollar and GBP market interest rates had been 100 basis points
higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been approximately
e4.1 million lower/higher. At 31 December 2011 the loss for the year would have been approximately
e5.4 million lower/higher and at 31 December 2010 e4.6 million lower/higher.

**4.3 Foreign currency exchange risk**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and related currencies. In several markets
client contracts are denominated in Euro or US Dollars although this is not the local currency.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and
investments in foreign operations. Currently, no hedging of foreign exchange risk takes places.

The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign
operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. As
such, the Group does not apply for net investment hedge accounting in its financial statements.

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

As at 31 December 2012, if Euro had strengthened/weakened by 5% against the US Dollar with all
variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been e3.2 million higher/lower, mainly due to
operating results in USD. As at 31 December 2011, the loss for the year would have been e3.0 million
lower/higher and as at 31 December 2010 e1.0 million lower/higher.

**4.4 Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that counterparties fail to meet their contractual payment obligations through
insolvency or default as well as credit exposure to clients.

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions is managed centrally. For banks and financial institutions, the Group’s
policy is that only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘BBB’ are accepted. However, in
certain circumstances (e.g. due to local regislation) banks and financial institutions are used that are not
rated and/or that do not have a minimum ‘BBB’ rating. The use of these banks and financial institutions is
kept to the minimum level possible, closely monitored by the Group Treasury department and
periodically reported to the Board of Directors.

Credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions, are
managed on a local basis. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for
each of their clients. Approval from management is mandatory before standard payment terms and
delivery terms and conditions are contractually agreed with new clients. The gross amount of trade
receivables and the corresponding allowance are only written-off in case of bankruptcy of clients.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum credit risk exposure of the
Group’s financial assets at the end of the period is represented by the amounts reported under the
corresponding balance sheet headings.

**4.5 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient headroom (cash and cash equivalents
plus committed credit lines) available to meet both the Group’s day-to-day operating requirements and
debt servicing obligations (interest and debt repayment).

Group Treasury mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring the Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable
securities, the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the
ability to close out market positions.

Cash flow forecasting is performed by management of the operating entities of the Group which is
consolidated by Group Finance. These rolling forecasts are monitored to ensure the Group’s cash and
liquidity requirements are sufficient to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom on
its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 23). This enables management to monitor compliance
with borrowing limits and debt covenants on its borrowing facilities.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
period remaining to contractual maturity date. The cash flows with respect to operating lease
commitments are shown in note 29. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual

**4.6 Capital risk management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns to shareholders, benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group’s loan and borrowings is considered as
the most important item from capital management perspecitive.

The Group is highly leveraged and management focus is on cash generation and an important KPI used
in this respect is the cash conversion ratio. This focus should make it possible for the Group to pay
interest and repay the loans in time.

During 2010, 2011 and 2012 the Group complied with its banking covenants. Following the refinancing
of the senior bank debt with Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes in December 2012, financial
covenants based on financial ratios are only applicable for the revolver credit facility and are budgeted to
be achieved. The only financial covenant under the revolver credit facility relates to the ratio of Net Debt
to EBITDA.

**5.** **Segment information**

The Board of Directors is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the
operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors for the purpose of
allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board of Directors considers the business mainly
from a geographic perspective. However, a part of the business does not fall under one of the
geographic regions and is therefore disclosed separately.

The Group has operations in the following operating segments and locations of offices:

— Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (‘Benelux’);

— Europe, the Middle East and Africa, excluding Benelux (‘EMEA’);

— The countries of North and South America (‘Americas’);

— The countries of the Asia Pacific region (‘APAC’);

— Fund Services; and

— All other.

**5.** **Segment information (Continued)**

Although the segment Fund Services does not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for
reportable segments, management has concluded that this segment should be reported as it is closely
monitored by the Board of Directors similar to the other operating segments.

The category ‘All other’ includes the operations of International Licensing and Collection (Freeway) and
International Pensions (Panthera) and the corporate expenses of the Group.

The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segments based on both external
revenue and results from operations. This measurement basis excludes the effects of ‘other income/
expenses’ and ‘depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges’. The measure also excludes the
effects of finance income and expenses since this type of activity is mainly driven by Group treasury,
which manages the cash position of the Group. Inter-segment revenue comprises management fees
and services provided to clients by other entities in the Group. Inter-segment transfers or transactions
are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to
unrelated third parties.

**11. Income tax expense (Continued)**

The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax
rates applicable in the Netherlands on the profits of the consolidated entities as shown below:

**In thousands of Euro** **2012** **2011** **2010**

Profit/(loss) for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (42,291) (74,222) (11,704)

Profit/(loss) before income tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (35,386) (67,482) (4,493)

Tax calculated at the Company’s domestic applicable tax rate
(25%/25%/25.5%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (8,847) (16,870) (1,146)

Tax losses where no deferred income tax asset was recognized 13,912 21,321 5,623

**Tax charge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **6,905** **6,740** **7,211**

**Weighted average effective tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(20)%** **(10)%** **(160)%**

The applicable tax rate decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as the corporate income tax rate in the
Netherlands decreased with 0.5% in 2011.

**12. Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result attributable to owners of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares
purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.

Basic earnings per share is calculated as follows:

**2012** **2011** **2010**

Result for the year attributable to owners of the parent (in thousand
of Euro) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (40,902) (72,748) (11,937)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (in thousands) 18 18 18

**Basic earnings per share (in Euro) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(2,272)** **(4,042)** **(663)**

Since the Company has no convertible debt or share options, the diluted earnings per share equals the
basic earnings per share.

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The operating segments of the Group are determined to be the level at which goodwill is allocated and
tested for impairment, as monitoring for internal management purposes does not take place on a lower
level. The allocation of goodwill is made to those CGU’s or groups of CGU’s that are expected to benefit
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of the value in use and fair value
less costs to sell. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on 2013 financial budgets
and the five year forecast approved by management. Cash flows beyond the five year period are
extrapolated using an estimated perpetual growth rate.

The fair value of the senior loan notes is based on its listing price. The fair value of the unsecured related
party loans and the unsecured subordinated loan is calculated based upon 10-year government bonds
of 1.5% at 31 December 2012, 2.2% at 31 December 2011 and 3.09% at 31 December 2010. The fair
value of the other loans equals the carrying amount as these loans have variable interest rates. Refer to

The senior loan notes and revolver credit facility are secured over the shares, bank accounts, trade
receivables and intercompany receivables of several entities within the Group.

**25. Provisions (Continued)**

**Legal**

The legal provisions relate to costs with regard to legal cases in subsidiaries of the Group. Management
considers there are no material uncertainties as to the amount provided for. The amount provided for
relates to costs that will be incurred in these legal cases. It is unknown when the legal provisions will be
used. For further details reference is made to note 30.

**Restructuring**

The restructuring provisions have been created to cover the Equity Trust integration costs, mainly in the
Netherlands. Integration costs include staff redundancies and onerous office lease agreements.
Management considers there are no material uncertainties as to the amount provided for. A substantial
part of the restructuring provisions will be used in 2013. The remainder will be used in the period
2014–2018.

**Loss making contracts**

The provision for loss making client contracts in Jersey and Hong Kong covers unavoidable future
losses as a result of these contracts. Management considers there are no material uncertainties as to the
amount provided for. The provision is expected to be fully used in 2013.

**26. Retirement benefit obligations**

As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Group operates four average salary pension
schemes in the Netherlands, for its employees with a retirement age between 62 and 65 years and an
entry age between 18 years and 25 years. Approximately 70% of the employees’ average salary is
accrued. The scheme is an insurance scheme whereby the insurer will pay future annuities for which it
receives annual premiums from the employing company and (a part of) the employees. The assets in the
scheme partly represent the market value of the funded benefits at the insurer, the (expected) interest
profit sharing and the current account with the insurer, and partly represent the market value of
investments in bonds. The liabilities in the scheme represent the present value of the current and future
defined benefit pension obligations. There is only in certain specific circumstances a legal obligation on
the Group subsidiaries to fund any reported deficit in these schemes.

As at 31 December 2010, the Group operated three average salary pension schemes in the Netherlands,
for its employees with a retirement age of 62 years and an entry age of 21 years. Approximately 70% of
the employees’ average salary is accrued. The scheme is an insurance scheme whereby the insurer will
pay future annuities for which it receives annual premiums from the employing company and (a part of)
the employees. The assets in the scheme partly represent the market value of the funded benefits at the
insurer, the (expected) interest profit sharing and the current account with the insurer, and partly
represent the market value of investments in bonds. The liabilities in the scheme represent the present
value of the current and future defined benefit pension obligations. There is only in certain specific
circumstances a legal obligation on the Group subsidiaries to fund any reported deficit in these
schemes.

All retirement benefit obligations are of a long term nature.

The Group decided to early adopt IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’ as amended on June 2011. Consequently,
comparative figures in this note have been adjusted unless mentioned otherwise. For the full impact of
the adoption of the revised IAS19, reference is made to note 2.1.

As a consequence, those entities and TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are jointly and severally liable for
corporate income tax liabilities of the fiscal unity.

**30. Contingencies**

**Legal claims**

The Group has contingent liabilities in respect to legal claims. The most material claims are described
below.

_Case 1_

Certain investors in property investment and development trusts and companies in respect of which
certain Group companies provided trustee, director and administration services in Jersey have
threatened legal proceedings and/or have filed complaints with the Jersey regulator against these
Group companies. Additionally, a claim was filed commencing proceedings in Jersey in December 2010
against two Group companies by the current trustee and manager of three collective investment funds
which invested in property development structures in respect of which the relevant Group companies
previously acted as trustee or manager. Both the threatened legal proceedings and the filed claim
involve investors claiming losses of substantial sums of money in connection with the underlying
property investments in Eastern Europe. The claims allege breach of trust, breach of contract, and
breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the relevant Group companies. Certain of the Group companies’
activities in Jersey are regulated and the Jersey regulator is currently investigating the Group
companies’ actions relating to this dispute, including the handling of the investor complaints referred to
above.

_Case 2_

During 2011, Custom House (a company of whose shares are owned by the Group for 50.18%) received
a letter from the liquidators in respect of various linked funds which made certain allegations against that
company (who acted as administrator of such funds) and one of its individual directors (who also acted
as a director of one of the funds) and its/his alleged role in the collapse of the funds, which are now in
liquidation in the Cayman Islands. The liquidators claimed damages in this respect. In October 2011, a
writ of summons was filed in the Cayman Islands and a Notice of Arbitration was served, claiming

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**30. Contingencies (Continued)**

substantial damages but both the litigation and the arbitration have been stayed while the parties try to
resolve the claims via mediation.

_Case 3_

Some Group company acted as one of the directors of a Dutch holding company whose subsidiary
owned a foreign property. Additional shares were issued by the subsidiary that resulted in the dilution of
the Dutch holding company’s (and its shareholders) indirect interest in the overseas property. Legal
proceedings were initiated with the Dutch Enterprise Chamber by one of the shareholders in the Dutch
holding company alleging mismanagement by all three of its directors (only one of whom, as noted
above, was a Group company). The Dutch Enterprise Chamber initially found that there was
mismanagement on the part of all the directors, but the Group company is appealing the decision.
Recently the respective shareholder started civil proceedings against the Group company.The Group
company will severly challenge the claims.

_Case 4_

Some Group company provided certain services in connection with a structured finance transaction,
whereby receivables from a bank were transferred to a special purpose vehicle (‘‘SPV’’) managed and
administrated by the Group company. The SPV issued notes to investors. The note Trustee on behalf of
the noteholders filed a claim in Luxembourg against the Group company in November 2012 claiming
that certain formalities were not complied with in respect to the transferring of underlying assets as a
result of which the SPV might suffer a loss and cannot fully repay the noteholders.

_Case 5_

A Group company is one of the trustees of an Asian based pension scheme of which certain investors
are in a dispute with HM Revenue & Customs regarding the revocation of the pension schemes
‘‘Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme’’ status in 2008. The English High Court delivered a
judgment in 2011, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2012, concluding that the pension
scheme was not entitled to this status. As a result, certain investors have commenced a class action
against HM Revenue & Customs. If the investors ultimately lose the dispute, they would be subject to tax
at a relatively high rate. No claims have been commenced against the Group company, but some
investors have indicated that they reserve their rights to do so in the future.

_Case 6_

The liquidators of an English company, of which during a prior period a certain Group company had
provided directors and administration services in Jersey, in February 2013 served legal proceedings
against its former directors and the Group company. The primary assets of the English company
consisted of substantial London property. The legal proceedings involve allegations of sale of the
London property to a related entity at an undervalue, recovery of an associated loan and income
generated by the London property.

While the Group cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing matters, based upon information currently
available to the Group and in light of the Group’s insurance coverage management does not believe that
the final outcome of these proceedings and any threatened proceedings will have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Group has contingent liabilities in respect to other legal claims arising from the normal course of
business. It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities other than
those provided for.

To the General Meeting of Shareholders of TMF Group Holding B.V.

**Report on the consolidated financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements 2011 as set out on pages 16 to 61
which are part of the financial statements of TMF Group Holding B.V., Amsterdam, which comprise the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2011, the consolidated income statement, the
statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the
notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

**Directors’ responsibility**

The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Directors’ review
and Financial review in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the
directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing.
This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

**Opinion with respect to the consolidated financial statements**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of
TMF Group Holding B.V. as at 31 December 2011, and of its result and its cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

Pursuant to the legal requirement under Section 2: 393 sub 5 at e and f of the Dutch Civil Code, we have no
deficiencies to report as a result of our examination whether the Directors’ review and Financial review, to
the extent we can assess, have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of this Code, and
whether the information as required under Section 2: 392 sub 1 at b-h has been annexed. Further we
report that the Directors’ review and Financial review, to the extent we can assess, is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements as required by Section 2: 391 sub 4 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1.** **General information**

TMF Group Holding B.V. (the ‘Company’) and its associated companies (together the ‘Group’) is
specialised in facilitating clients to operate and invest seamlessly across borders.

The Company was incorporated in the Netherlands on 3 August 2004. The address of the registered
office is at Herikerbergweg 238, 1101 CM Amsterdam Zuidoost. The Company principally acts as a
holding and finance company for group investments.

The shares in the Company are 100% held by TMF Group HoldCo B.V. 65% of the ordinary shares in
TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are indirectly held by Doughty Hanson & Co V (which comprises a series of
English limited partnerships with each limited partnership having a common general partner in Doughty
Hanson & Co V Limited) and indirectly by the employees of affiliates of Doughty Hanson & Co V Limited.
The remaining 35% of the ordinary shares in TMF Group HoldCo B.V. are indirectly held by the
management and employees of the Group.

TMF Group HoldCo B.V. prepares also consolidated financial statements that are available to the public.

This consolidated 2011 Annual Report of TMF Group Holding B.V. was authorised for issue by the Board
of Directors on 18 June 2012. Until approval at the annual general shareholders meeting, the Board of
Directors can amend the financial statements.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principle accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless stated
otherwise.

**2.1 Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through income statement.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 3 (critical accounting estimates and judgements).

**Going concern**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern convention. The
Board of Directors is confident that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current cash flow
projections and available facilities, it has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

**New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2011**

There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year
beginning on or after 1 January 2011 that would be expected to have a material impact to the group.

**New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

The following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been issued
but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2011.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. The impact on the Group will be as follows: to
eliminate the corridor approach and recognise all actuarial gains and losses in Other comprehensinve
income as they occur; to immediately recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and
expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate
to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendments
and intends to adopt IAS 19 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial
assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the
parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires
financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39
requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial
liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting
period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of
control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the
determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact
and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other
off balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12
no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a
precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure
requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and
US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be
applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The
Group is yet to assess IFRS13’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting
period beginning on or after 1 January 2012.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the Group.

**2.2 Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when
assessing whether the Group controls a specific entity. The Group also assesses existence of control
where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power but is able to govern the financial and
operating policies by virtue of de-facto control. De-facto control may arise in circumstances where the
size of the Group’s voting power rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings or other
shareholders give the group the power to govern the financial and operating policies, etc.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
considerations transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any controlling interest in
the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifable net assets.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through
income statement.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset
or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in income statement or as a change to other
comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair
value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this
consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised in income statement.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group
companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are
recognised in assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control**

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity
transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests
are also recorded in equity.

**Disposal of subsidiaries**

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value, with the change in the carrying amount recognized in the income statement.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained
interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amount previously recognized in
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to income statement.

**Special purpose entities**

The Group has established a number of special purpose entities (‘SPE’s’) on behalf of its clients. A SPE
is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the Group and the
SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. As at 31 December 2011, no
SPE’s established on behalf of clients were consolidated.

**2.3 Segment reporting**

A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that
are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic
environments. A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services
that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.

**2.4 Foreign currency translation**

**Functional and presentation currency**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros (‘e’), which is the Company’s functional
and the Group’s presentation currency.

**Transactions and balances**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the Company using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement.

**Group companies**

The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Euro are translated into
Euro as follows:

(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;

(b) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and

(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of equity.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such
investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold,
exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognized in the income statement as part of the
gain or loss on sale.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5 Revenue recognition**

The Group recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable
that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group bases its estimates on historical results,
taking into consideration the type of client, transaction and the specifics of each arrangement. Revenue
is shown net of value added tax, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.

**Service contracts**

The Group’s sole source of revenue is from the rendering of services. The Group provides its services to
clients on a time and cost basis or based upon a fixed price contract, with contract terms generally
ranging from less than one year to longer term client relationships.

F-160


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Revenue from time and cost contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as time has been spent and
direct expenses are incurred.

Revenue from fixed price contracts is generally recognized in the period in which the services are
provided, using a straight line basis over the term of the contract.

If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress
toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in
estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
give rise to the revision become known.

To the extent that any fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in
trade and other payables as deferred income.

**2.6 Other income and expenses**

Other income and expenses include those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions
which may give rise to Other income and expenses are principally gains and losses on disposal of
investments and subsidiaries, acquisition due diligence, start-up and integration related costs as well as
redundancy and restructuring costs.

**2.7 Leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group leases certain equipment and software, where the Group has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership. These leases are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at
the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the
minimum lease payments.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The interest element of the
finance costs is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets acquired
under the financial lease is depreciated/ amortised over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the
lease term.

**2.8 Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case
it is recognized in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Refer to note 2.21 on deferred income tax.

**2.9 Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired entity or business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of entities or businesses is included in intangible assets. Separately recognized goodwill is

F-161


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment
losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity or business include
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity or business sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is
made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The Group allocates goodwill to each region
in which it operates (also refer to note 2.11).

**Client lists**

Client lists, including client relationships, acquired by the Group have finite useful lives. Client lists are
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Separate
values are not attributed to internally generated client lists or relationships. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client lists over their estimated useful lives
(2-16 years).

**Non-compete agreements**

Non-compete agreements entered into by the Group have finite useful lives. Non-compete agreements
are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line
method to allocate the cost of the non-compete agreements over the period of their enforceability
(1-5 years).

**Brands**

Brands acquired by the Group have finite useful lives. Brands are valued using the relief from royalty
method. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the brand over
the period of its estimated useful life (4-20 years).

**Computer software**

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of
three years.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognized as an
expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Computer software
development costs recognized as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (a period not
exceeding three years).

**2.10 Tangible fixed assets**

**Recognition and measurement**

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost
includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Historical costs include
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item. Cost also include borrowing costs
attributable to the investment insofar as these have been incurred as a result of unavoidable passage of
time needed to prepare the item for its intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the
functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

F-162


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Depreciation**

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost to
their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

— Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25-50 years
— Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . term of the lease
— Furniture and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
— Office and computer equipment . . . . 3-5 years
— Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 years

The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance
sheet date.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (also refer to note 2.11).

**Disposal**

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and
are recognized within other income/(expenses)—net, in the income statement.

**2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment (e.g. goodwill). Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs
to sell and value in use.

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). For goodwill impairment testing is performed
at a regional level. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**2.12 Financial assets**

The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:

— at fair value through income statement;

— loans and receivables; or

— available for sale.

The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management
determines the classification of the financial assets at initial recognition.

**Financial assets at fair value through income statement**

Financial assets at fair value through income statement are financial assets held for trading. A financial
asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than

F-163


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans
and receivables comprise ‘non-current bank deposits’ and ‘loans due from related parties’.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management
intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade-date on which the Group
commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Investments are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried
at fair value through income statement. Financial assets carried at fair value through income statement
are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through income statement
are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through income
statement’ category are presented in the income statement within operating income, in the period in
which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through income statement is
recognized in the income statement as part of other income when the Group’s right to receive payments
is established.

Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in a foreign currency and classified as
available-for-sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in amortised cost
of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. The translation differences on
monetary securities are recognized in income statement; translation differences on non-monetary
securities are recognized in equity. Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities
classified as available for sale are recognized in equity.

When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value
adjustments recognized in equity are included in the income statement as gains and losses from
investment securities.

Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognized in the
income statement as part of other income. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are
recognized in the income statement as part of other income when the Group’s right to receive payment
is established.

If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair
value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions,
reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option
pricing models, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific
inputs.

The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for
sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an
indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial
assets, the cumulative loss—measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current
fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in income statement—
is removed from equity and recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in the

F-164

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. Impairment
testing of trade receivables and unbilled services is described in note 2.14 respectively 2.15.

**2.13 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the
item being hedged. The Group sometimes designates certain derivates as cash flow hedges of
particular risks associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.

The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.

The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21.
Movements on the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 19.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the
remaining maturity of the hedge item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability
when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months. The Group has no trading derivatives.

**Cash flow hedge**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognized immediately in the income statement within ‘other income/(expense)—net’.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to income statement in the periods when the hedged
item affects income statement (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain
or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is
recognized in the income statement within net finance costs.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement within ‘other income/(expense)—net’.

**Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting**

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in the income statement within net finance costs.

**2.14 Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of
trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of
the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the assets is
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the

F-165


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

income statement within ‘Sales, general and administrative costs’. When a trade receivable is
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries
of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘Sales, general and administrative costs’ in the
income statement.

**2.15 Unbilled services**

Unbilled services relates to services performed but not yet billed. Unbilled services are carried at fair
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an
allowance for impairment which is determined as described in the previous paragraph, trade
receivables.

**2.16 Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown
within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.

**2.17 Funds held under trust**

Client money is held in Group bank accounts on behalf of clients and is recorded as an asset on the
balance sheet of the Group. A corresponding liability is offset against this asset to reflect the balanced
financial position of the Group.

**2.18 Share capital**

Ordinary shares and preference shares are classified as equity.

**2.19 Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

**2.20 Loans and borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method.

Costs incurred during the (re)financing of loans and borrowings are capitalized and amortised over the
estimated useful lives of the loans and borrowings. Loans and borrowings are presented net of
capitalized costs.

Loans and borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**2.21 Current and deferred income tax**

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operate and generate taxable
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulations is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an

F-166


-----

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable income statement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

**2.22 Employee benefits**

**Pension obligations**

The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world. The schemes are generally
funded through payments to insurance companies. The Group has both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to
employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a
defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of
service and compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets,
together with adjustments for unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined
benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in Euro
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

Actuarial gains or losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of 10% of the value of
plan assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are charged or credited to the income statement
over the employees’ expected average remaining working lives.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as an
employee benefit expense when they fall due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**Annual leave**

Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as
the benefits are earned. An accrual is made at balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays
earned but not yet taken.

**2.23 Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

F-167

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as an interest expense.

**3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are outlined below.

**3.1 Impairment of goodwill**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the
accounting policy stated in note 2.11. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been
determined based on fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of estimates and
assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved
by management. Refer to note 11 for the key assumptions used for the fair value less costs to sell
calculations.

**3.2 Impairment of trade receivables and unbilled services**

The Group periodically tests whether trade receivables and unbilled services have suffered any
impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.14 and 2.15. The calculation of the
allowance account for trade receivables and unbilled services requires the use of estimates and
assumptions consistent with the latest available information regarding the clients.

**3.3 Income taxes**

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences
will impact the income tax, deferred income tax provisions and tax losses carried forward in the period in
which such determination is made. The tax position includes estimates made in respect of the tax
deductibility of certain costs. This is inherent to the fact that the tax calculations are made in a complex
international environment.

**3.4 Retirement benefits**

Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial
assumptions. Significant judgement is required in determining these actuarial assumptions. Refer to
note 23 for the principle assumptions used.

**3.5 Provisions**

The provisions of the Group mainly relate to legal cases, restructurings and loss making contracts. Refer
to note 2.23 for the general accounting policies used and to note 22 for more details regarding the three
categories mentioned above.

**3.6 Fair value estimation with respect to financial instruments**

There are three valuation methods to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The different levels
have been defined as follows:

- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs) (Level 3).

As at 31 December 2011, the only financial instruments that are accounted for to fair value are derivative
financial instruments (2010: none). The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is based on the
Level 2 method mentioned above.

The fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined
by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. The fair value of
interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
observable yield curves.

Refer to note 21 for further information on derivative financial instruments.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

**4.1 Financial risk factors**

The Group’s operating activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall
financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

Financial risk management is carried out by our central treasury department (Group Treasury) under
policies approved by management. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in
close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. Management provides written principles for overall
risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk,
interest rate risk, credit risk, use of financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and
investments of excess liquidity.

The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so,
fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates
and the currency exposure of certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.

To achieve this, the management monitors these exposures and where deemed appropriate the Group
enters into currency and interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange
contracts to manage the volatility relating to these exposures.

**4.2 Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk that unexpected interest rate changes negatively affect the Group’s results,
cash flows and equity.

It is the Group’s policy to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility on its results, cash flows and
balance sheet. As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and
operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates
expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair
value interest rate risk.

The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Various scenarios are simulated
taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined
interest rate shift and determines whether derivative financial instruments should be in place to limit the
interest rate risk to an acceptable level.

At 31 December 2011, if Euro, US Dollar and GBP market interest rates had been 100 basis points
higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been approximately
e5.4 million (2010: e4.6 million) lower/higher.

**4.3 Foreign currency exchange risk**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar. In several markets client contracts are
denominated in Euro or US Dollars although this is not the local currency.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and
investments in foreign operations.

The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign
operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes. All derivatives are
approved by management prior to committing the Group. As at 31 December 2011, no currency
derivatives were outstanding.

As at 31 December 2011, if Euro had strengthened/weakened by 1% against the US Dollar with all
variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been e0.6 million lower/higher (2010:
e0.2 million lower/higher), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains on translation of US Dollar
denominated borrowings and trade payables compensated by foreign exchange losses on translation of
US Dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents.

**4.4 Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that counterparties fail to meet their contractual payment obligations through
insolvency or default as well as credit exposure to clients.

Credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions is managed centrally. Credit exposures to clients, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions, are managed on a local basis.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum credit risk exposure of the
Group’s financial assets at the end of the period is represented by the amounts reported under the
corresponding balance sheet headings.

**4.5 Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient headroom (cash and cash equivalents
plus committed credit lines) available to meet both the Group’s day-to-day operating requirements and
debt servicing obligations (interest and debt repayment).

Group Treasury mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring the Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable
securities, the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the
ability to close out market positions.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4.** **Financial risk management (Continued)**

Cash flow forecasting is performed by management of the operating entities of the Group which is
consolidated by Group Finance. These rolling forecasts are monitored to ensure the Group’s cash and
liquidity requirements are sufficient to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom on
its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 20). This enables management to monitor compliance
with borrowing limits and debt covenants on its borrowing facilities.

The forecast cash and cash equivalents are as follows:

**In thousands of Euro** **2012** **2013 – 2014**

Opening cash and cash equivalents for the period (note 17) . . . . . . . . . 68,257 83,015

**Closing cash and cash equivalents for the period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **83,015** **141,019**

In addition to the above, as at 31 December 2011, the Group had e53.7 million (2010: e12.5 million)
funds available from a Revolving Credit facility held by its parent company.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
period remaining to contractual maturity date. The cash flows with respect to operating lease
commitments are shown in note 25. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months are equal to their carrying balances as the
impact of discounting is not significant.

**4.6 Capital risk management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns to shareholders, benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Since the Group is highly leveraged, management focus is on cash generation and an important KPI
used in this respect is the cash conversion ratio. This focus should make it possible for the Group to pay
interest and repay the loans in time.

During 2011 the Group has complied with the banking covenants. For 2012 the following covenants
should, and are budgeted to, be reached:

**31 December 2012**

Cash cover (consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service) . . . . . . . . . . . . - 1.00
Interest cover (adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest) . . . . . . - 2.42
Adjusted Leverage (consolidated total net debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA) < 5.28

The Group invests in acquisitions that provide additional scale to our business or assists in consolidating
fragmented markets, by:

— filling geographic gaps;

— increasing our presence in existing markets; and

— increasing our presence in specific service lines.

With an effective date of 1 January 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Equity Trust
(Equity Trust Holding S.`ar.l, Luxembourg), for a total consideration of e215.1 million, and merged this
business into the Group. The cash outflow from this aquisition, net of cash acquired, was e172.2 million.

The goodwill recognized on acquisitions is attributable to the skills and technical talent of the acquired
business’s workforce, and the synergies and other benefits expected to be achieved from integrating the
respective businesses into the Group. Besides this, goodwill includes the effect of the deferred tax
liabilities and non-recurring clients.

None of the additional Goodwill is tax deductible.

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to region of
operation. Impairment testing is done based on regions.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on fair value less costs to sell. These calculations
use pre-tax cash flow projections based on 2012 financial budgets and the five year forecast approved
by management. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated perpetual
growth rate.

(a) Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projection.

(b) Budgeted EBITDA growth.

(c) Budgeted growth after 5 years.

These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each region.

**Sensitivity analysis**

A sensitivity analysis was performed by using (1) a 1% higher discount rate and (2) 1% less cash flows in
our projections. These scenarios would have led to no additional impairment.

The fair value of the unsecured related party loans and the unsecured subordinated loan is calculated
based upon 10-year government bonds of 2.2% (2010: 3.09%). The fair value of the other loans equals
the carrying amount as these loans have variable interest rates. Refer to note 28 for further information
on related party loans.

The bank loans are secured over the shares, bank accounts, trade receivables and intercompany
receivables of several entities within the Group.

The effective interest rate of the secured senior bank loans is 1.80% (2010: 1.33%) higher than the
nominal interest rate due to capitalised finance costs.

**23. Retirement benefit obligations**

As at 31 December 2011, the Group operates four average salary pension schemes in The Netherlands,
for its employees with a retirement age between 62 and 65 years and an entry age between 18 years and
25 years. Approximately 70% of the employees’ average salary is accrued. The scheme is an insurance
scheme whereby the insurer will pay future annuities for which it receives annual premiums from the
employing company and (a part of) the employees. The assets in the scheme partly represent the
market value of the funded benefits at the insurer, the (expected) interest profit sharing and the current
account with the insurer, and partly represent the market value of investments in bonds. The liabilities in
the scheme represent the present value of the current and future defined benefit pension obligations.

below.

F-192

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**27. Contingencies (Continued)**

_Case 1_

In Jersey some Group company had provided trustee, director and administration services to certain
property investment and development trusts and companies. A number of the investors into these trusts
and companies have threatened legal proceedings and/or have filed complaints.

In December 2010, an Order of Justice was issued in Jersey by the trustee and manager of three
collective investment funds (the ‘‘Funds’’) invested in the property development structures, to which two
Group companies were the previous trustee and manager (the ‘‘Proceedings’’). The Proceedings
contain allegations of breach of trust, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty by the Group
companies as the previous trustee and manager of the Funds. However, until the Court has ruled it is not
clear what the potential liability to Group companies is.

It is at this stage impossible to make any reasonable estimate of the value of any claims whether in the
Proceedings or otherwise.

Management is of the view that the success of the Proceedings as currently articulated is considered
unlikely.

_Case 2_

Some Group companies provided trustee and administration services in relation to a trust fund and its
underlying company. The underlying company’s assets consisted of an investment portfolio managed
by a third party on a discretionary basis. On 13 July 2011, the current trustee of the trust fund
commenced legal proceedings against the relevant Group companies, alleging breaches of trust. At this
stage it is not possible to make a precise estimate of the damages that the relevant Group companies
may be required to pay as the relevant Group companies have not received any expert evidence on the
damages and the relevant Group companies may be able to obtain a contribution from other parties.

Management current view is that they are confident that any potential contingency relating to this matter
will not lead to any impact for the Company.

_Case 3_

During 2011, a 50.18% owned Group company received a letter from the liquidators acting for various
linked funds making allegations against that company and one of its directors (which acted as director
for these funds) and its/his alleged role in the collapse of the funds. The liquidators claimed damages in
this respect, which damages are not substantiated in detail. The relevant Group company is currently
defending its position and has valid ground to believe that the claim has no merit.

Management current view is that they are confident that any potential contingency relating to this matter
will not lead to any impact for the Company.

_Other_

The Group has claims outstanding since 2004 for which previous Group shareholders have provided a
written guarantee for any material liabilities which may arise from these claims. As such, no provision has
been recognized for these claims.

The Group has contingent liabilities in respect to other legal claims arising from the normal course of
business. It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities other than
those provided for.

**Contingent assets**

During 2008 the Group sold and assigned e9.3 million of certain financial assets and deferred tax assets
to Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. is
entitled to return of 10% of the purchase price or the unrecovered portion thereof each year (‘Yield’). This

**TMF Group Holding B.V.**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**27. Contingencies (Continued)**

Yield will be calculated up to the date that Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A. has been able
to unconditionally transfer all assets to a third party or otherwise realized in cash. If the aggregated
proceeds received by Middenberm Group Holding Luxembourg S.A, for all assets are in excess of the
purchase price, increased by the Yield, then the amount of excess shall be considered as an adjustment
to the purchase price and repaid to the Group.
