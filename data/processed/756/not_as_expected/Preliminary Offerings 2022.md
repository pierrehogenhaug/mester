Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under
the Offering Memorandum will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the
Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are
a person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance
with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorised to,
deliver the Offering Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an
offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction
requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any of the Initial Purchasers of
the securities offered under the Offering Memorandum or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a
licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial
Purchaser or affiliate thereof on behalf of the issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorised person in the United Kingdom
and is for distribution only to and is directed only at persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Order”), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Order,
(iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage
in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA in connection with the issue or sale
of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such


-----

persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum must not be
acted upon by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which
the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed
or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage
in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with
the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does
not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission
and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the
Issuer, the Guarantors (each as defined in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in
respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and
any version that will be provided to you at a later date upon your request from any Initial Purchaser.

Any distributor subject to MiFID II (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes and determining the appropriate distribution channels for the
purposes of the MiFID II product governance rules under Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
2017/593 (“Delegated Directive”). Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any
representations or warranties as to a distributor’s compliance with the Delegated Directive.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) retail investors: The**
securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is
not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance/Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and
Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.


-----

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
UK MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to
completion and amendment (which may be material) without notice. The definitive terms of the
transaction will be described in the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering
Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to, constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell or the
solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as, or in connection with, any offer or invitation to
sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities described therein.

the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set out in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior
to –––––2024, the Issuer may also redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of either the GBP Notes or the EUR Notes outstanding (including Additional GBP Notes (as defined herein) or Additional EUR
Notes, (as defined herein) if any), at its option, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the GBP Notes or the EUR Notes

The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence

The Notes will be the general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of

value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness.

The Notes will not be guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target and its subsidiaries following the Acquisition). On the Issue
Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein), the Notes will be secured by limited recourse third-party security over the shares
in the Issuer held by Kane Midco Limited (the “Parent”) and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Issuer (the “Issue
**Date Collateral”). In addition, within 30 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured by the Issuer’s material bank accounts,**
its shares in the Target and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by the Target (the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and,
together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). The property and assets that will secure the Notes will also secure the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain priority hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Obligations”) on a first-ranking basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral,
the Super Senior Obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted under the Indenture (as defined herein) to be incurred on a priority basis

Collateral may be released in certain circumstances.

for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) in Guernsey, the
Channel Islands. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area_**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
**Regulation”) from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering**
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (“MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorised, nor do authorise, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other
than offers made by the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates or parent company, which constitute the
final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

**_MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Any distributor subject to MiFID II (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes and determining the appropriate distribution channels for the
purposes of the MiFID II product governance rules under Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
2017/593 (“Delegated Directive”). Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any
representations or warranties as to a distributor’s compliance with the Delegated Directive.

**_United Kingdom_**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are
persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations
etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of


-----

any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such
persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only
at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.
Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of
UK domestic law (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these
purposes, “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, “UK
**MiFIR”); or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.**
Consequently, no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of
UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**_UK MIFIR Product Governance/Professional Investors and Eligible Counterparties Only Target_**
**_Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes
is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**AVAILABLE INFORMATION**

The Issuer is not subject to the informational requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Issuer has agreed that it will make available, upon request, to
any holder or prospective purchaser of the Notes the information required pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act during any period in which it is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or exempt by virtue of Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder. Any such requests should be directed
to the Issuer at: Kane Bidco Limited, Attn: Company Secretary, Aztec Group House, 11-15 Seaton
Place, St. Helier, JE4 0QH, Jersey.

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

**General**

The Issuer is a private limited company incorporated on 27 August 2021 under the laws of Jersey. The
Issuer is a newly incorporated holding company incorporated for the purposes of consummating the
Transactions and is wholly and indirectly owned by Cinven. The Issuer has not engaged in any
activities other than those related to its formation and the Transactions. The only material assets and
liabilities of the Issuer (other than with respect to the Financing) are those of the Target Group. We do
not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer,
other than certain limited financial data presented at the Issuer level on a combined basis as adjusted
to reflect the Transactions. Unless otherwise noted, all historical financial information included in this
Offering Memorandum is that of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The historical financial information of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries included in this
Offering Memorandum, including the financial information discussed in “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, has been derived, without material_
adjustment, from:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target for each of the three years ended 31
December 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “Audited Financial Statements”), which are presented in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard” applicable in the
United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law) (“UK GAAP”), and in accordance
with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006; and

- the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Target for each of the
nine-month periods ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, which are presented in compliance with
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 104, “Interim
Financial Reporting” applicable in the United Kingdom and the UK Companies Act 2006 (the
“Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Financial Statements, the
“Financial Statements”).

The Financial Statements are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information on an as adjusted basis to give
_pro forma effect to the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the_
application of the net proceeds thereof as described in “Use of Proceeds”. See “Summary—Summary
_Historical Financial and Other Information” and “Capitalisation”. The adjusted information is provided_
for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or
financial position would have been if this Offering had occurred, in the case of net debt, on 30
September 2021 or, in the case of interest expense, on 1 October 2020. The adjusted information set
forth in this Offering Memorandum is based upon available information and certain assumptions and
estimates that we believe are reasonable. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future
results following consummation of the Transactions. The adjusted information has not been prepared
in accordance with the pro forma information requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the
Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting
standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial
information have been audited or reviewed.

The Target intends, but is not obligated, to change the reporting standard used for its financial
reporting from UK GAAP to IFRS on or before the delivery of its annual report for the fiscal year ending
31 December 2022.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your
own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences among UK GAAP, IFRS and United


-----

States Generally Agreed Accounting Principles, and how those differences could affect the financial
information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with either UK GAAP or IFRS requires the use of
certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the
process of applying the Target Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial
statements, are disclosed in our Financial Statements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies”._

**Restatement of 2020 Financial Information**

In connection with the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements, we restated certain profit and
loss and balance sheet information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020. Unless otherwise
indicated, such financial information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020 presented in this
Offering Memorandum is the restated information as it is presented in the Interim Financial Statements.

Administrative expenses for the year ended 31 December 2020 have been restated from £42.5 million
to £39.9 million. In October 2019, the Target Group undertook a share buy back from FTV – True, LLC
and re-financed the Target Group’s financing facilities, in the process legal and arrangement fees were
incurred which were incorrectly capitalised as “other intangibles”. During the period the directors of the
Target have reassessed the nature and treatment of these costs and have reclassified them from “other
intangibles” to “borrowings”, reducing creditors: amounts falling due in more than one year. The
related amortisation has been reclassified from “administrative expenses” to “interest”. The
comparative financial information has been restated to effect this change with £19.5 million being
reclassified from “other intangibles” to “borrowings” and £2.3 million from “administrative expenses”
to “interest” at 31 December 2020. There has been no impact on reported profit or net assets as a
result of this reclassification.

Operating profit before goodwill amortisation for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated
from £66.0 million to £68.6 million.

Operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated from £50.6 million to
£53.1 million.

Interest payable and similar charges for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated from
£31.1 million to £33.6 million.

Tax on profit for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated from a credit amounted to
£6.3 million to a tax amounted to £7.3 million. The adjustment is relating to a reduction in the deferred
tax charge in 2019 by £13.6 million offset by an equal and opposite increase in the deferred tax charge
in 2020, which is with respect to a deferred tax charge that was recognised in 2019 and reversed in
2020. The reversal in 2020 was incorrectly treated as an in-period adjustment rather than a prior year
adjustment. There is no impact on the closing deferred tax liability as at 31 December 2020.

Profit for the period for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated from £25.8 million to
£12.2 million.

**Non-GAAP Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures, referred to as “Non-GAAP
**Measures”, that are not recognised by UK GAAP and that may not be permitted to appear on the face**
of the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto.

Non-GAAP Measures used in this Offering Memorandum are AUA, AUM, CAT-Managed Assets,
Run-Rate Adjustments, Gross Asset Inflows, Integrated Flows, Client AUA Churn, Net Revenue, Net
Revenue Margin, Recurring Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Operating
Cash Flow before Taxes, Cash Flow Conversion and Free Cash Flow. For additional information on the


-----

calculation of these metrics, see below and refer to “Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial and Operating Information—Other Financial and Operating Information”._

- “AUA” refers to our assets under administration, representing the total market value of all financial
assets invested on the True Potential platform as at a certain date.

- “AUM” refers to our assets under management, representing the total market value of all financial
assets invested in TPI Funds (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) as at a certain date.

- “CAT-Managed Assets” represents AUM on which the Central Advice Team (as defined in this
Offering Memorandum) advises as at a certain date.

- “Run-Rate Adjustments” represents the difference between the annualised platform fees, fund
fees and advice fees that would have been earned during a period based on financial assets
invested as at the end date of the period less the actual platform fees, fund fees and advice
earned over the period.

- “Gross Asset Inflows” represents total assets added to AUA during a period.

- “Integrated Flows” represents the percentage of Gross Asset Inflows that were invested in TPI
Funds (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) during a period.

- “Client AUA Churn” represents AUA outflows during a period as a percentage of average AUA
for the period.

- “Net Revenue” represents turnover minus cost of sales for a period. Net Revenue is equivalent
to gross profit as presented in the Financial Statements.

- “Net Revenue Margin” represents Net Revenue for a period divided by average AUA for the
period.

- “Recurring Net Revenue” represents revenue received during a period from retained clients who
have assets on the platform and are receiving advice from us.

- “Adjusted Net Revenue” represents Net Revenue adjusted for Run-Rate Adjustments.

- “EBITDA” represents profit before taxation plus interest payable and amortisation and
depreciation.

- “EBITDA Margin” represents EBITDA divided by Net Revenue.

- “Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA adjusted (i) for run-rate adjustments to reflect assets as
at the end of the period and (ii) to include exceptional items adjustments.

- “Operating Cash Flow before Taxes” represents EBITDA minus change in net working capital
and maintenance capital expenditures.

- “Cash Flow Conversion” represents Operating Cash Flow before Taxes divided by EBITDA.

- “Free Cash Flow” represents Operating Cash Flow before Taxes plus taxes paid and
discretionary capital expenditures.

When reviewing performance, the directors use a combination of GAAP measures and Non-GAAP
Measures. We believe that Non-GAAP Measures are a useful indicator of, among other things, our
ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and
other interested parties in evaluating us. Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool,
and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they
do not reflect our capital expenditures or capitalised product development costs, our future
requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in,
or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect the interest expense, or the
cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; (iv) although


-----

depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortised will
often need to be replaced in the future and Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect any cash requirements
that would be required for such replacements, (v) they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges
resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations and (vi) other
companies in our industry may calculate Non-GAAP Measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of such Non-GAAP Measures as comparative measures.

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our Financial Statements or our
accounting records and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants
or experts. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the use or
computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these measures
should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under UK GAAP.

**Last Twelve Months Financial Information**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain unaudited historical financial information for the
Target Group for the twelve months ended 30 September 2021 (the “LTM Period”). The financial
information for the LTM Period reflects an arithmetic calculation generated by adding the unaudited
interim consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2021 extracted from the Interim Financial Statements to the consolidated financial
information of the Target Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 extracted from the Audited
Financial Statements (or the Interim Financial Statements in case of financial information restated
therein) and subtracting the unaudited interim consolidated financial information of the Target Group
for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 extracted from the Interim Financial Statements.
Although the components of the calculation of the financial information for the LTM Period have been
either audited or reviewed, the LTM Period itself is not an accounting period that has been subject to
audit or review by the Target Group’s independent statutory auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. We are
providing historical financial information for the LTM Period for the convenience of investors.
Operational data for the LTM Period has been derived by adding the amounts for the nine-month
period ended 30 September 2021 to the amounts for the year ended 31 December 2020 and
subtracting the amounts for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020.

**Financial Year**

Our financial year begins on 1 January of a given calendar year and ends on 31 December of that
calendar year.

**Rounding, Foreign Currency Translation and Presentation Conventions**

Certain financial information (including percentages) presented in this Offering Memorandum has
been rounded according to established commercial standards. As a result, figures shown as totals in
this Offering Memorandum may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.
Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial data are calculated
using the numerical data in the Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum, as
applicable, and do not use the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

When discussing our financial performance in this Offering Memorandum, the impact of foreign
currency translation is determined by translating amounts for the earlier period at the foreign currency
exchange rate for the later period.

Unless indicated otherwise, all financial information presented in the text and tables in this Offering
Memorandum is shown in millions of pounds (£ millions).

Financial information presented in parentheses denotes the negative of such number presented.
A dash (“–”) signifies that the relevant item is nil or is not applicable, while a zero signifies that the
relevant figure is available but has been rounded to zero.

###### INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

**General**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
market in which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and
forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly
available information, independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants,
including materials provided by a global management consulting company (the “True Potential Due
**Diligence Report”). While the Issuer accepts responsibility for the accurate extraction and**
summarisation of information and data from the True Potential Due Diligence Report, the Issuer has not
independently verified the accuracy of such information and data and the Issuer accepts no further
responsibility in respect thereof.

Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable,
neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or derived
from these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or
completeness or the accuracy or completeness of the assumptions that the providers of the data
reports have made in compiling this data. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and
subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are
based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the
researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions
should be included in the relevant market. Further, the providers of the data reports do not warrant,
represent or guarantee the accuracy and completeness of any information in this Offering
Memorandum, and neither do the providers of the data reports accept any responsibility or liability to
any party who relies on any information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

In considering the industry and market data included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective
investors should note that this information may be subject to significant uncertainty due to differing
definitions of the relevant markets and market segments described. In many cases, there is no readily
available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other
organisations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally
developed data. Consequently, we have made our estimates largely based on internal surveys and
studies. While we believe our estimates to be reliable, they have not been verified by any independent
sources and we cannot assure you that any of our assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our
position in the industry. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the
accuracy of such information.

Certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market position, growth rates and
other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this Offering Memorandum was estimated,
extrapolated or derived based on assumptions we deem reasonable and from our own research,
surveys, studies and experience. In light of the absence of publicly available information on a
significant proportion of participants in the industry, the data on market sizes and projected growth
rates should be viewed with caution. Our internal estimates have not been verified by any independent
sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates can assure you as
to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Such data
involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those
discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains and refers to certain forward-looking statements with respect to
our financial condition, results of operations and business. Forward-looking statements are statements
of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and
involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or


-----

events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements concerning the potential exposure to market risks and
statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, estimates,
forecasts, projections and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or
may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”,
“estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “objectives”, “outlook”, “probably”, “project”, “will”,
“seek”, “target” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating
or financial performance. All of these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and
assumptions made by such entities that, although believed to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain.
Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon any forward-looking statements. There are
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such
forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forwardlooking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not
be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause
our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to:

- conditions or volatility in the global capital markets, the global economy generally and the UK
economy specifically;

- the impact of the intensely competitive industry in which we operate;

- the impact of increasing investor preference in favour of passive products;

- the actual or perceived underperformance of customer assets that we manage;

- the impact of customer contracts that are subject to termination without cause and on short
notice;

- our ability to effectively and efficiently attract, retain and onboard financial advisers and their
clients;

- our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel or key employees;

- the impact of the conduct of our employees, advisers and representatives;

- our exposure to reputational harm;

- the impact of technology interruptions and increased technology costs;

- the impact of a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity
policies, procedures and capabilities;

- the impact of security and privacy breaches of the systems we use to protect personal data;

- our ability to obtain rights to intellectual property and the impact of related litigation;

- our exposure to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses;

- our exposure to operational risks;

- the impact of the failure of outside service providers and vendors to fulfil their obligations;

- the effectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures;

- our ability to make reasonable estimates relating to our accounting policies and methods;

- the impact of litigation, governmental or regulatory investigations and other claims;

- our ability to detect or prevent money laundering and other financial crime activities;


-----

- the impact of examinations by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations;

- the adequacy of our insurance coverage;

- the impact of significant fluctuations in our expenses;

- the impact of price and earnings inflation;

- the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

- our ability to comply with UK regulatory schemes and the impact of changes thereto;

- the impact of changes to the tax rate or introduction of new tax legislation;

- the impact of changes in the regulations of privacy, data protection and security;

- the impact of disputes with customers or regulatory authorities; and

- the other factors discussed in more detail under “Risk Factors”.

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive. We urge you to read this Offering
Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Our Business” for a more complete_
discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement
speaks only as at the date of the particular statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update
or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements referred to in this section and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including
those set forth under “Risk Factors”. In light of these risks, our results could differ materially from the
forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the
consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the
application of U.S. federal tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any consequences to them
under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction, and the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a
price other than the initial issue price in the Offering. For certain tax considerations that may be relevant
to prospective investors, see “Certain Taxation Considerations”.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

We own or have rights to certain trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the
operation of our businesses. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company
appearing in this Offering Memorandum is the property of its respective holder.

**Overview**

True Potential is a fully integrated technology-led wealth manager, serving investors and advisers
across the United Kingdom. Total assets under administration (“AUA”) on our platform as at
30 September 2021 were approximately £18.8 billion, of which £16.5 billion were assets under our
management (“AUM”), which are assets invested in our range of exclusive investment funds. With our
strong heritage in the North East of England, we have expanded, since inception in 2007, to become
one of the fastest growing financial services businesses in the United Kingdom, employing
approximately 380 full-time staff and working with approximately 4,500 financial advisers. We provide
financial advice, investment platform services and portfolio investment solutions to UK retail clients.

Our aim is to revolutionise the way wealth management is delivered. We believe that by using
technology to deliver financial services, we empower financial advisers and their clients to take control
of their futures. By providing what we call “hybrid advice”, blending technology with expert financial
advice, we are able to offer clients the access and support they need 24/7, while ensuring that they
have an adviser to speak to whenever needed.

We are privileged to work with approximately 17% of UK financial advisers and their clients through
either our fully integrated model or through our software offering, meaning we can have a real impact
on how UK households invest their money and save for retirement.

We grow through accelerated adviser recruitment and client and AUM acquisition. We offer certain
advisers seeking capital to fund their growth a loan of 2% of their total assets under management when
they become “Wealth Management Partners”, which is our term for our team of self-employed
restricted advisers who are focused on the investment opportunities on our platform and in our
portfolios. Our recruitment programmes have contributed to rapid growth in our AUM from £6.0 billion
as at 31 December 2018 to £16.5 billion in our own funds as at 30 September 2021.

True Potential is primarily made up of the following businesses:

- True Potential Investments (“TPI”), which provides our purpose-built, in-house proprietary wealth
management platform and our own exclusive investment fund range;

- True Potential Wealth Management (“TPWM”), which is our wealth management advice
proposition with 844 self-employed Wealth Management Partners as well as our 40-member inhouse team of financial advisers and support staff (the “Central Advice Team”);


-----

- True Potential Adviser Services (“TPAS”), which provides technology, adviser support and
compliance services to approximately 598 financial advice firms with approximately 3,600
individual advisers representing more than one million clients; and

- True Potential Administration LLP (“TPA”), which is the in-house authorised corporate director
(“ACD”) for the 34 underlying funds of the True Potential Portfolios (“TPI Funds”).

As a fully integrated wealth manager participating in all parts of the value chain, we service all stages
of the wealth management process. We benefit from synergies across our ecosystem, with our
distribution, investment management and technology capabilities complementing each other. Our fully
integrated ecosystem enables and benefits from a multi-channel distribution model with multiple fee
streams. New investments pass through the True Potential platform and are invested in our ten
exclusively managed risk-weighted investment portfolios (the “True Potential Portfolios”), enabling us
to capture economies across the value chain. Our multiple distribution channels include (i) our wealth
management advice channel TPWM, (ii) our adviser support services channel TPAS and (iii) a
direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) and auto-enrolment pension channel, where clients do not receive
financial advice. Assets that originated via these distribution channels then flow primarily to TPI, where
they are held and managed. Our multiple fee streams in TPI include (i) platform fees, (ii) fund fees and
(iii) performance fees, while TPWM also benefits from financial advice fees and TPAS also generates
revenue from service fees.

Our revenue has become increasingly diversified across channels, resulting in robust AUA and AUM
expansion, supported by a growing recruitment programme that has led to double-digit revenue
growth and margin expansion. From 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, AUA on the True
Potential platform increased by £11.1 billion, or 143.6%, and AUM invested in TPI Funds increased by
£10.6 billion, or 177.3%. Our Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 was
£165.3 million, which was generated from gross revenue of £260.4 million, and our EBITDA was £122.6
million, representing an EBITDA Margin of 74.2% and an EBITDA compound annual growth rate
(“CAGR”) of 67.8% from 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 was £160.0 million.

Gross Asset Inflows grew from £2.2 billion in 2018 to £4.2 billion in 2020 to £4.9 billion in the nine
months ended 30 September 2021. Over recent years, organic growth has been the “traditional” route
for Gross Asset Inflows through adviser and productivity growth and remains a strong underpin. The
majority of Gross Asset Inflows in 2018 and 2019 came from organic channels, most notably through
TPWM, which accounted for approximately 52% in 2018 and approximately 40% in 2019, and TPAS,
which represented approximately 43% in 2018 and 24% in 2019. In recent years, management has
been reinvesting cash flows into various recruitment initiatives, increasing the level of inorganic growth
given the market opportunity.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Fully integrated business model drives capture of top of funnel flows and provides a competitive_**
**_edge_**

We have developed a full suite of capabilities across the value chain, all underpinned by a proprietary,
purpose-built and innovative technology platform that allows us to drive superior financial
performance.

The top of funnel flows are sourced through three distribution channels – (i) our wealth management
advice channel TPWM; (ii) our adviser support services channel TPAS; and (iii) a D2C and autoenrolment pension channel. These assets are held on the True Potential platform and are primarily
invested into TPI Funds held on this platform with a smaller portion of the AUA held in third-party funds.
As a consequence, we have well-diversified revenue attributable to the three distribution channels and
we earn fees across the whole value chain: advice, platform and investment management fees.

Each of our capabilities servicing the wealth management value chain has differentiating attributes,
such as:


-----

- Advice: an at-scale national firm of advisers comprising a team of 844 Wealth Management
Partners and 40 Central Advice Team members, providing advice on True Potential’s investment
proposition.

- Platform: innovative platform seamlessly integrated with advice offering and unified with
investment solutions. The platform has won many awards over the years, most recently the UK
Platform Awards 2021, where True Potential’s platform was voted as the Best Platform Service and
Best Platform Provider.

- Investment solutions: offering competitively priced investment products that provide multi-layered
diversification and attractive risk adjusted returns. Recently, TPI has been named ‘Best for Digital
ISAs’ in the ‘Best Buys 2021 Awards’ by Boring Money.

The proportion of Integrated Flows, calculated as TPI flows divided by total flows, which increased from
89.3% in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 93.0% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September
2021, clearly demonstrates how unique our business model is. Even in absolute terms, Integrated
Flows have increased materially from £2.2 billion in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £6.3 billion
in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021, representing a CAGR of 46.6%. The full
integration of True Potential’s business model allows us to offer clients significantly lower fees than our
main competitors, while maintaining strong profitability. While integrated solutions providers (e.g.
St. James’ Place ISA/Unit Trust and Pension, Quilter PCA and Hargreaves Lansdown), wealth
managers (e.g. Schroders Personal Wealth, Rathbones and Brewin Dolphin) and independent financial
advice firms (i.e. firms representing a typical UK independent financial adviser charging structure and
having more than five advisers) charge all-in fees of approximately 2.3%, 2.3% and 2.0%, respectively,
True Potential charges clients all-in fees of approximately 1.7% of the amount invested.

Our £18.8 billion of AUA, of which 88% is AUM held in TPI Funds, and our network of 844 Wealth
Management Partners give us significant scale to operate in a very competitive market environment.
Additionally, the proprietary purpose-built technology platform operated by True Potential is already
used by approximately 17% of the total UK adviser population. Finally, we are fully licensed as a fund
manager, platform operator, investment manager, and pension operation and administrator (all within
TPI), and for advisory services (within TPWM). These attributes together underpin the significant
differentiation of our unique competitive strength.

**_High-quality, sticky adviser and client relationships drive high levels of recurring revenue_**

The differentiated technology and strong product set we offer have allowed us to attract and retain
productive advisers. This technology proposition offers full-spectrum support to advisers, driving
adviser productivity and satisfaction. Moreover, we leverage strong technology in the recruitment
process as this facilitates fast onboarding and, where required, a seamless asset transfer process.

We have also developed a structured recruitment process and targeted programmes, which allowed
us to rapidly expand our adviser firm from 456 advisers as at 31 December 2018 to 844 as at
30 September 2021, representing cumulative growth of more than 94%.

We have received consistent recognition from our adviser base for our platform quality, service ratings
and value for money propositions. In the Lang Cat Platform Analyser (Adviser Briefing, Issue Three:
June 2020), True Potential ranked:

- #1 for overall platform, achieving an NPS score of 4.48 (compared to the market average of 3.85);

- #1 for service rating, achieving an NPS score of 4.56 (compared to the market average of 3.59);
and

- #3 for value of fees charged, achieving an NPS score of 4.31 (compared to the market average
of 3.90).

The aforementioned high levels of satisfaction amongst advisers translate to sticky end clients,
demonstrated by our AUA retention rate of 97.6% since inception. The highest retention rate is


-----

observed amongst clients who were transferred with advisers hired under our client acquisition and
adviser recruitment programme. Meanwhile, AUA attrition has remained low over the last three years,
standing at 6.6% in the year ended 31 December 2020.

All of the above translate to a continued and sustained growth in Recurring Net Revenue, which
increased from £53 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £97 million in the year ended
31 December 2020, recording a CAGR of 35% and representing 89% of total Net Revenue.

**_Significant growth opportunity underpinned by structural market tailwinds_**

We operate in the fifth largest wealth management market in the world (Source: Global Wealth
Databook 2021), with £500 billion of assets managed by financial advisers in the UK (Source: The Lang
Cat). We have less than 4% market share of the £500 billion advice market, giving us plenty of
headroom to continue growing our business. In 2020, we were the fastest growing company in the
sector, achieving 34% growth in AUA; the next three fastest growing peers achieved assets under
administration growth rates of 32%, 18% and 17%, respectively (Source: Fundscape).

Within the UK wealth management market, we focus on the fastest growing segment of the UK wealth
market, the mass affluent, which includes investors with investable wealth between £100,000 and
£250,000. Given the tailwinds described below, this segment is expected to continue growing faster
than the market average. Moreover, we are positioned to continue benefiting from these trends given
our unwrapped products and hybrid advice model.

_Well-Positioned for Structural Market Growth_

We are well-positioned for tailwinds linked to the number of structural shifts that underpin the UK
wealth management market. According to an internal survey that started in 2013, we estimate that
there is a savings gap of £17,000 between the existing level of savings for retirement and the amount
necessary to generate a desirable income during retirement, and the UK government is expected to
continue adding initiatives that encourage consumers to save more, driving approximately 4% growth
in gross inflows each year. Recent initiatives included increasing tax savings and pension autoenrolment. Demographic trends are also favourable, with 22% of the population aged 65+ in 2030 (vs
18% in 2018), representing a source of sustained growth for us (Source: Office for National Statistics).

_Growth from Adviser Recruitment_

The average age of independent financial advisers in the United Kingdom is 58 years, and one in five
advisers plans to retire in the next five years (Source: The Private Office, 2020). The recruitment
programmes we have developed provide us with a unique edge to capture the assets under
administration from advisers retiring in the near term.

_Regulatory Tailwinds_

In terms of regulatory developments, the sector has seen a transition from defined benefit plans to
defined contribution plans, which shift the investment responsibility to individuals, driving demand for
financial advice. With the end of compulsory annuitisation, members of defined pension schemes are
no longer required to purchase an annuity with their retirement fund but instead have a variety of
options as to how they can access their retirement income. The increase in accessibility from pensions
freedom has given savers in defined contribution schemes greater and earlier access to their cash,
thus allowing them to make investment decisions at an earlier age and with more capital available.
These changes in regulation represent enduring growth opportunities for us.

_Changing Consumer Trends and Preferences_

Furthermore, the FinTech adoption rate in the United Kingdom has increased significantly, going from
14% in 2015 to 86% in 2021 (Source: Plaid), which represents a great opportunity for True Potential to
leverage our proprietary technology platform by providing advisers and clients an enhanced user
experience. The higher adoption of financial technology platforms and other products, as well as the
greater awareness of the importance of saving and investing, are trends that were clearly identified by


-----

-----

Over the years, the True Potential platform has been widely recognised by the market. At the UK
Platform Awards 2021, sponsored by Schroders, we were presented with two awards: Best Platform
Service and Best Platform Provider. In addition, we were named ‘Best for Digital ISAs’ in the ‘Best Buys
2021 Awards’ by Boring Money, as well as the ‘Best Fund Platform’ at the City of London Wealth
Management Awards 2021.

**_Attractive financial profile delivering strong cash flow generation_**

True Potential has demonstrated strong growth in revenue and Net Revenue, with revenue increasing
from £121 million to £185 million and Net Revenue increasing from £58 million to £108 million for the
years ended 31 December 2018 and 2020, respectively, implying a 24% revenue CAGR and a 36% Net
Revenue CAGR over that period. This has been the result of continuously growing our AUA and a
favourable market environment. We were able to grow our AUA from £7.7 billion as at 31 December
2018 to £18.8 billion as at 30 September 2021, implying a 38% CAGR thanks to strong net flows and
adviser recruitment that unlocks client asset acquisitions. Additionally, despite offering lower all-in fees,
our fully integrated model provides a buffer against wider market performance, which is observed by
the 23 percentage points increase in the EBITDA Margin from 51% in the year ended 31 December
2018 to 74% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This trend demonstrates our
operational leverage driven by highly scalable operations and significant investments in the platform.

True Potential’s track record of Cash Flow Conversion has improved over the last few years from 64.7%
in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 93.6% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021.
Despite investing in adviser recruitment and technology and infrastructure, we were able to continue
generating strong cash flows. Finally, our low level of maintenance capital expenditures gives us
flexibility on how to use our cash flow and significant interest coverage.

**_Structural and cultural focus on good customer outcomes_**

True Potential has a strong track record of creating products centred around clients’ needs, while
offering the products at competitive prices. Despite our fully integrated and technologically advanced
offering, we charge all-in fees that are lower than our main competitors. We charge all-in fees of
approximately 1.7% of invested assets, compared to the 2.3%, 2.3% and 2.0% all-in fees charged by
integrated solutions providers, wealth managers and independent financial advice firms, respectively.

With respect to our investment solutions, the ten portfolios offered by TPI are aligned with our ambition
to provide clients with products that match their risk profile. Since inception, these portfolios have
closely matched their benchmark, thus fulfilling their objective of offering important diversification to
clients’ portfolios. Since inception the portfolios have delivered higher returns than those from the
wider UK discretionary management market as measured by certain financial services firms.

When it comes to client engagement, we aim to provide a superior, seamless and primarily digital
journey with minimal manual intervention. Superior customer experience is underpinned both by the
consistency of client service offered through the Central Advice Team and a platform technology
designed to address needs of the end client. The Central Advice Team provides several client services
that differ from the platform, utilising integrated technology and a head office team to book
appointments or provide access to the live chat. Clients are given an online annual suitability review as
well as having unlimited access to a financial adviser and to the feature impulseSave, which enables
clients to top up investments via their app. Through the Central Advice Team, clients are not subject to
any initial fees or drawdown costs, but instead are charged a low ongoing fee. Finally, through our
enhanced digital offering, we empower customers to review their savings and communicate with
advisers to support saving for retirement.

**_Highly credible, visionary management team complemented by robust governance framework_**

We benefit from a well-established governance structure comprised of a highly credible and visionary
management team with a strong track record. Furthermore, our robust risk management and resilient
internal systems contribute to our success.


-----

The five co-founders, Daniel Harrison, David Harrison, Neil Johnson, Mark Henderson and Earl
Glasgow, have each been with us since our inception. The five co-founders have 155 years combined
of experience in the industry. David Harrison has extensive experience in the wealth management
industry, having previously co-founded Positive Solutions, an independent financial advisory firm.
Daniel Harrison previously headed the Group’s marketing and technology teams. Neil Johnson also
serves as the Managing Partner of TPA. Mark Henderson was instrumental in enhancing the True
Potential Wealth Platform’s product range. Earl Glasgow is responsible for the sales activity on the True
Potential Wealth Platform. The senior leadership team also includes two non-executive directors,
George Peebles, who provides oversight on our strategic activities and specialises in M&A, and Peter
Coward, who previously worked as a tax partner at PwC for 27 years. The senior leadership is rounded
out by experienced individuals who have an average of 29 years in the industry and 12 years with us.

**Our Strategies**

We have developed the following strategies to maintain and expand our market-leading positions,
make our businesses more profitable and exploit market opportunities.

**_Continue to focus on adviser recruitment and client asset acquisition_**

We have a strong record in growing our adviser network with the TPWM partner firm having increased
from 456 Wealth Management Partners as at 31 December 2018 to 844 as at 30 September 2021. Our
network of Wealth Management Partners is further complemented by our Central Advice Team of 40
advisers and staff as at 30 September 2021. We have developed a proposition for advisers looking to
monetise their client books and/or raising capital to further grow their client networks. This proposition
is extremely compelling, especially as the transfer of client assets is entirely digitised which leads to a
high conversion rate.

Given our superior technology stack and its consequential impacts on customer experience, we
remain a partner of choice for advisers and clients. There remains a sizable opportunity to target
advisers with our recruitment proposition. We estimate that approximately 24,000, or 87%, of the
approximately 27,500 financial advisers in the United Kingdom are addressable to our recruitment
proposition, with the small firms deemed the easiest to target. As reported by the FCA in July 2021, the
total number of financial advisers in the United Kingdom as at 31 December 2020 was 27,501.
Platforum has reported that 53% of UK financial advisers are in firms with fewer than 50 advisers
(Source: Platforum UK Financial Advisers, November 2020). The smaller firms in the market have seen
increasing regulatory costs and burdens over recent years, via increasing UK Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) levy and additional requirements relating to processing
personally identifiable data; therefore, to run a small advice firm is now particularly challenging. We are
better equipped to target advisers from these smaller firms given that we recruit adviser-by-adviser,
rather than at firm level.

True Potential is targeting further productivity gains through specific initiatives, including:

- _Additional sales initiatives. We use Business Development Managers to target additional sales_
opportunities. By making our digital products – Digital Direct Offer, impulseSave, Client Site
Transfer – available to our advisers, we stand to benefit from additional new money inflows onto
our platform and fund products.

- _Advisers focused on Occupational Pension Transfer (“OPT”) market. It is estimated that the_
current addressable market for defined benefit to defined contribution transfers is £782 billion
(Source: True Potential Due Diligence Report). The OPT process is centrally controlled with the
entire transfer process digitised end-to-end. Given the direct oversight from our head office, the
OPT process allows advisers to focus on the sales process while benefiting from the consistency
of a seamless customer journey and auditable transfer process. True Potential remains
differentiated in its approach with limited competitive threats given its technology advantage.

- _Client Service Transfer (CST) initiative. Advisers have the option to transfer their client business to_
our Central Advice Team. This allows the adviser to use the proceeds from the transfer to focus


-----

on building new client relationships and to pay for client leads to accelerate rebuilding their client
books.

We have an innovative platform that underpins our advice offering. The benefit of having started with
an in-house, purpose-built technology platform from the outset is that we have captured material data
on how our users – both advisers and clients – interact with the technology and the functions they
value. This allows us to make targeted offers on the channel with the highest client engagement
translating to a higher success conversion rate.

**_Further improve operational efficiency_**

True Potential has consistently recorded yearly increases in EBITDA Margin. This metric increased from
51% for the year ended 31 December 2018 to 74% for the twelve-month period ended 30 September
2021. The primary driver of our EBITDA Margin is our fully invested, scalable and proprietary
technology platform.

The core architecture of the platform has been provisioned with significant growth potential. For
example, just in terms of storage we have has contracted for 70 terabytes of private cloud capacity and
are currently at 40 terabytes usage. To complement this, we have contracted for 2,800 gigabyte
storage on the public cloud with only approximately 900 gigabytes currently being used. In the future,
our strategy is to continue migrating from the private cloud to a public cloud, which is offered by
Microsoft Azure – a platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) approach whereby Microsoft manages the ongoing
patching of components. This change will bring us several advantages:

- the ability to focus on developing the components to meet the business needs, instead of
spending too much time on the underlying requirements of infrastructure installations and
maintenance;

- a more flexible cost structure, as we will only pay for what we use, when we use it, and with the
option to turn it off when it is no longer needed; and

- infinite scalability across the globe, as we will not need to project for and purchase expected
infrastructure upfront; we can initiate new projects instantly with the minimum required
infrastructure and scale up as we go.

We expect that the benefits of increasing scale through the business plan are also going to be evident
in the cost of the TPI Funds. The sub-fund managers are on tiered charging structures; as AUM
increases the effective pay away reduces as a result of the tiering. Enhanced scale will also allow us
to negotiate better terms with new sub-advisers we attract to the business.

Management actively reviews the operational set-up of True Potential to unlock cost savings. Two
recent examples include the insourcing of SEI activities and the recent ACD authorisation. SEI
provided the back-office technology and custodianship of the assets on the platform prior to 2018
when TPI built the platform in house. The re-platforming of the assets from the SEI system to the TPI
build system was seamless, which we believe is unprecedented in the platform industry. On the other
hand, Smith and Williamson provided the outsourced ACD function for the TPI fund range prior to the
launch of TPA in 2021.

**_Continue to develop True Potential’s investment solutions_**

Our objective is to deliver investment solutions that offer multi-layered diversification with attractive
risk/reward trade-off at a low cost. There is currently £16.5 billion of AUM in TPI Funds and 93% of total
inflows during the nine-months to 30 September 2021 have been invested in these funds. Since
inception, TPI Funds have delivered strong performance across its range of funds. Delivering the right
outcomes from the range of investment solutions is particularly important and TPI will continue to focus
on sustaining its record of investment outperformance for its customers.

We recently received FCA approval to launch seven new funds, two income funds and five funds
across our current risk categories, adding two new fund managers to our proposition. For the income


-----

portfolios, these managers will provide further diversification to income sources and reduce the current
UK bias. Adding a new manager across our current risk profiles will bring a growth-orientated style
based on their thematic approach to equity selection in our strategies.

TPI, being an integral part of True Potential, provides distinct advantages and allows for close
integration and collaboration across the group. In the future, we expect to develop additional products
to directly meet the needs of customers, including those focused on sustainability.

**_Continue to invest in data and analytics_**

We use technology to ensure end clients have the best possible experience whilst also allowing us to
bulk service clients without significantly growing our teams. Our ability to enable and transition clients
to a state of comfort in managing their own financial affairs online or within the app is key to achieving
this objective. A clear example of our success in this initiative comes from the Central Advice Team,
where we have approximately 30,400 clients serviced by 40 people. Furthermore, we can see a
growing trend in the numbers of client log-ins and returning client log-ins from Central Advice Team
clients and, specifically, clients tend to log-in ten times per month on the app and four times per month
on the web.

Client engagement has always been a key aspect in our business model because the most engaged
clients generally have more assets on our platform. For instance, the Central Advice Team clients
categorised as “Super Engaged” have, on average, assets with £328,000 invested with us, compared
to “Not Engaged” clients worth £93,000 and “Not Activated” clients with £48,000.

As a higher level of client engagement is associated with larger average portfolios, we have been
developing several initiatives with the ultimate goal of improving the engagement level with our clients.
True Potential introduced the next instance of the client facing suite, cNext, in January 2022. This
upgrade is the next level of evolution for True Potential’s client portal which will embed enhanced
analytics and machine learning to identify and customise client-relevant information and product
marketing.

As part of cNext, we have also laid the foundational client-visible features to enable improved
personalisation and hyper-personalisation going forward. The prior current client site had standardised
videos, blogs and articles for clients. In the new instance, these feeds are tailored to respective client
profiles and individual client circumstances and events building on insights gathered from the wealth
of personal information gathered within a standard factfind along with portfolio events, behaviour and
browsing history on the website and app. We also improved our capabilities to send tailored content
and push notifications on the web and our mobile app and enhanced our already available (via the
web) video chat to also be directly available within our mobile apps with no requirement for additional
third-party component installations (such as Zoom). Additionally, we are increasingly integrating open
banking features within our client site. This allows clients to aggregate their bank accounts and offplatform investments on a single view alongside their True Potential investments, in addition to allowing
the clients the ability to visualise their current spending habits and set budgeting targets for the future.
We are also offering rewards to clients as an additional pull feature. Engagement behaviour is useful
for us to improve targeted marketing by allowing relevant product information to be made available in
real time, which translates to a higher success rate. The key objective of these features is to encourage
the end client to self-service, but in doing so data is generated, tracked and analysed by us. We have
a deep data lake of approximately 40 terabytes developed over a span of 14 years that can be
leveraged to hyper-personalise and better service existing clients and enhance cross-selling.

In order to further leverage our well-established back-end system, we continue enhancing our backend data architecture and infrastructure with the development of our client analytics infrastructure and
cube. Client analytics is key to enabling the ease at which data are ingested from the various facets of
the True Potential system and denormalised from data into information that can be easily interrogated
by data analysts with a view to further understand clients, personalise our engagement with each
individual on a bulk scale and predict and influence their behaviour in future. Some advantages
coming from our improvements are: easily and automatically identifying and acting upon opportunities


-----

within the client bank; better predicting client behaviour based on categorisation and clustering; and
hyper-personalising the engagement with and experience of the end client. A final key component of
our strategy is bringing this engagement information back into the vNext system, so that if a client does
need to speak to us, we have an unrivalled visual of the client history and behaviour immediately
visible, thereby ensuring that the end client gets the best possible support.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On 8 September 2021, the Issuer entered into a sale and purchase deed (the “Acquisition
**Agreement”) for the purchase from the persons named therein as senior partners (the “Senior**
**Partners”), the persons named therein as other shareholders (the “Other Shareholders”) and FTV-**
True, LLC (“FTV”, and, together with the Senior Partners and the Other Shareholders, in their capacity
as sellers under the Acquisition Agreement, the “Sellers”) of all of the issued and outstanding share
capital (the “Shares”) of the Target (the “Acquisition”). Completion of the Acquisition (“Completion”,
and such date, the “Completion Date”) took place on 21 January 2022 following the satisfaction of
certain regulatory conditions, including approval by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) of
the Issuer’s acquisition of control over the FCA-authorised subsidiaries of the Target. Pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer acquired the Shares for approximately £1,808.7 million (the
“Purchase Price”).

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Cinven Funds indirectly acquired a majority stake in the
Target Group through intermediate holding companies, including Kane Feederco Limited, Kane Topco
Limited, the Parent and the Issuer. On Completion, the Cinven Funds acquired beneficial ownership of
a majority stake of 68.7%, with the Sellers reinvesting a portion of the sale proceeds and retaining a
31.3% minority interest.

**_The Financing_**

The Acquisition was financed as follows:

- the Cinven Funds and the Sellers contributed £1,795.2 million, directly or indirectly, by way of
equity (the “Equity Contribution”), of which £1,232.6 million was contributed by the Cinven
Funds and £562.6 million was equity reinvested by the Sellers; and

- the Issuer entered into a bridge facility agreement on 19 January 2022 (the “Bridge Facility
**Agreement”), which provides for term borrowings of £675.0 million (the “Bridge Facility”) and**
drew the full amount of available borrowings.


-----

In addition, the Issuer entered into a revolving credit facility agreement on 19 January 2022 (the
“Revolving Facility Agreement”), which provides for multi-currency borrowings of £100.0 million (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in an amount of £50.0 million on
the Completion Date, providing the Target with cash for working capital liquidity.

The Equity Contribution, the full amounts drawn under the Bridge Facility and the amount drawn under
the Revolving Credit Facility were used to: (i) pay the Purchase Price for the Acquisition; (ii) repay in
full and cancel the existing indebtedness of the Target in an amount of approximately £615.0 million;
(iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein) in an amount of
£45.1 million; and (iv) fund the Issuer’s balance sheet with £52.4 million.

The above financings are collectively referred to herein as the “Financing”. The proceeds from the
Offering will be used to repay and cancel the Bridge Facility (the “Refinancing”).

The Financing, the Acquisition, the repayment and cancellation of the existing indebtedness of the
Target and the Refinancing are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions”. See “Use of
_Proceeds”._

future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly


-----

subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including
the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any);

               - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to the Notes;

               - not be guaranteed by any Subsidiary (as defined in
“Description of the Notes”) or parent of the Issuer;

               - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future
Indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade
creditors) of the Issuer that is secured by property and
assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness; and

               - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
Indebtedness of Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of
_the Notes”) of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes._

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) be secured by limited recourse third-party security
over the Parent’s shares in the Issuer and any structural
intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Issuer (the
“Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 30 days after the Completion Date, the Notes will (subject
to the Agreed Security Principles) also be secured by the
Issuer’s material bank accounts, its shares in the Target and any
structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by the
Target (the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and, together
with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will also secure the obligations of the Issuer under
the Revolving Credit Facility. In the event of enforcement of the
Collateral, Holders will receive proceeds from such Collateral
only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have been
repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Notes and
_Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and_
_counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future_
_indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit_
_Facility that is permitted to be incurred under the terms of the_
_Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will be entitled to be_
_repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in_
_priority over the Notes”._

The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by
applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit their
validity and enforceability. In addition, the security interests in
the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances.
Subject to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. For
more information on the security interests granted, see
“Description of the Notes—Security”. For more information on
potential limitations to the security interests, see “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain_

respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes or other governmental charges in any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the

law. If withholding or deduction is required by law, the Issuer will
pay additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no
less than that which you would have received in the absence of
such withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions.
See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other

that the application to the Authority to list the Notes on the
Official List will be approved or that permission to deal in the

###### SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

_The following tables set forth summary historical financial information and summary unaudited interim_
_financial information of the Target Group for the periods and dates indicated. The Issuer was formed as_
_a private limited company under the laws of Jersey on 27 August 2021 for purposes of facilitating the_
_Transactions. Consequently, no historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available. The_
_Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the Transactions._
_The only material assets and liabilities of the Issuer (other than with respect to the Financing) are those_
_of the Target Group. Going forward, our financial statements will be consolidated at the level of the_
_Issuer as will be required under the Indenture._

_The summary historical financial data as of 30 September 2021 and for the nine-month periods ended_
_30 September 2020 and 2021 have been derived from the Interim Financial Statements. The Interim_
_Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards,_
_including Financial Reporting Standard 104, “The Financial Reporting Standard” applicable in the_
_United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006 and, in the opinion of the management, include all_
_adjustments necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. The historical financial data_
_included in this Offering Memorandum as of and for the years ended 31 December 2018, 2019 and_
_2020 have been derived from the Audited Financial Statements. The Audited Financial Statements have_
_been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. The results of operations for prior years are not necessarily_
_indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Interim financial results are not necessarily_
_indicative of results for the full fiscal year or any future reporting period._

_The summary unaudited financial data for the Target Group for the twelve-month period ended_
_30 September 2021 have been derived by adding the unaudited interim consolidated financial_
_information of the Target Group for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 to the_
_consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 and then_
_subtracting the interim consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the nine-month period_
_ended 30 September 2020. The summary unaudited financial data for the Target Group for the_
_twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and_
_are not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial_
_condition at any future date._

_We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted financial data of the Issuer,_
_which are based on the consolidated financial information of the Target Group, as adjusted to give pro_
_forma effect to (i) the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on either 1 October 2020 (for_
_purposes of unaudited adjusted financial data derived from the Target Group’s consolidated results of_
_operations) or 30 September 2021, for purposes of unaudited adjusted financial data derived from the_
_Target Group’s consolidated balance sheet or (ii) the Offering as if the sale of the Notes had occurred_
_on 1 October 2020. The unaudited adjusted financial data is for informational purposes only and are not_
_intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position_
_that we would have reported had the Transactions or the Offering been completed on 1 October 2020,_
_30 September 2021 or any other date and should not be taken as indicative of our future consolidated_
_results of operations or financial position following consummation of the Transactions and the Offering._
_The unaudited adjusted financial data have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of_
_Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any_
_generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma_
_adjustments nor the resulting unaudited adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed in_
_accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards._

_The financial data below also includes certain non-GAAP measures used to evaluate our economic and_
_financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures pursuant to UK_
_GAAP, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards and therefore should not be considered_
_as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information—Non-GAAP Measures”._

(5)  Integrated Flows represents the percentage of Gross Asset Inflows that were invested in TPI Funds during the period.

(6)  Client AUA Churn represents AUA outflows during the period as a percentage of average AUA for the period. For purposes
of the calculation of Client AUA Churn, average AUA amounts are calculated by adding the month-open AUA for each month
in the period and dividing by the number of months in the period as set out in the table below.

The table below shows the percentage point split of AUA lost by cause, being either regular business (i.e. client income
drawdowns) or transfers and closures (i.e. clients withdrawing their funds in order to close their account). In addition,
because client funds are fully invested, a percentage of assets is periodically sold in order to provide the funds to pay fees.
Such amounts, which have not historically been tracked as a component of AUA Churn, equalled 1.1% of average AUA for
the twelve months ended 30 September 2021. Client AUA Churn for the nine-month periods ended 30 September 2020 and
2021 is annualised.

###### RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the Notes entails risks. There are a number of factors, including those specified below,_
_that may adversely affect our ability to make payments under the Notes. You could therefore lose a_
_substantial portion or all of your investment in the Notes. Consequently, an investment in the Notes_
_should be considered only by persons who can assume such risk. You should note that the risks_
_described below are not the only risks that we face. The risks described below are all of the risks we_
_consider to be material. However, there may be additional risks that we currently consider immaterial or_
_of which we are currently unaware, and any of these risks could have the effects set forth above. Our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected_
_by any of these risks. When the terms “we”, “us” and “our” are used in this section, (i) when referring_
_to operations, businesses, market shares or historical financial results, such terms refer to the Target_
_and its subsidiaries, (ii) when referring to the Financing and pro forma indebtedness obligations, such_
_terms refer to the Issuer and (iii) when referring to the Transactions, such terms refer to one or more of_
_the Issuer and the Parent._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Difficult macroeconomic conditions could lead to asset price declines or volatility which may_**
**_adversely affect the market value of our AUA and AUM, which in turn could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

A deterioration in global capital markets, the global economy generally and the UK economy may
adversely affect our results because we derive a significant portion of our income from fees, which are
calculated as a percentage of AUA or AUM. We are directly exposed to changes in both equity markets
and fixed income markets, through the value of AUA or AUM. Our AUA and our AUM have increased
from £7.7 billion and £6.0 billion, respectively, as at 31 December 2018 to £18.8 billion and
£16.5 billion, respectively, as at 30 September 2021. These increases have largely been responsible
for our rapid turnover and EBITDA growth over this time period. If our AUA or AUM were to decrease
as result of adverse market conditions, our turnover and EBITDA could see slower growth or even
decline.

Factors that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on global capital markets
include political or regulatory change or uncertainty, supply chain difficulties, energy price volatility,
natural disasters, impacts of climate change, terrorist incidents, rising inflationary concerns, labour
market tightening, concerns over low levels of growth in developed and emerging economies and
corporate profits, rapid rises and falls in currency exchange rates, high levels of sovereign debt,
changes in inflation expectations and long-term low, negative or increasing interest rates and bond
yields. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of the Delta,
Omicron and potential other variants, may also adversely affect the global economy. The immigration,
trade and tax policies of the United Kingdom, Europe or the United States could also lead to major
changes in global trade flows, which could have a material impact on the global economy or could
lead to volatility and a decline in capital markets or particular asset classes, which might reduce the
demand for or value of investment assets.

In recent years, steady economic growth accompanied with a loose monetary policy has generally
resulted in low volatility across financial markets. However, this combination could change, and robust
performance in financial markets, particularly equity markets, is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Initially
to support recovery after the global financial crisis, and more recently in 2020 to support the global
economy during the lockdowns and restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
quantitative easing measures implemented by record low interest rates or the purchase of government
debt set by central banks (e.g. the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal
Reserve) have helped loosen financial conditions and decrease borrowing costs, and these measures
may have led to the emergence of asset and liquidity bubbles that could be susceptible to rapid price
corrections as financial conditions tighten, including in the stock, bond and property markets. As a
result, these measures may directly decrease the investment returns on our products and portfolios,
thereby reducing our fee income. The withdrawal of accommodative policies may cause losses to


-----

investors and raise the risk of default on fixed income securities, including those in assets we manage.
Higher interest rates may make investing in our investment products less attractive than alternative
investment opportunities.

The True Potential Portfolios we manage include a range of assets that are denominated in foreign
currencies, including foreign equities and bonds. Some of this foreign currency exposure is hedged,
but the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on these assets could nevertheless lead to fluctuations in
the amount of fee income generated.

Furthermore, although a significant portion of the assets we manage come from pensions and
Individual Savings Accounts (“ISAs”), where flows are less sensitive to market fluctuations, in very
severe market conditions we may also experience an indirect impact on AUA and AUM through the
redemption of products by clients or lower sales figures. These adverse changes would impact the
stock of AUA and AUM and thus affect earnings negatively and potentially have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We operate in an intensely competitive industry. Competitive pressures may result in a loss of_**
**_clients and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, thereby reducing_**
**_our revenue and EBITDA._**

We are subject to competition in our business from other integrated solutions providers, wealth
managers and independent financial adviser firms, such as Aviva Wrap, Fidelity, Praemium, Prudential,
Quilter, Royal London, Standard Life Elevate, Standard Life Wrap, St James’s Place and Transact.
Some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range
of financial products across more markets. We compete with other providers of investment advisory
services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered,
investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice
and other client services. Some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that
make it more difficult for us to compete with them in certain circumstances. Substantially all of our
investment products are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may
be more willing to transfer assets to competing products, leading to decreases in revenue and EBITDA.

In the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response
to competitive pressures, which we have done selectively in the past, revenue and operating margins
could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Increasing investor preference in favour of passive products may result in a loss of our market_**
**_share, which could lead to a reduction in our revenue and EBITDA._**

While investment markets have generally experienced sustained growth in recent years, many active
funds have not performed as well as passive investments, which has led some UK investors to
increasingly focus on fees and related expenses and in turn favour lower fee passive investment
products. As a consequence, passive funds constituted 31% of assets under management in the
United Kingdom in 2020 and are likely to grow further, compared to 26% of assets under management
in 2017 (Source: The Investment Association, September 2021 and September 2018). Moreover, the
increasing adoption of technology and the growth of digital advisers have further driven the demand
for passive investment products. This is expected to lead to lower levels of fees in the asset
management industry and could possibly result in the consolidation of smaller players as scale
becomes increasingly important. Moreover, investment managers who place a greater focus on
cost-efficient passive products are gaining market share. However, this migration to passive investing
is occurring at a slower rate in the retail wealth compared to the institutional investor pools and is
favoured by the younger investors who have a far lower level of assets under management than the
older investors who are less inclined to switch to passive investing. While we believe there will continue
to be demand in the United Kingdom for strong performing active management at attractive pricing,
we cannot predict how much market share competitors offering passive investment products will gain.
The loss of market share in the United Kingdom to these competitors could adversely affect our


-----

revenue and operating margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Underperformance, whether actual or perceived, of customer assets relating to our products,_**
**_solutions or funds under our management could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

A substantial portion of our business involves the provision of advice-led wealth solutions (through
TPWM) and the management of multi-asset solutions and investment portfolios (through TPWM, TPI
and TPAS). As a result, a key factor in our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and our
network of advisers is the investment performance of the customer assets that we manage. Currently,
we offer our customers the opportunity to invest in 34 True Potential exclusive funds across ten
portfolios. Any sustained period of actual or perceived underperformance of the products, solutions or
portfolios we deliver, whether as compared to peers, customer expectations, benchmarks (as indicated
by the likes of Morningstar, for example) or internal targets, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

When financial advisers select investment products or when customers select a wealth manager, one
of the key considerations is the historical investment performance of the products or solutions offered.
If we were to fail to provide satisfactory investment returns in our managed portfolios or wealth
management solutions, customers of such solutions (or customers generally) may choose to decrease
their investments with us or withdraw assets altogether in favour of better-performing services or
competing investment managers, which would lead to a direct reduction in the level of our AUA and
AUM and, as a result, lower fee income.

Investment underperformance as compared to competitors, customer or adviser expectations or
relevant benchmarks would also make it more difficult for us to attract new customers and advisers
and could damage our reputation and brands, which have in part been built around our investment
performance generally. As a result, our ability to attract assets from existing and new customers and
advisers might diminish, particularly given the competitive nature of the wealth management market.
Independent and restricted financial advisers and other intermediaries, who typically play a substantial
role in referring new customers to us and distributing our products, may reduce or cease
recommending some or all of our products to their customers, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_A majority of our revenue is based on customer contracts that are subject to termination without_**
**_cause and on short notice._**

Our revenue is predominantly derived from fund and platform fees, which are typically calculated as a
percentage of the market value of the value of our AUA and AUM. A high proportion of our wealth
management products permit our customers to reduce the aggregate amount of their investment with
little or no notice, or to withdraw altogether from such portfolios or contracts. If interest rates rise, equity
markets or fixed income markets decline or our investment performance underperforms, the rate of
redemptions and withdrawals could accelerate. Furthermore, changes in investing trends, particularly
investor preference for passive or alternative investment products, and in retirement savings trends,
may reduce interest in our products and may alter our mix of AUA or AUM. A substantial or systemic
withdrawal of AUA or AUM could result in lower platform fees and therefore revenue and, depending
on the extent of such withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Failure to effectively and efficiently attract, retain and onboard financial advisers and their clients_**
**_may materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business._**

The primary growth channel for our business is through accelerated recruitment of restricted financial
advisers, through which we sell and distribute our products and solutions. We depend on our ability to
continually attract, train and retain high-calibre advisers under our recruitment programme in a
competitive market. As at 30 September 2021, we had a total of 844 advisers in TPWM, comprising
approximately 17% of the total market of financial advisers in the United Kingdom. The number of

restricted financial advisers in TPWM has grown from 456 as at 31 December 2018 to 844 as at
30 September 2021. If we are unable to continue to grow our number of advisers, either as a result of
factors outside of our control (such as consolidation of our competitors leading to benefits from
economies of scale) or factors within our control (such as failure to offer competitive rewards and
compensations or to maintain a positive reputation), we may fail to achieve our strategic objectives or
achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified personnel or key_**
**_employees._**

Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contribution of our board of
directors, key senior management and technical, financial and operations personnel. Management of
our growth will require, among other things, stringent control of financial systems and operations, the
continued development of our management control, the ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers
of qualified management and other personnel, the continued training of such personnel, sufficient
internal succession planning for key roles and the presence of adequate supervision. The personal
connections and relationships of our board of directors and key management are important to the
conduct of our business. If we were to unexpectedly lose a member of our key management team, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely
affected.

In particular, the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully adapt to rapidly
changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments. This necessitates a range of
specialist personnel, particularly in the areas of compliance and risk, technical support, finance and
controls, sales, administration and operations, and requires us to retain, recruit and develop the
necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our business
and operations. The market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting
additional personnel, or we may fail to replace departing personnel with suitable successors. There
may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in this position and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to identify or employ qualified internal or external candidates within a
reasonable timeframe. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in additional
expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot guarantee that key personnel,
including executive officers, will remain in our employment or that we will be able to attract and retain
qualified personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are exposed to risks arising from the conduct of our employees, advisers and representatives._**

Our decisions and behaviour, and those of our 844 self-employed restricted advisers who are focused
on the investment opportunities on True Potential’s platform and in its portfolios (the “Wealth
**Management Partners”), if they do not align with the principles governing our business, may lead to**
unfair treatment of our customers or otherwise result in unfavourable customer outcomes. Conduct risk
may arise where we or our Wealth Management Partners fail to design, implement or adhere to
appropriate policies and procedures, offer products, services or other propositions that do not meet
the needs of customers or fail to perform in accordance with their respective intended design, fail to
communicate properly with customers, fail to deal with complaints effectively, sell or recommend
unsuitable products or solutions to our customers, fail to provide them with sufficient information to
make informed decisions or provide inappropriate investment or financial planning advice to
customers, or fail to do any of the foregoing on a continuing basis after initial sales, among other
things.

Conduct risk remains the subject of close regulatory scrutiny. Given that regulation includes
principles-based rules and regulations, the rules and regulations may be subject to differing
applications and interpretations by regulators or market participants over time. Failing to protect the
interests of customers in this way and failing to demonstrate adequate suitability processes and
monitoring could lead to legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions. Furthermore, regulators


-----

may deem certain of our advisers’ customers to be “vulnerable” customers, which the FCA has defined
as someone who, owing to their personal circumstances, is particularly susceptible to detriment,
especially when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care. This finding may result in a higher
standard of conduct being required of us in relation to products and services offered to such
customers. Potential legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions could in turn lead to financial
penalties, reputational damage and, in the case of regulatory enforcement action, the suspension or
revocation of regulatory permissions, licenses or approvals. Moreover, if we fail to detect misconduct
on a timely basis, or at all, we may face additional reputational or financial damage, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our occupational pension transfer distribution channel is subject to higher regulatory and market
standards around suitability of advice. For instance, clients onboarded through occupational pension
transfers undergo a robust compliance process where client information is obtained and analysed
before a presentation is made to the client. The pension is then subject to continuous internal and
external compliance monitoring, including internal suitability file checks, expert P2P check and SMF16
checks. We are confident that we will continue to provide suitable advice which is fully compliant with
all FCA rules and guidance, as evidenced in November 2019 following a two-day visit from the FCA
that showed no material concerns over our occupational pension transfer business. However, any
failure to maintain our compliance could lead to financial penalties, reputational damage and the
suspension or revocation of regulatory permissions, licenses or approvals, which in turn could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to decreases in revenue and_**
**_EBITDA._**

We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance and
superior client service. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of
threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly, or even impossible, to remediate.
Regulatory inquiries and rumours can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those
inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. Actual or perceived failure to adequately address the
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to
a tarnished reputation and loss of customers. While we maintain policies, procedures and controls to
reduce the likelihood of unauthorised activities, we are subject to the risk that our associates or third
parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies
and procedures. Real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own, as well as any
fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information, may impair our reputation and
subject us to litigation or regulatory action. Any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract
and retain clients and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, and
in turn our revenue and EBITDA, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our business performance is underpinned by our technology and our operations could suffer_**
**_from technology interruptions, increased technology costs and an inability to successfully_**
**_anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry._**

The success of our business depends in large part on our information technology infrastructure and
software systems. We must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to
access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our business activities. Our capacity to execute
and process transactions and provide end-customers with a seamless and effective service depends
on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage significant quantities of data on a continuous
basis. Accordingly, interruptions to or loss of our information processing capabilities through the loss
of stored data, computer equipment or software systems failure, telecommunications failure or other
disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. Such disruptions could be caused by, among other things, terrorist
activities, computer viruses, third-party attacks, disease or pandemics. Any security or privacy breach
of these databases could also expose us to liability, cause us to incur expenses relating to the


-----

resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation and deter intermediaries and customers from
dealing with us. Although we maintain, and regularly assess the adequacy of, a disaster recovery plan
designed to effectively manage the effects of such unforeseen events, we cannot be certain that any
recovery plan will function as intended. A failure or inadequacy of our disaster recovery plan may have
a material adverse effect on our ability to support and service our customer base.

Additionally, information technology evolves rapidly and is characterised by short product life cycles.
We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adapting to technological changes on a timely
basis, which could allow our competitors to serve customers more effectively. Although we seek to
upgrade our information technology hardware infrastructure on a regular basis, there can be no
assurance that our information technology infrastructure and software systems will continue to be
adequate for our business. For example, we could face risks associated with the release of a new
operating system that is vulnerable to cyberattacks, our capacity for storing data if we take on
numerous clients without preparing the necessary storage, or with the publication of a webpage that
could be exploited. While we believe that our existing information technology infrastructure and
software systems are sufficient to meet our current demands, our future growth may require additional
investment in these systems. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new
technologies to successfully offer our advances and process payments. We cannot assure you that
adequate capital resources will be available to us when we need to make such investments, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_A cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies,_**
**_procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses._**

We depend on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and
capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data. An externally caused information security
incident, such as a cyberattack, a phishing scam, virus, ransomware attack, denial-of-service attack,
or an attack launched from within our organisation, could materially interrupt business operations or
cause disclosure or modification of confidential client or competitive information.

There have been increasing numbers of publicised cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting
other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries. Our use of third-party vendors and
cloud technologies could heighten this risk. Should the technology operations on which we rely be
compromised, we may have to make significant investments to upgrade, repair or replace our
technology infrastructure or third-party vendors and may not be able to make such investments on a
timely basis. Although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and
adequate for the purpose of our business, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and
costs stemming from breaches of security, cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any
resulting disruptions from such events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may experience security and privacy breaches of the systems we use to protect personal_**
**_data._**

Our databases contain personal data of our customers. This data includes information such as name
and date of birth, location information, banking information, credit history and other information that
may be considered personal or confidential. Our databases are vulnerable to interference by
individuals external to our business and by our own employees and service providers, and any misuse
could include fraud and identity theft as well as human error and accidental user activity. Despite the
security measures we have implemented to prevent unauthorised access to information stored in our
database, our systems may fail to adequately protect against physical or electronic break-ins,
computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.


-----

**_Our business may suffer if we are sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of third_**
**_parties, or if we are unable to obtain rights to third-party intellectual property on which our_**
**_business depends. We may not be able to defend our intellectual property rights against third_**
**_parties._**

Product development and differentiation in our industry requires the use of intellectual property rights,
particularly trademarks, licenses and trade secrets. In particular, we rely on a purpose-built proprietary
technology platform to deliver our products and services to our advisers and clients. We have not
historically sought to protect our intellectual property rights by obtaining patent protection, as our
platform would be extremely difficult to replicate. These proprietary rights are important to our business
and our ability to compete effectively with other market participants. We also rely upon trade secrets,
know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing rights to develop, maintain and
strengthen our competitive position. Third parties may in the future assert claims that our systems,
services or products infringe their proprietary rights. Such infringement claims, even if without merit,
may cause us to incur significant costs in defending against those claims. We may be required to
discontinue using any infringing technology or services, pay damages or royalty fees, expend
resources to develop non-infringing technology, dedicate significant financial and management
resources to defend these claims, or purchase licenses or pay royalties for alternative technology.

We may initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets and know-how or determine the enforceability,
scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive,
time-consuming and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. In addition, we may
not prevail in lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
commercially valuable. In addition, any successful infringement proceedings may be economically
worthless for us if they take too much time and the intellectual property right, or the product developed
on the basis of it, becomes obsolete. Any such failure to protect our intellectual property could diminish
our competitive advantage and cause us to lose customers to competitors, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for_**
**_client losses._**

Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as
recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment
restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations and required distributions to
fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our
services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in
reputational damage, liability to clients, the termination of investment management or administration
agreements and/or the withdrawal of assets under our management. For example, in connection with
the production of the quantitative models that we use to support investment decisions and processes,
including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and
product valuations, we use Morningstar as a provider of capital market assumptions, such as expected
return, volatility and asset class correlations. Errors in the design, function or underlying assumptions
used in these models and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period,
could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole
payments, litigation and/or regulatory fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

On 23 October 2020, the FCA authorised our subsidiary, True Potential Administration LLP, to operate
as an internal authorised corporate director, or “ACD”, for the TPI Funds. Prior to this, we retained the
services of a third-party to provide certain investment management services separate from our
administration and management of the True Potential Portfolios ACDs are responsible for ensuring that
funds, such as the 34 exclusive funds we offer, operate within the rules and regulations of the FCA and
are run in the best interests of investors. However, if our internal ACD is unable to ensure that we are
operating within the FCA rules and regulations, we could be subject to financial penalties, reputational
damage and the suspension or revocation of regulatory permissions, licenses or approvals, which in


-----

turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects.

The role of authorised fund managers (“AFMs”) in our industry is currently subject to substantial
scrutiny. The FCA launched a review into AFMs (including ACDs) and released a report in June 2021
outlining weaknesses it discovered in the way in which AFMs operated, including (i) how well AFMs
understand their responsibilities for the funds they operate; (ii) whether these firms had adequate
controls, governance and resources to carry out their role; (iii) how effectively the AFM firms
considered their regulatory responsibilities, primarily under the Collective Investment Scheme
Sourcebook (COLL); (iv) how their oversight of delegated third-party investment managers considered
the interests of fund investors; and (v) whether they had appropriate resources for the nature and scale
of the business they carried out. The FCA expects all AFMs to consider the lessons in this summary
and how they should be applied to the way the AFMs conduct their business. While the primary focus
of the review was AFMs managing UK UCITS funds through a host model, all AFMs managing
authorised funds should also consider the implications for their business. While the FCA’s
observations are focused on conflicts and issues that arose in a host model, there are also useful
lessons for firms operating within a group structure. Our operating model was designed and
established with these lessons in mind. However, we are actively monitoring and managing resources
as the business grows. For example, we intend to appoint a third independent non-executive director
in 2022. If we are unable to continue to keep these lessons in mind as we grow, we could be subject
to review by the FCA, which could lead to financial penalties, reputational damage and the suspension
or revocation of regulatory permissions, licenses or approvals, which in turn could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_We are subject to operational risks, including the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from_**
**_insufficient or failed internal and external processes, poor data handling, systems and human_**
**_error or from external events._**

We rely on our ability to manage a range of internal and external processes, systems and data,
including, for example: (i) platform administration and reporting services to advisers; (ii) processing
and reporting on a substantial number of transactions across numerous and varied products;
(iii) management of customer policies and assets; (iv) maintenance of the integrity of a significant
volume of data; and (v) compliance with relevant regulatory reporting requirements. Furthermore, the
long-term nature of our businesses means that accurate records must be maintained for substantial
periods.

We cannot predict or anticipate the specifics or timing of all possible operational and systems failures
that may negatively impact our business. The systems and processes on which we depend to serve
customers and advisers may fail due to IT malfunctions, business interruptions, intentional
interference, human error, non-performance by third parties or other external events. If systematic or
human errors or failed internal or external processes were to occur with respect to any of the foregoing
or similar risks, this could disrupt business operations, resulting in material brand and reputational
damage, regulatory action, and loss of customers or advisers, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may also
be required to conduct detailed investigations of the circumstances surrounding the breach and
regulatory investigations may also follow. The costs involved in such investigations, including
management’s time and professional fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_If our outside service providers and vendors are unable to or do not fulfil their obligations, our_**
**_operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed._**

We depend on a number of service providers and vendors such as telecommunication companies,
software engineers, data processors, software and hardware vendors and providers of credit score
algorithms who are critical to our operations. These providers include Microsoft Azure, Pulsant and
Morningstar, among others. Although we have implemented agreements and have established
monitoring controls for these service providers and vendors, our operations could be disrupted if we


-----

do not successfully manage relationships with them, if they do not perform or are unable to perform
their obligations, or if they are unwilling to make their services or products available to us at reasonable
prices, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. Additionally, if we are forced to switch service providers or vendors, we cannot assure
you that we would be able to contract with a suitable replacement, or that the prices set by the new
service provider or vendor would be in line with current pricing.

In addition, we depend on banking systems to execute payment transactions in connection with our
business. A systematic shutdown or any other disruption of the banking industry or one of the banks
we work with would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of customers. Any of the foregoing
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
or prospects.

**_Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk_**
**_exposure._**

Our business activities expose us to a wide variety of risks, including credit risk (including execution
settlement risk and overdraft settlement risk), liquidity risk, market risk (including market price risk,
foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), operational risk (including IT risk and legal/compliance
risk) and reputational risk. For many of these risks we have established risk management policies,
some of which are set by or require approval from regulatory bodies. However, our strategies and
procedures for managing such risks may prove insufficient or fail.

Some of our methods for managing risk are based on observations of historical market behaviour and
we apply statistical techniques to observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures. For
instance, we have limited exposure to credit risk as all of our accounts receivable are converted into
cash within a short period of time, with the exception of the adviser loan payments where recoverability
is monitored closely. However, these methods may not comply with regulations or accurately quantify
our risk exposures, especially in situations that do not have historical precedent. If our policies and
procedures are not fully effective or if we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we
are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory
actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects.

**_Our accounting policies and methods are critical to how we report our financial condition and_**
**_results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are often_**
**_uncertain._**

Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition
and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of
these accounting policies and methods so that they comply with generally accepted accounting
practices in the United Kingdom. Our financial accounts carry an inherent reliance on management’s
judgment. We have identified certain accounting policies in the notes to the Financial Statements in
respect of which significant judgment is required in determining appropriate assumptions and
estimates when valuing assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. These are primarily related
to accounting for the accrual of performances fees, the fair value of our investments and the
recognition and useful life of intangibles. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time
based on changes in accounting policies or changes in our business mix. There is a risk that the
judgments exercised by our management team are erroneous and this could lead to inaccuracies in
the reported financial position and performance of our business.

We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these
judgments and the associated assumptions and estimates are well informed and applied consistently
and to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. However,
because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters,
we may be required to make changes in accounting estimates or restate prior period financial


-----

statements in the future, and any such changes or restatements could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation, governmental or regulatory investigations and other_**
**_claims._**

From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory
investigations, prosecutions or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Our
insurance or indemnities or amounts we have provisioned may not cover all claims that may be
asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may
harm our reputation. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending
ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Should the ultimate
judgments or settlements significantly exceed our insurance coverage or provisions, they could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Examinations and challenges by tax authorities, or changes in tax laws or regulations or the_**
**_application thereof, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations and prospects._**

Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation, regulations and prevailing
case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, the advice of professional tax
advisers and inferences drawn from considering similarities between our facts and circumstances and
those considered in case law. These positions may relate to, among other things, tax compliance,
gross receipts, payroll, property and income and profit tax issues. We cannot be certain that the tax
authority of the United Kingdom (the “HMRC”) will be in agreement with our view. We are subject to
periodic tax audits and any challenges made by tax authorities to our application of tax rules may result
in adjustments to tax payable by us, for example, because of adjustments to the timing or amount of
taxable income or deductions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favour, they
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects. Additionally, changes in tax laws practice relating to tax, or the application thereof, could
increase the amount of tax we must pay, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer_**
**_and our insurance costs may increase._**

We seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates under
terms that we believe are appropriate. Although we carry professional indemnity and directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities and are
subject to limits and excesses. There can be no assurances that our insurance will be sufficient to
cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and we cannot guarantee that
we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favourable terms, or at all. Certain insurance
coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance
policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities or
pay higher premiums. This would increase our expenses and reduce our EBITDA, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease our Net_**
**_Revenue and EBITDA._**

Our operating results vary with our cost of sales, which can fluctuate meaningfully based on many
factors, including:

- changes in expenses that are correlated to our AUM, such as distribution and servicing fees and
sub-manager fees;

- changes in expenses related to adviser fees;

- expenses, including salaries and benefits, incurred to retain and recruit appropriate staff;


-----

- expenses incurred in connection with our strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive
position;

- expenses incurred to maintain insurance plans, including professional indemnity insurance;

- expenses incurred in connection with regulatory requirements;

- future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation;

- changes in the costs incurred for third-party vendors that perform certain administrative and
operating services; and

- disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer
agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.

Our operating results also depend on the level of our operating expenses, which can vary significantly
for many reasons, including:

- variations in the level of total compensation expense due to changes in, among other things,
bonuses, employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, our employee count
and mix, competitive factors, market performance, and inflation;

- changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding
investment advisory services to direct retail clients;

- expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating
services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortisation, and research and
development;

- a future impairment of investments that is recognised in our consolidated balance sheet;

- a future impairment of goodwill that is recognised in our consolidated balance sheet; and

- unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill.

Under our agreements with TPA, we charge the TPI Funds certain administrative fees and related
expenses based upon contracted terms. A failure to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels
or a requirement to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects.

**_Price and earnings inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Approximately two-thirds of our operating costs are staff related. For the year ended 31 December
2020, and for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021, personnel costs (including national
insurance contributions, expenses for pensions and similar obligations as well as other employee
benefits) accounted for £9.9 million and £13.0 million, respectively. If we cannot control such costs or
pass them through to customers, our profitability may be impacted. In addition, significant increases
in inflation could impact our unit costs in other ways and potentially impact profitability and capital
position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected by the_**
**_COVID-19 pandemic._**

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a new infectious disease known
as COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (commonly known as
SARS-CoV-2), to be a global pandemic. Measures initially adopted by governments to contain the
spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, closure of businesses and workplaces, quarantine and
elective self-isolation, led to many economies effectively shutting down.


-----

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and in the United Kingdom has been severe,
notwithstanding material monetary policy support, government support measures and regulatory
intervention. Vaccines have been developed, however, and are currently being rolled out (albeit
unevenly) across countries, with high inoculation rates in the United Kingdom allowing for a substantial
easing of public health restrictions and a recovery in economic activity. However, the Delta variant, the
Omicron variant and other potential variants of the virus are ongoing concerns, while there is
uncertainty in respect of a range of matters, including the extent, duration and intensity of the financial
consequences and potential customer behaviour and societal implications. In particular, the increased
infectiousness of the Omicron variant is placing significant strains on the health care sectors of most
Western countries, including the United Kingdom. Such strains could put pressure on public finances
and jeopardise the recovery in economic activity. In addition, the effectiveness of the vaccines currently
available for periods beyond six months is in doubt, which may require governments to acquire more
vaccines and to launch further campaigns to inoculate their populations.

Global financial markets have been monitoring and reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread
of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption to the global
economy and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since our
revenue is based on the market value and composition of our AUA and AUM, the ultimate impact on
global financial markets and our clients’ decisions related to this event could adversely affect our
revenue and operating results.

Furthermore, while we have in place robust and well-established business continuity plans that
address the potential impact to our employees and our facilities, and a comprehensive suite of
technologies which enable our employees to work remotely and conduct business, no assurance can
be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate. Additionally, we must
effectively manage the ongoing risks of a remote workforce, ensure a safe working environment for
employees working onsite in our offices and adequately manage the post-pandemic transition from
remote to onsite or a hybrid working environment. In the event that our employees become
incapacitated by COVID-19, our business operations may be impacted, which could lead to
reputational and financial harm.

There can be no guarantee that any similar pandemics or outbreaks will not occur in the future or that
the effects of the current global pandemic will not deteriorate further. If such pandemics or outbreaks
occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or prospects.

**Risks Related to Regulation**

**_Our business is subject to comprehensive regulation in the United Kingdom, and we face risks_**
**_associated with compliance with these regulations._**

We are subject to comprehensive regulation in the United Kingdom. Regulatory agencies have broad
regulatory and administrative powers over many aspects of financial services businesses, which may
include governance, systems and controls requirements, conduct of business requirements (including
marketing and selling practices, advertising, customer documentation and service standards), intragroup transactions, product authorisation and governance, solvency, market conduct, liquidity, risk
concentration and permitted investments. Regulators are mainly concerned with market integrity,
financial stability and the protection of customers rather than with the interests of the shareholders or
creditors of financial services firms.

We are subject to regulation by the FCA. The FCA has broad powers, including the authority to grant,
vary the terms of or cancel a regulated firm’s authorisation, to investigate sales and marketing or
advice practices and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources. The FCA has the
power to take a variety of investigative, disciplinary or enforcement actions, including customer
restitution, public censure, fines or sanctions and (in practice) to require compensation. The FCA may
make enquiries of the companies that they regulate regarding compliance matters and, like all UK


-----

regulated financial services firms, we face the risk that the FCA could find that we have failed to comply
with applicable regulations or have not commenced corrective action as required.

We are required to contribute to compensation schemes such as the UK Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) in respect of banks and other authorised financial services firms
that are not able to meet their obligations to customers. In the future, increased provisions in respect
of these costs are likely to be needed for firms required to make FSCS contributions, including us. The
ultimate cost to the industry, which will also include the cost of any compensation payments made by
the FSCS and, if needed, the cost of meeting any shortfall after recoveries on the borrowings entered
into by the FSCS, remains uncertain but may be substantial and may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Furthermore, we are subject to unfair contract terms legislation, namely the Unfair Terms in Consumer
Contracts Regulations 1999 (the “UTCCRs”), which apply to business-to-consumer contracts entered
into prior to 1 October 2015, and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (the “CRA 2015”), which replaced the
UTCCRs and applies to business-to-consumer contracts entered into with effect from 1 October 2015.
Under the UTCCRs and the CRA 2015, a consumer may challenge a standard term in a contract on
the basis that it is unfair and not binding on the consumer, although the remainder of the contract
continues to bind the parties if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair term.

The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPR”), which implemented the EU
Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and remains part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 following the United Kingdom’s exit from the
European Union, prohibits certain practices that are deemed “unfair” within the terms of the CPR. Such
practices include misleading actions or omissions, aggressive sales tactics and failures to comply with
the requirements of professional diligence. Possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of
contract, in relation to an underlying credit agreement, may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts
to which such agreements apply. The UK Competition and Markets Authority may also take
enforcement action.

A determination that we have failed to comply with applicable regulation could have an adverse impact
on our reported results or on relations with our regulators and current and potential customers.
Regulatory action could result in the suspension or revocation of regulatory authorisations,
permissions or approvals, customer restitution, financial penalties, adverse publicity or reputational
harm, and an inability to continue to do business. This may also result in regulators subjecting us to
more intense scrutiny than would otherwise be the case, which in turn may result in higher compliance
costs, fines or other sanctions. Any of these matters could divert management’s attention from the dayto-day running of our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations (or the manner in which they_**
**_are interpreted or applied) could subject us to additional operating costs or potentially expose_**
**_us to additional liability, or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, results_**
**_of operations and prospects._**

Changes in laws and regulations, as well as changes to the manner in which they are interpreted or
applied, or uncertainty over the application or interpretation of new or revised laws, could limit our
activities in the future or could significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. Our employees
spend a significant amount of time monitoring changes in applicable laws and regulations. We are
subject to consumer credit licensing and other financial services laws, lending and collection laws,
laws related to credit reporting, consumer bankruptcy laws, laws related to the management of
consumer debt, competition and anti-trust laws, accounting standards, taxation requirements,
employment laws, communications laws, data privacy and protection laws, anti-bribery and corruption
laws and anti-money laundering laws, among others, and changes to such laws could subject us to
additional liabilities and result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


-----

From time to time, regulators may launch a review of a particular product or industry. While we may
not be specifically targeted, these reviews could negatively impact our reputation or demand for our
products. For example, following a thematic review of the pension transfer market, which has been a
key part of our recent flows, the FCA set out a package of measures in June 2020, promising in a press
release to “maintain its focus on firms providing transfer advice”. Some of these measures, such as a
ban on contingent charging, impacted our business, and if future reviews result in further new rules on
how advice should be provided to customers in this area, could lead to decreased demand for
pensions transfers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Changes to tax rates, changes in the interpretation of tax laws or the introduction of new tax_**
**_legislation could influence demand for our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Adverse changes in taxation laws (including changes to rates of taxation) and adverse changes in the
interpretation and application of existing taxation laws by courts or taxation authorities in the United
Kingdom could impact demand for our products, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We currently benefit from
customer demand supported by government policies intended to encourage personal savings through
the application of tax relief to certain types of investment. We also benefit from tax policies that offer
customers cross-border tax benefits. Changes in taxation legislation and policy, either as a result of a
change in government or otherwise, could affect investor sentiment, making investment generally, and
specific types of investment products or solutions in particular, either more or less attractive. For
example, we may be negatively affected by the loss of favourable tax treatment on savings by
individuals through ISAs or tax wrapper products, an increase in tax rates on cross-border products for
UK residents, an increase in rates of capital gains tax or a reduction in our customers’ disposable
income as a result of an increase in income tax or the introduction of wealth taxes.

We cannot predict the impact of future adverse changes in tax legislation on the tax efficiency and
attractiveness of our products and services or our business generally. Amendments to existing
legislation (particularly if there is an increase in tax rates or a withdrawal of any tax relief) or the
introduction of new rules in the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions where we may initiate future
operations may have an effect on the investment decisions of either existing or potential customers or
the advice provided to customers. Changes from time to time in the interpretation of existing tax laws,
amendments to existing tax rates or the introduction of new tax legislation could meaningfully change
saving and investment patterns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Compliance with the Investment Firms Prudential Regime may involve costs and could result in_**
**_burdens on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations and prospects._**

From 26 June 2021, firms in the European Economic Area that are authorised under Directive
2014/65/EU (“MiFID II”) became subject to a new framework for prudential requirements under the
Investment Firms Regulation 2019/2033 (“IFR”) and Investment Firms Directive 2019/2034 (“IFD”),
replacing the previous requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EU
(“CRD IV”) and Capital Requirements Regulation 575/2013 (“CRR”). Following its withdrawal from the
European Union and European Economic Area, the United Kingdom has introduced a similarly
updated regime for UK-authorised investment firms, which is similar, though not identical, to that under
IFR/IFD. This regime is referred to as the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (“IFPR”). The IFPR came
into force on 1 January 2022 and has been subject to a series of consultation papers and policy
statements by the FCA. Certain True Potential companies are UK-authorised investment firms and are
now subject to the IFPR. As a result, these companies now need to comply with the changes to the
existing prudential regime set out therein.


-----

In summary, the IFPR introduces a number of changes that affect us:

- a new methodology for the calculation of capital requirements, based on “K-factors”, which are
applied to a firm depending on the nature of the activities it undertakes and the permissions that
it holds; specifically, the IFPR sets out “risk to customer” K-factors that are potentially applicable
to all firms, based on AUM, client money held, assets safeguarded and administered, and client
orders handled (i.e. orders received/transmitted or executed for clients); additional K-factors
apply where a firm holds permission to deal as principal, relating to “risk to market” and “risk to
firm” categories;

- new initial capital, own funds, fixed overheads and permanent minimum capital requirements,
with most firms being likely to see an increase in initial capital requirements under the new IFPR
methodology;

- new liquid assets requirements, based on calculations including the firm’s fixed overheads and
any guarantees given to clients; and

- additional governance, remuneration, risk monitoring and management, and disclosure/reporting
requirements covering both disclosure to clients and reporting to the FCA.

We have assessed the impact of the new regime on us and are in compliance as of the Completion
Date. Continued compliance with the regime may involve additional costs which may indirectly affect
us and could result in additional burdens on our business. This, in turn, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, we do not
expect that the new regime will have a material effect on liquidity in the short-term (i.e. within 18 months
of the date of this Offering Memorandum) as we expect that the requirements will be satisfied through
our existing capital resources and cash flows from our operations.

**_We may fail to identify or prevent money laundering and other financial crime activities if financial_**
**_crime risks are not correctly detected and if effective controls to reduce those risks are not_**
**_implemented, which could expose us to reputational risk, substantial fines and additional_**
**_regulatory scrutiny._**

We are required to comply with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-bribery and
corruption, sanctions, anti-fraud, anti-tax evasion, insider dealing and other laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, the UK Criminal Finances Act
2017 and the extra-jurisdictional reach of international laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to conduct customer due diligence
regarding anti-money laundering, fiscal evasion, sanctions and politically exposed persons screening,
keep customer and supplier account and transaction information up to date and implement effective
financial crime policies and procedures. In particular, they prohibit us or our employees or intermediary
partners from making inappropriate payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and their
officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

Anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and insider dealing and economic sanctions
laws and regulations are increasingly complex and detailed and have become the subject of enhanced
regulatory supervision, requiring businesses to invest in improved systems, sophisticated monitoring
and skilled compliance personnel. The FCA and other regulatory authorities may occasionally make
inquiries of companies regarding compliance with regulations governing the conduct of business or
the operation of a regulated business (including the sufficiency and degree of supervision of the
business) and the treatment and handling of customers or conduct investigations when it is alleged
that regulations have been breached. Responding to such enquiries may be expensive and timeconsuming.

Financial crime is continually evolving, and this requires similarly proactive and adaptable responses
from us so that we are able to effectively deter criminality and threats. Even known threats can never
be entirely eliminated, and there may be instances in the future where we may be used by other parties
to engage in money laundering and other improper or illegal activities. In addition, we rely on our


-----

employees, external administrators and certain other third parties to identify and report such activities,
but there is a risk that they will fail to do so or otherwise fail to comply with or implement our policies
and procedures relating to financial crime.

If we are unable to comply with applicable laws, regulations and expectations, regulators and relevant
law enforcement agencies have the ability and authority to impose substantial fines and other
penalties, including requiring a complete review of business systems, day-to-day supervision by
external consultants and ultimately the revocation of regulatory authorisations and licenses.

We cannot guarantee that our existing policies and procedures are sufficient to entirely prevent
situations of fiscal evasion, bribery, money laundering, fraud or corruption, including actions by our
employees, for which we might be held responsible. Any such event may have serious consequences,
including fines, sanctions and reputational consequences, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_Regulation of privacy, data protection and security could increase our costs, as well as negatively_**
**_impact our growth._**

We are subject to legislation and regulation regarding the use of personal customer data. We process
sensitive personal customer data as part of our business and therefore must comply with strict data
protection and privacy laws. We have adopted procedures to ensure compliance with the relevant data
protection regulations by our employees and any third-party service providers, and also implemented
security measures to help prevent cyber-theft. Notwithstanding such efforts, we are exposed to the risk
that this data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data
protection legislation. As part of our continued efforts to attract and retain clients, we develop and
launch new products and services, which may require expenditure of resources and may expose us to
new regulatory or compliance requirements as well as increased risk of operational or client service
errors. If we or any of the third-party service providers on which we rely fails to store or transmit
customer information in a secure manner, or if any loss of personal customer data were otherwise to
occur, we could face liability under data protection laws. Any of these events could also result in the
loss of the goodwill of our customers and deter new customers, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

Our ability to obtain, retain and otherwise manage the personal data of our customers is governed by
the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UK GDPR”) and other data protection and privacy
requirements and regulatory rules and guidance issued by, among others, the UK Information
Commissioner. Depending on their nature and scope, changes to such laws, regulations and guidance
could require us to make additional investments in our compliance governance framework or could
alter the way in which we collect and use data. Recent changes in data regulations, including the UK
GDPR, include substantially higher compliance burdens and material increases in the maximum level
of fines for compliance failures. Going forward, these regulations may change and may make using,
accessing, transferring or storing customer documentation more onerous in the future. If we fail to
adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to the changing regulatory requirements
in this area, we could experience liability or harm to our reputation. Our ability to operate our business
depends in part on our ability to use personal data in our consumer data intelligence systems and any
regulatory changes that impair our ability to continue to use our consumer data in such systems in the
way in which we currently use them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

New requirements relating to personal customer data, either from new regulations or laws or any
additions or changes (as well as the manner in which they could be interpreted or applied) may
increase our costs and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring, the
development of information-based products and solutions and technology operations. Moreover, due
to recent account data compromise events at large companies, there has been heightened legislative
and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements. Any
of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or prospects.


-----

**_Customers or regulatory authorities may attempt to seek redress against us where it is alleged_**
**_that advice given generally or in relation to products or services was unfairly priced or unsuitable,_**
**_or otherwise failed to meet customer expectations or regulatory requirements._**

We are exposed to the risk of claims from customers or regulatory action regarding misleading
information or unsuitable advice from advisers. For instance, customers or regulators could allege that
customers were recommended products or solutions that were not suitable for them, or that the terms
and conditions of the relevant products or solutions, the nature of the products or solutions, or the
circumstances under which the products or solutions were recommended, were misrepresented to
them. In the United Kingdom, any such issues or disputes arising in relation to private individuals that
cannot be resolved privately may be determined ultimately by the Financial Ombudsman Service, FCA
enforcement action or by litigation.

Complaints may also arise if customers feel that they have not been treated fairly or reasonably, or that
the duty of care which they are owed has been breached. Issues may arise if it is alleged that
investment decisions for discretionary portfolios do not appropriately match investments to objectives
or sufficiently balance risk against performance, leading to inappropriate risk exposure for customers,
reputational damage or financial loss. We may also receive complaints regarding recommendations for
products or services that were not or are not suitable, with the potential for customer detriment,
resulting our exposure to financial loss, damage to reputation, or regulatory fines or censure. In the
United Kingdom, suitability has been an important area of regulatory focus, as demonstrated by FCA
thematic reviews and proposed follow-up work. The FCA’s supervisory focus on suitability could result
in additional enforcement actions and skilled person reviews, which may increase our exposure in this
area.

In particular, we may be exposed to risks relating to “vulnerable customers”, which the FCA has
defined as someone who, owing to their personal circumstances, is particularly susceptible to
detriment, especially when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care. The FCA has noted that
vulnerability can affect consumers across all financial products and services. Failure to identify
customer vulnerability could result in poor customer outcomes and detriment, including if a customer
is not able to fully understand products or services or if information is not provided in a suitable format
for the customer’s needs. If we do not have adequate policies to identify vulnerable customers, or if
such policies are not embedded in a way that encourages the fair treatment of all customers, we might
fall below regulatory expectations in this area, which could result in regulatory action.

In addition, in recent years the industry in general has experienced an increase in the use of social
media by customers, claims management companies and commentators to exercise influence over
financial services firms in their decision-making (for example, with regard to payment protection
insurance claims). While a substantial amount of time and resources may have been invested in
reviewing and assessing historical advice or sales practices and in the maintenance of risk
management, compliance and legal procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be no
guarantee that all of the issues associated with current and historical practices have been, or will be,
identified in the course of any review by us, nor that any issues already identified will not be more
extensive than presently estimated. The negative publicity associated with issues identified in any
advice or sales practices, any compensation payable in respect of any such issues and regulatory
changes resulting from such issues may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Issues and disputes may occasionally arise as a result of the way in which the asset management and
advisory industries have administered or sold an investment solution or other product or in the way in
which they have treated customers or investors, either individually or collectively. The regulator may
intervene directly where larger groups or matters of public policy are concerned. There have been
several industry-wide financial product mis-selling issues in the past in which the regulator in the
United Kingdom has intervened directly, including the sale of mortgage-related endowments, personal
pensions and investments in split capital investment trusts. Certain designated consumer bodies are
also empowered under the FSMA to make “super-complaints” to the FCA in relation to issues causing
detriment to significant numbers of consumers.


-----

**_Alterations to the regulations governing defined contribution pension contracts may materially_**
**_affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Individual annuities, which are not offered by us, have historically played a central role in the majority
of UK retirees’ post-retirement financial arrangements with defined contribution pension contracts (and
their subsequent annuity purchase) or defined benefit schemes, offering a tax efficient method of
saving for retirement. However, UK pension reform legislation that took effect from April 2015
(“Pension Freedom”) has given retirees increased flexibility in how to access and invest eligible
defined contribution pensions at retirement. Under Pension Freedom, consumers approaching
retirement have the choice to take the entirety of their defined contribution pension savings as cash
(the first 25% tax free, with the balance taxed at the individual’s marginal rate), including any defined
contribution savings resulting from a defined benefit transfer value. In addition, consumers who do not
draw down their pensions immediately have substantially more flexibility and control with respect to
how their pensions are invested.

We cannot be certain that the applicable laws will not be changed further, particularly given increased
regulatory attention on the pension transfer market. If we fail to attract retirees into its investment
products, achieve the expected growth following Pension Freedom or respond effectively to any further
changes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially
adversely affected.

**_We may be subject to regulatory action or financial penalties if we fail to comply with the CASS_**
**_rules._**

As we hold and control client money and safe custody assets, we must comply with the FCA’s Client
Asset Sourcebook (“CASS”) rules. The CASS requirements help to protect clients’ assets and money
when a firm is responsible for them and helps to ensure that client assets and money could be returned
within a reasonable timeframe in the event of a firm’s insolvency. Client money and asset protection
remains at the core of the FCA’s agenda, and larger firms (such as TPI) are therefore required to submit
monthly Client Money and Asset Returns to the FCA to provide key data in relation to CASS
processing. This enables the FCA to oversee firms’ CASS processing and to discuss any potential
areas of concern. Adherence to CASS requirements relies on a number of complex operational
processes and systems, both internal and external, resulting in a high inherent risk of non-compliance.
Any material CASS breaches are reported to the FCA, including as part of the firms’ annual external
CASS audit, and the FCA would be immediately notified of any material breaches. If any such breaches
were not fully remediated, or the FCA determined that we do not have sufficient regard for the
protection of clients’ assets, we may be subject to regulatory action or financial penalties, which could
also result in adverse publicity and reputational damage, and ultimately have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral**

**_Investment funds managed by Cinven own a majority of our equity and may have conflicts of_**
**_interest with us or the holders of our debt._**

Following the completion of the Acquisition, investment funds managed by Cinven hold a majority of
our capital stock and control a majority of the seats on our board of directors. As a result, and pursuant
to the Investors Agreement, Cinven has control over our decisions to enter into certain corporate
transactions and has the ability to prevent certain transactions that require the approval of the board
of directors, regardless of whether our management or the holders of our debt, including the Notes,
believe that any such transaction is in their own best interests. For example, Cinven may have an
interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, share issuances, dividend payments, financings or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such
transactions might involve risks to you. The interests of Cinven may not be entirely consistent with your
interests, and actions may be taken in relation to our business that are not entirely in your interest. For
example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the
interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests. So long as investment funds managed
by Cinven continue to own a significant amount of our capital stock or otherwise control a majority of


-----

our board of directors, Cinven will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our
decisions. In addition, we are permitted and expect to pay, from time to time, advisory and other fees,
pay dividends and make other restricted payments to Cinven under certain circumstances and Cinven
or its affiliates may have an interest in our doing so. Furthermore, Cinven has no obligation to provide
us with any additional debt or equity financing. Our sponsor is in the business of making investments
in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly
or indirectly with us or that supply us with goods and services. Cinven may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will_**
**_depend on cash flows from the operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make_**
**_payments on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity
interests it holds in each of its subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will
depend upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other
distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The
amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash
flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under
applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuer’s
subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make
distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness,
including the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Applicable law imposes certain restrictions upon the Issuer’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to
access cash of certain of the Target’s subsidiaries. The inability to transfer cash within the Group may
mean that, though we, in the aggregate, may have sufficient funds to meet our obligations, we may not
be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in the Group to another entity in the
Group in order to make payments to the Issuer for the purpose of meeting the Issuer’s obligations
under the Notes.

The subsidiaries of the Issuer have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.
While the Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on
their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to
significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable
law.

**_The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of our_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Some entities may guarantee the Notes in the
future, but until then, any claim by us or any of our creditors, including the holders of the Notes, against
any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of such
subsidiaries. The Indenture will not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any
of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein), including our subsidiaries that do not provide
guarantees for the Notes. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganisation of any of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries, creditors of these subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full from
their respective assets before the Issuer is entitled to receive any distribution from such assets as
equity holders. Except to the extent that the Issuer may itself be a creditor with recognised claims
against a subsidiary, claims of creditors of such subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims of the Issuer as an equity holder, although there is no
assurance that the claims of the Issuer as a creditor against a subsidiary may not be reduced, limited
or extinguished as a result of applicable insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of equitable
subordination or the rules regarding the potential avoidance of transactions concluded with related
persons within a certain hardening period). Our subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other


-----

creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, which liabilities are also
effectively senior to the Notes.

**_We will require cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain our_**
**_operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or cash interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our
ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to
a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and
other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors”, many of which are beyond our
control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our
debt obligations at the maturity of any of outstanding indebtedness, we may be required to refinance
our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such
refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to sell assets, or raise additional debt or
equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future
financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Indenture and our other debt
instruments may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will contain covenants that impose, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications,
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These arrangements limit our ability to, among
other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make certain other restricted
payments;

- make certain investments;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;

- agree to restrictions on dividends by restricted subsidiaries;

- transfer, lease or sell certain assets including subsidiary stock;

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

- merge or consolidate with other entities;

- engage in certain activities;

- amend certain documents; and

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

The covenants to which we are subject under the Indenture could limit our ability to finance our future
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may
be in our interest.

In addition, some of our financing arrangements require us to maintain or to meet at prescribed times
certain financial and portfolio ratios. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement”. Any future Indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms. As a result of these_
restrictions, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business and may be unable
to engage in favourable business activities or finance future operations.


-----

In addition to limiting our flexibility to operate our business, a failure to comply with the restrictions
contained in our financing arrangements, or to maintain the financial and loan portfolio ratios required
by our financing arrangements, could lead to a default under their terms that could result in an
acceleration of the Indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our future results of operations will be
sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in our financing arrangements or to remedy a
default. Moreover, our ability to maintain or to meet the financial and operational ratios under the
Revolving Credit Facility or other prospective financing arrangements can be affected by events
beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of those
covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to
applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, our creditors could
cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate, and elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. A failure to pay such amounts would also result in an event of default
under the Notes. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under a financing
arrangement could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing
arrangements. If our creditors, including those under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the
payment of amounts due thereunder, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to
repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of the group that would be due and payable
and to repay the Notes in full or in part.

**_Jersey insolvency laws may not be as favourable to you as the insolvency laws of the United_**
**_States or other countries._**

The Parent and the Issuer are incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In the event of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Jersey or another relevant jurisdiction.
The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of Jersey may be materially different from,
or in conflict with, those of the United States and other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of laws of another relevant
jurisdiction, such as England and Wales, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether
any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under
the Notes in those jurisdictions, limit any amounts that you may receive or otherwise result in a less
favourable outcome. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under
“Description of the Notes—Security”. On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Notes will be secured by limited recourse third-party security of the shares in the Issuer held by the
Parent and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the Issuer. In addition, within
30 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured by the Issuer’s material bank
accounts, its shares in the Target and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by
the Target. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and otherwise as set forth under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”, which limitations could be significant._

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations_**

**_be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will be entitled to_**
**_be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after
certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned
over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward


-----

discharging the Super Senior Obligations (including, among others, those under the Revolving Credit
Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that will be secured on a first-ranking
basis (the “Super Senior Obligations”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging
the Notes. As such, you may not benefit from amounts recovered from an enforcement of the Collateral
if the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Obligations are greater than the proceeds
recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations
under such Super Senior Obligations have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the
Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such,
the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured
creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_The Issuer and the other Collateral providers will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer and the other Collateral providers to
remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose
of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration
event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer and the other Collateral providers may,
among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing
of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do_**
**_not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of the
_Notes— Security”. In addition, the Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility. Not all of our_
assets will secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to
secure any future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be
structurally senior to the Notes) with the property and assets of the Issuer and the restricted
subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant.
If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes will not
benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other
unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or
assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.

While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of
future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles (that will be set forth in the Indenture) will set out a number
of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain
circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the
amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a
particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of
the security or guarantees provided by the Issuer.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
assets underlying the security interests granted in favour of holders of the Notes. In the event of an
enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the
assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Offering.


-----

The value of the assets forming part of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including,
among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that
could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the
economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral
may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot
assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in
the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may include
restrictions on the persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorisations and consents that are
necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations
may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby
decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement
of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental
or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents,
approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may
be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be
significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of
the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral.
With respect to any shares of the Issuer’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in addition to any applicable legal restrictions (including, without limitation, due to
financial assistance and corporate benefit reasons), such shares may also have limited value in the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first
be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured
by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the
Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the
extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured,
unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favour of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties
enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security
Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral
which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes. Moreover, if the Issuer issues Additional Notes under the Indenture or other indebtedness that
is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, holders of such Notes or other indebtedness that is
secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of
the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods_**
**_for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or voidance periods
for such Note security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of security interests to secure
future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, as the
Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or
voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest
has been granted, created, perfected, confirmed, amended or recreated. At each time, if the security
interest granted, recreated or perfected were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may
not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and


-----

_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. The same rights also apply following the issuance of the_
Notes in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as guarantors and the granting of
security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes,
as applicable.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the
provider of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be
perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary
to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in
the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in
favour of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who
claim a security interest in the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will be under
any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any
such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without_**
**_your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically,
including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the
asset sale covenant of the Indenture and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement. Even though the holders of the Notes will share in the Collateral securing
the Notes rateably with the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances,
the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging arrangements will control
enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the
holders of the Notes agree with those actions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in
the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to persons who are not U.S. persons
in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the
obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States
and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes (which
will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Notes. After payment to the common depositary, the
Issuer and the Trustee will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant
in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form”._


-----

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own
a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure
you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to
vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List._**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Authority. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed.
If the Notes are listed on the Official List, and the Issuer can no longer maintain such listing or if it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Official List; provided, however, that it will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another “recognised stock exchange”,
although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.

In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing the
Notes on the Official List or another recognised stock exchange in accordance with the Indenture,
failure to obtain approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List or another
recognised stock exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes; your ability to sell your Notes; or
the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may
have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the
Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue
market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be
subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As
a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**
**_Notes and the Collateral._**

Under Jersey law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests
granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenge in relation to transactions at an
undervalue or preference. The Royal Court may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount an official of
the Royal Court (the “Jersey Viscount”) (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
“en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up): (i) set aside a transaction (including


-----

any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person at an undervalue within
a look back period of five years; or (ii) set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security
interest) given by a company to any person within a look back period of twelve months. See
“Limitations on Validity and Security Interests the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”
for further information.

If challenged successfully, the Royal Court has the power to make such an order as it thinks fit for
restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into the transaction.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organised or incorporated outside the United States, and its business is conducted
outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of, and
substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Notes and the
Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and the Issuer will submit to the
jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you
may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer. In addition, as the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their
directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the directors and executive
officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign
jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities
laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with
Jersey. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal
securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Jersey. In addition, the enforcement in Jersey
of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in
Jersey would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action
brought in Jersey on the basis of U.S. federal securities laws violations. For further information see
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Jersey, the
United States, the jurisdiction of incorporation of a guarantor (if any) or in more than one such
jurisdiction. Any multi-jurisdictional proceeding is likely to be complex and costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your
rights under the Notes will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws, and
there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of Jersey may be materially
different from, or be in conflict with, those of the United States and other jurisdictions with which you
may be familiar, including in the areas of the rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and other
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes in
the relevant jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.


-----

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under_**
**_certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in_**
**_connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer
to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are
tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will
likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to
obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory
prepayment under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and agreements governing any future
indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which
may, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganisations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalisations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do,
may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain
consolidated net leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes
in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such
third-party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes.

The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established
meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation, such that it may not be certain that
a change of control has occurred or will occur.

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the
Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of
“change of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, it
has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and
circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may
be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes denominated in foreign_**
**_currencies._**

The GBP Notes will be denominated and payable in pounds sterling and the EUR Notes will be
denominated and payable in euro. An investment in Notes denominated in a currency other than the
currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
pound sterling and euro relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling or euro against the currency


-----

in which you measure your investment could cause a decrease in the effective yield in such currency
compared to the stated pound sterling- or euro-denominated coupon rates and could result in a loss
to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure
the return on your investments. There may be tax consequences for prospective investors as a result
of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in the Notes. See “Certain Taxation
_Considerations”._

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in “Description
_of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the_
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will
automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions)
shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—IPO Debt
_Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO_
Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture.

Such modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modification for (ii) new Notes as in place
after such modification (the “New Notes”). If such modification results in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognise any gain
or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a
deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders
(as defined under “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”)
would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the
receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes
are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional
payments would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the potential modification of the
terms of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown. It is also possible that the IPO Debt
Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating
agency at any time.

No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that
a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost
and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date thereof, the Notes issued thereunder
receive an investment grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB– or better by S&P or Fitch,
and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and


-----

continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings
agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”. At any_
time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of
which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating, if achieved, will be maintained.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the
provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those
respecting preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee.

**_The Issuer and its subsidiaries may become subject to the Investment Company Act._**

Finance businesses are potentially subject to registration and regulation as “investment companies”
under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940. This is in part because loans on the books of such
a business may be deemed to be “investment securities”, which, in turn, can characterise the business
as an investment company. Operation of a business that is required to be registered as an “investment
company” under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, but is not so registered, presents a variety
of risks, including the potential for regulatory fines, actions that could be taken to dissolve the
business, disqualification of contracts and the like. We do not believe that any of the Issuer, the Target
or their respective subsidiaries is required to be so registered. If that were to change, material
modifications to the business of the Target and its subsidiaries would be needed either to come into
compliance with the applicable regulations or to seek to avoid registration.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for US federal income tax_**
**_purposes._**

U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) of Notes issued with OID will be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary_
income) over the term of such Notes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income
is attributable (regardless of such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes). See “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

###### THE TRANSACTIONS

**The Acquisition**

On 8 September 2021, the Issuer entered into a sale and purchase deed (the “Acquisition
**Agreement”) for the purchase from the persons named therein as senior partners (the “Senior**
**Partners”), the persons named therein as other shareholders (the “Other Shareholders”) and FTV-**
True, LLC (“FTV”, and, together with the Senior Partners and the Other Shareholders, in their capacity
as sellers under the Acquisition Agreement, the “Sellers”) of all of the issued and outstanding share
capital (the “Shares”) of the Target (the “Acquisition”). Completion of the Acquisition (“Completion”,
and such date, the “Completion Date”) took place on 21 January 2022 following the satisfaction of
certain regulatory conditions, including approval by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) of
the Issuer’s acquisition of control over the FCA-authorised subsidiaries of the Target. Pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer acquired the Shares for approximately £1,808.7 million (the
“Purchase Price”).

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Cinven Funds indirectly acquired a majority stake in the
Target Group through intermediate holding companies, including Kane Feederco Limited, Kane Topco
Limited, the Parent and the Issuer. On Completion, the Cinven Funds acquired beneficial ownership of
a majority stake of 68.7%, with the Sellers reinvesting a portion of the sale proceeds and retaining a
31.3% minority interest.

**The Financing**

The Acquisition was financed as follows:

- the Cinven Funds and the Sellers contributed £1,795.2 million, directly or indirectly, by way of
equity (the “Equity Contribution”), of which £1,232.6 million was contributed by the Cinven
Funds and £562.6 million was equity reinvested by the Sellers; and

- the Issuer entered into a bridge facility agreement on 19 January 2022 (the “Bridge Facility
**Agreement”), which provides for term borrowings of £675.0 million (the “Bridge Facility”) and**
drew the full amount of available borrowings.

In addition, the Issuer entered into a revolving credit facility agreement on 19 January 2022 (the
“Revolving Facility Agreement”), which provides for multi-currency borrowings of £100.0 million (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in an amount of £50.0 million on
the Completion Date, providing the Target with cash for working capital liquidity.

The Equity Contribution, the full amounts drawn under the Bridge Facility and the amount drawn under
the Revolving Credit Facility were used to: (i) pay the Purchase Price for the Acquisition; (ii) repay in
full and cancel the existing indebtedness of the Target in an amount of approximately £615.0 million;
(iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein) in an amount of
£45.1 million; and (iv) fund the Issuer's balance sheet with £52.4 million.

The above financings are collectively referred to herein as the “Financing”. The proceeds from the
Offering will be used to repay and cancel the Bridge Facility (the “Refinancing”).

The Financing, the Acquisition, the repayment and cancellation of the existing indebtedness of the
Target and the Refinancing are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions”. See “Use of
_Proceeds”._

Our aim is to revolutionise the way wealth management is delivered. We believe that by using
technology to deliver financial services, we empower financial advisers and their clients to take control
of their futures. By providing what we call “hybrid advice”, blending technology with expert financial
advice, we are able to offer clients the access and support they need 24/7, while ensuring that they
have an adviser to speak to whenever needed.

We are privileged to work with approximately 17% of UK financial advisers and their clients through
either our fully integrated model or through our software offering, meaning we can have a real impact
on how UK households invest their money and save for retirement.

We grow through accelerated adviser recruitment and client and AUM acquisition. We offer certain
advisers seeking capital to fund their growth a loan of 2% of their total assets under management when
they become Wealth Management Partners. Our recruitment programmes have contributed to rapid
growth in our AUM from £6.0 billion as at 31 December 2018 to £16.5 billion in our own funds as at
30 September 2021.

True Potential is primarily made up of the following businesses:

- TPI, which provides our purpose-built, in-house proprietary wealth management platform and our
own exclusive investment fund range;

- TPWM, which is our wealth management advice proposition with 844 self-employed Wealth
Management Partners as well as our 40-member in-house Central Advice Team;

- TPAS, which provides technology, adviser support and compliance services to approximately 598
financial advice firms with approximately 3,600 individual advisers representing more than one
million clients; and

- TPA, which is the in-house ACD for the TPI Funds.


-----

As a fully integrated wealth manager participating in all parts of the value chain, we service all stages
of the wealth management process. We benefit from synergies across our ecosystem, with our
distribution, investment management and technology capabilities complementing each other. Our fully
integrated ecosystem enables and benefits from a multi-channel distribution model with multiple fee
streams. New investments pass through the True Potential platform and are invested in our ten True
Potential Portfolios, enabling us to capture economies across the value chain. Our multiple distribution
channels include (i) our wealth management advice channel TPWM, (ii) our adviser support services
channel TPAS and (iii) a D2C and auto-enrolment pension channel, where clients do not receive
financial advice. Assets that originated via these distribution channels then flow primarily to TPI, where
they are held and managed. Our multiple fee streams in TPI include (i) platform fees, (ii) fund fees and
(iii) performance fees, while TPWM also benefits from financial advice fees and TPAS also generates
revenue from service fees.

Our revenue has become increasingly diversified across channels, resulting in robust AUA and AUM
expansion, supported by a growing recruitment programme that has led to double-digit revenue
growth and margin expansion. From 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, AUA on the True
Potential platform increased by £11.1 billion, or 143.6%, and AUM invested in TPI Funds increased by
£10.6 billion, or 177.3%. Our Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 was
£165.3 million, which was generated from gross revenue of £260.4 million, and our EBITDA was £122.6
million, representing an EBITDA Margin of 74.2% and an EBITDA CAGR of 67.8% from 31 December
2018 to 30 September 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021
was £160.0 million.

Gross Asset Inflows grew from £2.2 billion in 2018 to £4.2 billion in 2020 to £4.9 billion in the nine
months ended 30 September 2021. Over recent years, organic growth has been the “traditional” route
for Gross Asset Inflows through adviser and productivity growth and remains a strong underpin. The
majority of Gross Asset Inflows in 2018 and 2019 came from organic channels, most notably through
TPWM, which accounted for approximately 52% in 2018 and approximately 40% in 2019, and TPAS,
which represented approximately 43% in 2018 and 24% in 2019. In recent years, management has
been reinvesting cash flows into various recruitment initiatives, increasing the level of inorganic growth
given the market opportunity.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by a variety of factors, a number of which
are outside of our control. Set out below is a discussion of the most significant factors that have
affected our financial results during the periods under review and which we currently expect to affect
our financial results in the future. Factors other than those presented below could also have a
significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the future.

**_Levels of AUA and AUM_**

The most significant components of our revenue are the fees, including fund fees and platform fees,
that are charged as percentages of our AUA and AUM. Fund fees and platform fees represented 33.1%
and 22.2%, respectively, of our total revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021.
Accordingly, the levels of our AUA and AUM are the main determinants of our fee revenue. As at
30 September 2021, we had AUA of £18.8 billion and AUM of £16.5 billion. For the twelve-month period
ended 30 September 2021, our Net Revenue was £165.3 million.

As further discussed below, our levels of AUA and AUM are driven by levels of inflows and outflows that
correlate with how many financial advisers and end clients we have during the relevant period. In
addition, investment market conditions impact our AUA and AUM levels, such as the economic
environment in the United Kingdom and internationally and our prior investment performance, as well
as structural factors, such as demographic trends, the accelerating adoption of financial technology
and regulatory tailwinds.


-----

We have experienced an increase in net inflows to our platform each year since the formation of True
Potential. Our AUA and AUM as at 31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 and 30 September 2021 are set
out below.

_Growing Network of Financial Advisers_

Our levels of AUA and AUM are correlated with our growing network of advisers, including our Wealth
Management Partners and our Central Advice Team. Our number of Wealth Management Partners has
increased from 435 as at 31 December 2017 to 844 as at 30 September 2021. In addition, we have built
out our Central Advice Team, which is made up of 40 in-house financial advisers and staff. Our growth
in number of advisers is illustrated below by the number of net new advisers in each of the full years
from 2018 through 2020 as well as the first nine months of 2021.

Advisers who have joined True Potential have proven to be productive, and this productivity has been
consistently robust across cohorts (according to which year they were hired).

_Total Number of Clients and Client Retention_

As at 30 September 2021, we had approximately 1.2 million total end clients using our services. Our
overall end client retention rate is 97.6%, with strong client retention no matter if clients have been
transferred to True Potential with advisers hired under our client acquisition and adviser recruitment
programme (99.3%) or have been referred to True Potential by a Wealth Management Partner or a
TPAS firm (95.8%).

Our strong client retention corresponds to low Client AUA Churn. Our Client AUA Churn for each of the
years ended 31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021
have remained below 10%, as shown in the chart below. The primary driver of Client AUA Churn has
been regular business where clients begin drawing down income, with transfers and closures
(i.e. clients withdrawing their funds in order to close their account) driving a lower percentage of Client
AUA Churn since 2019. In addition, because client funds are fully invested, a percentage of assets is
periodically sold in order to provide the funds to pay fees. Such amounts, which have not historically
been tracked as a component of Client AUA Churn, equalled 1.1% of average AUA for the twelve
months ended 30 September 2021.

Strong client retention and low Client AUA Churn translate to high recurring revenue for our business,
as illustrated by the chart below, which shows Recurring Net Revenue representing 89% of total Net
Revenue for each period. All of our advice, platform and fund fees are recurring in nature. The main
revenue item we classify as non-recurring is performance fees.


-----

In addition, as a fully integrated wealth manager, we offer services for all stages of the wealth
management process. The proportion of Integrated Flows, calculated as TPI flows divided by total
flows, which increased from 89% in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 93% in the twelve-month
period ended 30 September 2021, clearly demonstrates how the uniqueness of our business model
and how we capture economies across the value chain. As a result, the full integration of True
Potential’s business model allows us to offer clients significantly lower fees than our main competitors,
while maintaining strong profitability. See “Our Business—Competitive Strengths—Fully integrated
_business model drives capture of top of funnel flows and provides a competitive edge”._

_Overhead Costs_

Our overhead costs are set out below. The following table provides a breakdown of our overhead costs
for the years ended 31 December 2018, 2019, 2020 and for the last twelve months ended
30 September 2021 as well as the CAGR from 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021.

Overhead costs (including management bonus) increased from £28.6 million to £34.5 million at a
CAGR of 15.6% from 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, while Net Revenue increased at a
CAGR of 46.2% for the same period. Cost base of overhead costs (other than direct variable costs
deducted in Net Revenue) are largely fixed in nature, mainly relating to staff costs. Head office costs
are incurred at our headquarters in Newcastle and include, among other things, office rent,
maintenance of the building and the surrounding area, service costs, heating costs and building
insurance. Our overhead costs increased at a slower rate than Net Revenue, driving operating leverage
and an increase in our EBITDA Margin.

Recruitment costs are incurred by regional sales directors who acquire potential new wealth managers
to drive sales. From 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, the increase in the recruitment and
training costs for new advisers reflects higher recruitment of advisers and regional sales directors to
support the growth in our 2% and 8% propositions in our client acquisition and adviser recruiting
programme.

Sponsorship and marketing costs are incurred for online or paper-based marketing campaign
materials that are sent to clients and include marketing from firms such as Google to advertise our
services and grow our platform. Sponsorship and marketing costs were higher in 2018 following an
increased effort to attract additional D2C customers.

Staff costs related to the employees of the business include salaries, bonuses, national insurance,
recruitment, training and qualification costs. The increase in staff costs during this period is mainly due
to the growth in our full-time equivalent employees as a result of our business scaling.


-----

Technology costs relate to running our platform and standard IT costs that entail variable costs specific
for systems such as utilising the cloud, which is a pay-as-you-use service. The IT costs during this
period are mainly relating to outsourcing, platform running costs of SEI platform, which we transitioned
off in 2018, as well as software licenses.

Professional and regulatory costs include consultancy, insurance, legal, audit and CASS audit services
fees, as well as the FCA levy, which includes our contribution to the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service. The increase in the professional and regulatory costs
from 2018 to 2021 are mainly driven by higher insurance costs and increase in FCA fees. Other costs
in our overhead costs are related to sundry costs of our business.

Other costs include insurance costs, including our professional indemnity insurance, public liability
insurance and employers’ liability policies, as well as miscellaneous costs related to items such as
telephone and telecommunications, subscriptions and licenses. Our costs are impacted by
depreciation, an accounting method used to allocate the cost of our tangible assets, such as fixtures,
fittings and computer equipment, over its useful life. Fixtures and fittings depreciate over five years,
while computer equipment depreciates over three years. Our costs are also impacted by amortisation,
which is calculated on a straight-line basis, primarily relates to the 2016 investment in True Potential by
FTV and the 20-year useful life on recruitment acquisitions.

_Economic Environment in the United Kingdom and Internationally_

The economic environment in the United Kingdom and internationally has affected, and will continue
to affect, our results of operations. Factors such as the strength and volatility of capital markets, interest
rates, inflation, consumer spending, business investment and exchange rates all affect the economic
environment, investor confidence and, ultimately, the volume and profitability of our business. Such
conditions impact the value of customer investment portfolios, which in turn impacts our results
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from fees that are calculated as a percentage
of AUA or AUM. While a growing economy is likely to lead to higher levels of investment that increase
our AUA and AUM, an economic downturn characterised by lower corporate earnings, lower business
investment, higher unemployment, lower household income and lower consumer spending, may
adversely affect the demand for savings products. Further, customer sentiment regarding the future
prospects of debt and equity markets, exchange rates and inflation, and more generally of the
economy and investment markets, could impact customer behaviour and impact demand for our
investment products and services. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult
_macroeconomic conditions could lead to asset price declines or volatility which may adversely affect_
_the market value of our AUA and AUM, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects”._


-----

_Investment Performance_

Although the past performance of the True Potential Portfolios and the underlying TPI Funds is not a
guarantee of future results, increases in asset values and positive investment returns and performance
may increase the amount of our AUM and consequently may increase the fee revenue we earn from
those assets. At the same time, poor investment performance resulting in stagnating or declining asset
values and investment returns may have a negative impact on our results. Growth in the True Potential
Portfolios since their inception in October 2015 and for the twelve-month period ended 30 September
2021 are set forth below.

–––––––––     –––––––––
The investment performance of each of the True Potential Portfolio and the underlying TPI Funds is a
factor that could impact inflows and outflows into these products because advisers and end clients are
attracted to products with a consistent, strong record of investment performance. Investment
performance will therefore continue to affect our AUA and AUM and, in turn, will have an impact on our
revenue and financial results as our revenue is derived as a percentage of our AUA and AUM.

_Accelerating Adoption of Financial Technology_

Consumers of financial services products and services are becoming increasingly technologically
aware, which is driving them and their assets to flow to online platform businesses such as ours. Our
technology platform offers a broad array of services catering to the needs of both advisers and clients.
Some of the key client-facing features (including those specific to True Potential) include Digital Direct
Offer (allowing customers to transfer products to True Potential through an entirely digital journey),
impulseSave (allowing customers to top up their ISA or other savings product directly with no minimum
amount), policy transfer, secure messaging, bank integration and the personal finance modules. Our
technology platform as well as reporting and processing tools also have a comprehensive suite of
services tailored for our advisers to run a day-to-day business and support our customers.

From the outset, our founding partners believed that technology would play a pivotal role in the wealth
management industry and our vision 14 years ago was to be an agile, innovative, end-to-end, multichannel “wealthtech” via an integrated technology platform. Our technology platform is the core of the
firm. It is a fully integrated tech stack for advisers and clients that enables better user experience and
enhanced cross selling and was built and developed in-house by a focused multi-disciplinary team led
by our founding partners and shareholders.

_Government Policy, Legislation and Regulation_

We are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation. Changes in government policy, legislation
or regulation applied to companies in the financial services industry in the United Kingdom have
historically impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations. For example, changes in


-----

taxation legislation applicable to our products have impacted our results of operations in the past and
further changes in taxation legislation could impact our results of operations in the future.

A number of regulatory changes and government initiatives in the United Kingdom (including Pension
Freedom, the increasing ISA subscription limits and the continued shift from defined benefit to defined
contribution pensions) have put the onus of long-term and retirement savings on individuals rather
than the government or employers. This has led consumers to seek out financial advice from providers
such as us. Financial advisers have also increasingly moved their clients’ assets to platforms such as
ours where financial advice, investment platform services and portfolio investment solutions are all
available from a single provider.

The growth of the investment platform market has led to increased focus from the FCA and ongoing
review of the market, which may create an increasingly stringent regulatory regime for us to comply
with. Our compliance with changes in regulation have to an extent, and may in the future, lead to
increased operating and administrative costs. Recent and ongoing regulatory reform initiatives include
MiFID II, the PRIIPs regulation, Solvency II, the IFPR and GDPR. These regulations could make it more
expensive for us to conduct our business, require us to make changes to our business model, require
us to satisfy increased capital requirements, necessitate time-consuming and costly implementation
measures, or subject us to greater regulatory scrutiny.

We are also subject to regulatory review, whether as part of an industry-wide review, a firm-specific
assessment or otherwise. The outcome of such reviews, though difficult to predict, could have an
impact on our results of operations. For example, possible outcomes include a requirement to
compensate customers for losses or certain costs they have incurred as a result of the products they
were sold or services they received or the initiation of regulatory enforcement action against us,
potentially including the imposition of a fine. Further, even if we are not named specifically, these
reviews could negatively impact our reputation or demand for our products.

A number of studies and thematic reviews have been initiated or undertaken by the UK regulators.
These include the FCA’s asset management review, the findings of which were published on 28 June
2017, and the Investment Platforms Market Study, the terms of reference for which were announced
on 17 July 2017.

We may also be affected by future changes in government in the United Kingdom, which may lead to
changes in government policy, legislation or regulatory interpretation applied to us and may ultimately
influence investor decisions, change the structure of the market and the products offered or increase
the costs of doing business. Changes in government could also introduce a range of anti-wealth
policies.

**_Product Mix and Distribution Channels_**

True Potential Group Limited is the holding company of the subsidiaries described below. Although
True Potential Group Limited does not generate turnover, its activity accounts for our head office costs.

Flows onto the platform are generated from TPWM (Wealth Management Partners and Central Advice
Team), TPAS and D2C distribution channels. TPWM is a restricted advice firm. Wealth Management
Partners are contracted to invest in TPI Funds and the Central Advice Team also manages client assets
held on the platform and in the funds. Through TPAS, we provide back-office software to independent
financial advisers who are then able to choose to use the platform and funds or third-party alternatives.
And finally, D2C is a small component of our inflows where customers come direct onto the platform
(without advice). Our key revenue streams come from the subsidiaries as described below:

- True Potential Investments – generates platform fees, investment management fees and
performance fees.

- True Potential Wealth Management – (i) Wealth Management Partners generate revenue in the
form of advice fees, 90% of which the adviser retains, while True Potential gains the remaining


-----

10%, and (ii) Central Advice Team advisers also generate revenue in the form of advice fees,
where TPWM retains 100% of the fees.

- True Potential Adviser Services – typically charge fees based on adviser turnover in exchange for
back-office services.

The chart below sets out the breakdown of the Adjusted Net Revenue contribution by distribution
channels for the twelve months ended 30 September 2021.

The following sections describe each entity’s contribution to the Group’s Net Revenue, through the
distribution channels.

_True Potential Investments_

As at 30 September 2021, the True Potential platform had AUA of £18.8 billion, of which £16.5 billion
were AUM invested in exclusive TPI Funds and the remainder were in third-party funds. AUA growth
from £7.7 billion as at 31 December 2018 through 30 September 2021 represents a CAGR of 38.2%.
TPI Funds AUM have grown at a CAGR of 44.9% from £6.0 billion as at 31 December 2018 to £16.5
billion as at 30 September 2021. TPI Funds AUM have also delivered better economics for True
Potential assets than AUA invested in third-party funds, while also delivering savings to clients as client
charges for the most invested portfolio, the True Potential Balanced Portfolio, decreased from 82 basis
points in 2018 to 80 basis points in 2021, while the net fund margin for TPI Funds increased from 80
basis points in 2018 to 100 basis points in 2021.

TPI receives platform fees, fund fees and performance fees. In addition, investors paid an average of
75 basis points for their financial advice from Wealth Management Partners during the twelve-month
period ended 30 September 2021, approximately 10% of which was recorded as revenue for True
Potential. For the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021, investors paid approximately 40
basis points for access to the True Potential platform. True Potential records around 66 basis points of
gross revenue as fund fees, with approximately 18 basis points of the fund fee being passed along to
sub-advisers for the TPI Funds. True Potential's Growth Aligned Fund range includes a performance
fee that only becomes payable if the unit price of the fund is above the high watermark, which is
measured as the highest unit price at each previous 30 April.

TPI’s revenue can be broken down into distribution channels as set out below.

- The Wealth Management Partners distribution channel contributed £63.5 million, or 46.7%, of
TPI’s Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This contribution was
made up of flows that have settled as AUA and AUM that generate platform fees, fund fees and
performance fees paid by clients. The Net Revenue contribution of platform fees and fund fees for
the restricted adviser channel were £26 million and £28.7 million, respectively, for the twelvemonth period ended 30 September 2021. Performance fees earned from this channel during this
period amounted to £8.8 million.


-----

- The Central Advice Team recruitment channel contributed £34.2 million, or 25.2%, of TPI’s Net
Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This contribution was made up
of platform fees, fund fees and performance fees paid by clients. The Net Revenue contribution
of platform fees and fund fees for the Central Advice Team recruitment channel were £13.9 million
and £15.6 million, respectively, for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021.
Performance fees earned from this channel during this period amounted to £4.8 million. For
additional information on Central Advice Team recruitment, see “True Potential Wealth
_Management—Central Advice Team Recruitment” below._

- The TPAS channel contributed £26.5 million, or 19.5%, of TPI’s Net Revenue for the twelve-month
period ended 30 September 2021. This channel was responsible for the contribution of £5.2
billion on the platform as at 30 September 2021, of which £3.1 billion was invested in TPI Funds.
The revenue contribution of platform fees and fund fees for TPAS firms were £13.7 million and
£9.8 million, respectively, for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. Performance
fees earned from this channel during this period amounted to £3.0 million. For additional

_True Potential Wealth Management_

TPWM generates fees from both the Wealth Management Partners and the Central Advice Team
channels. These fees are made up of advice fees and the previously stated flows onto the platform
through these two distribution channels. Clients pay ongoing advice fees to their Wealth Management
Partners of around 56 basis points of the amount invested and one-off fees of around 64 basis points
of the amount invested, 90% of which is retained by the Wealth Management Partners and 10% is
recorded as Net Revenue for True Potential. Clients pay ongoing advice fees of 50 basis points of the
amount invested to the Central Advice Team, which is 100% retained by True Potential. For the twelvemonth period ended 30 September 2021, advice fees for Wealth Management Partners contributed
£7.4 million of Net Revenue and for Central Advice Team contributed £18.3 million of Net Revenue.

TPWM-advised AUM has experienced significant growth supported by a multi-pronged sales strategy.
AUM for Wealth Management Partners grew from £1.6 billion at the end of 2015 to £2.3 billion at the
end of 2016, £3.3 billion at the end of 2017 and £4.1 billion at the end of 2018. In 2019, the Central
Advice Team recruitment programme started, adding additional AUM from the Central Advice Team to
total AUM. TPWM-advised AUM grew to £6.1 billion at the end of 2019, made up of £1.3 billion from
the Central Advice Team and £4.8 billion from Wealth Management Partners. At the end of 2020, total
AUM for TPWM grew to £9.0 billion, including £2.8 billion from the Central Advice Team and £6.2 billion
from Wealth Management Partners. As at 30 September 2021 total AUM for TPWM was £13.0 billion,
with £4.5 billion from the Central Advice Team and £8.5 billion from self-employed Wealth Management
Partners. The gross profit margin for TPWM was 11%, 13% and 9% in 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively, before growing to 11%, 14% and 23% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. TPWM gross
profit margin for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 was 28%.

In order to obtain more financial advisers, increase sales and thus our overall AUA, we buy advisers’
portfolios, through our client acquisition programmes, which are bought out at 2% or 8% of their total
value. See “Business—Client Acquisition and Adviser Recruiting Programme”.

Financial advisers are recruited one by one, with each individual being subject to a detailed review
against our robust recruitment standards. This includes an assessment of their solvency and personal
financial history, complaints record, key performance indicators, references for the previous six years,
qualifications, continuing professional development and previous firms’ competency assessments. We
will only approve an individual where we are confident they have not previously caused any client
detriment and that they will not cause client detriment or reputational risk to TPWM.

**_Capital Requirements and Liquidity Management_**

The Group consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2020 showed a net liability
position of £170.8 million (31 December 2019: £182.6 million), however, based on the directors’
assessment, there are sufficient cash resources and financing facilities available to meet ongoing
operational and capital requirements.

As at 30 September 2021, the Group’s net liability position was £156.8 million. This includes a total of
£36.2 million, across both current and non-current liabilities, that. The ability of the Group to meet this
liability was supported with the available financing facility of £20.1 million plus further cash resources
of £52.6 million.

Management closely monitors the Group’s cash flow and financial position throughout the year,
running daily forward-looking modelling, to ensure there are sufficient funds available to meet liabilities
as they fall due and sufficient headroom on requirements.

Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, while in other sections of this Offering
Memorandum we use the term “revenue” to refer to the same information. Similarly, references to
“gross profit” in this _Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations— Explanation of Key Line Items correspond to references to Net Revenue elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum.

**_Turnover_**

Group turnover is made up of three main components. TPI turnover represents fees earned from
provision of the True Potential Wealth Management platform and the annual management charge in
respect of the TPI Funds. TPWM turnover represents advice fees earned from our restricted wealth
management advice proposition. TPAS turnover represents fees earned from the provision of
back-office services to financial advice firms.

_True Potential Investments_

The principal activity of TPI is that of provision of a wealth management platform and investment
management firm.

Turnover is generated from: (i) the platform fee charged to clients for the administration and provision
of technology services to the client; (ii) an annual management charge payable by the client for the
investment in the TPI Funds; and (iii) a performance fee payable on the True Potential Growth Aligned
Fund Range, which only becomes payable if the unit price of the fund is above the high watermark.
The high watermark is measured as the highest unit price at each previous 30 April.

_Performance Fee_

The performance fee is calculated as 10% of the fund unit price growth above the high watermark,
which is measured as the highest unit price at each previous 30 April. Any performance fee payable is
accrued at a fund level on a daily basis. The final fee for the fund year is calculated as at 30 April each
year. The effect of only accruing this fee when the fund provides returns above the high watermark is
to align our goals with the goals of our clients.

Following a strong performance and highly positive returns to investors in the funds during 2020, the
performance fee accrued within the funds as at 31 December 2020 was £9.4 million. The related
revenue has been recognised in the year on the basis that it is probable that future economic benefits
will flow to the entity, following calculation of the final fee for the fund year as at 30 April 2021. The
weighted average unit price at 31 December 2020 was 111.10 against a weighted average high
watermark of 100.67, giving headroom of 10.36% above the high watermark.

The performance fee accrues daily, and the fund unit price was measured against the high watermark
as at 30 April 2021. The performance fee of £20.2 million was paid in cash in May 2021. If at 30 April
the fund price had fallen below the high watermark, then no performance fee would have been payable
to TPI.

_True Potential Wealth Management_

The principal activity of TPWM is that of a Wealth Management Firm. Wealth management advice is
provided to the clients via either a self-employed Wealth Management Partner or by the Central Advice
Team. Fees are charged to clients on an initial advice and recurring advice basis, as set out in the
contracts with the clients.

_True Potential Adviser Services_

The principal activity of TPAS is that of provision of services to financial services distribution firms and
their clients. Services include our award-winning technology, adviser support and compliance. Fees
are charged to the firms as a percentage of firm turnover based on the level of service undertaken.


-----

_True Potential Administration_

The principal activity of TPA is that of provision of authorised corporate director services. The service
is provided only to TPI.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Three of the Group’s entities generate cost of sales.

_True Potential Investments_

The cost of sales within TPI represents the fees paid to the sub-fund managers appointed by TPI. There
is no cost of sale with regard to the platform fee as the technology has been built in-house.

_True Potential Wealth Management_

The cost of sales within TPWM represents the payments to Wealth Management Partners in respect to
the financial advice fees generated. TPWM retains a percentage of the advice fee, paying away the
majority to the Wealth Management Partner. There is no cost of sales related to the advice fees
generated from Central Advice Team fees.

_True Potential Administration_

The cost of sales within TPA comprises depositary fees (including the depositary custody safekeeping,
asset servicing and transaction fees and charges), fund administration fees and fund audit fees.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Our administrative expenses are set out below.

**_Goodwill and Brand Amortisation_**

Goodwill and brand amortisation represent the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is eliminated by amortisation through the
profit and loss account over ten years on a straight-line basis, which is the presumed useful economic
life of goodwill under UK GAAP. Our goodwill and brand amortisation relates directly to the 2016
investment in True Potential by FTV.

**_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_**

Interest payable and similar charges consist of the interest accruing in the year on all financial liabilities
with an implicit or explicit return, calculated by applying the effective interest method, irrespective of
measurement at fair value (except for those that might have arisen from derivatives).

**_Tax on Profit_**

Tax on profit consists of the tax payable on the taxable profit, adjusted by the amount of the year
changes in the assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences and of any tax credit or tax loss
carry forwards.

**_Profit for the Period_**

Profit for the period consists of gross income less administrative expenses, goodwill and amortisation,
interest payable and similar charges and tax on profit.

_TPI Turnover_

Total TPI revenue increased by £51.3 million, or 67.6%, from £75.9 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2020 to £127.2 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by an increase in AUA of £6.5 billion to £16.5 billion which in turn led to a
rise in platform fees, and investment management fees, the main drivers of TPI Turnover. £10.9 million
of TPI Turnover was due to the performance fee.

_TPWM Turnover_

TPWM turnover increased by £24.3 million, or 50.7%, from £47.9 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2020, to £72.2 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by an increase in Wealth Management Partners from 656 as at
31 December 2020 to 844 as at 30 September 2021, which coincided with a £4.9 billion, or 35%, rise
in AUA, from £13.9 billion as at 31 December 2020 to £18.8 billion as at 30 September 2021. This
increase in turn led to a rise in advice fees for our Wealth Management Partners and our Central Advice
Team. In addition, turnover from advisers in our recruitment programme more than doubled.

_TPAS Turnover_

TPAS turnover increased slightly by £0.1 million, from £3.6 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020, to £3.7 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This is
expected as this is part of the business strategy to maintain a stable fee rates through long-term
contracts with firms.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £18.7 million, or 35%, from £55.6 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020, to £74.3 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by the amount paid to TPWM advisers, which grew by £14.3 million.
Despite this increase, gross profit for TPWM increased from 23.1% to 28.0%, which was due to the
change in turnover mix to Central Advice Team clients who do not have TPWM advisers or the
corresponding fees. The following table presents a break-down of our cost of sales between TPI,
TPWM, TPAS and TPA.

_Gross Profit_

30 September 2020 to £128.7 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by the growth seen in TPI Turnover whilst cost of sales only increased by
33%, primarily as a result of the Central Advice Team’s contribution in TPWM whereby a higher


-----

proportion of fees are retained within the business instead of being paid to our Wealth Management
Partners.

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses increased by £13.0 million, or 48.9%, from £26.6 million for the nine-month
period ended 30 September 2020 to £39.6 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September
2021. This increase was mainly driven by a combination of amortisation from client acquisitions of £4.4
million and an increase in staff numbers by 66 over the period, from 311 as at 30 September 2020 to
377 as at 30 September 2021.

_Operating Profit before Goodwill Amortisation_

Operating profit before goodwill amortisation increased by £43.8 million, or 96.7%, from £45.3 million
for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 to £89.1 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2021. This increase was mainly driven by the growth demonstrated in the gross profit,
along with a relatively lower increase in administrative expenses.

_Goodwill and Brand Amortisation_

Goodwill and brand amortisation remained stable at £11.6 million for each of the nine-month periods
ended 30 September 2020 and 2021. This is a result of the ten-year straight line amortisation policy.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by £43.9 million, or 130.3%, from £33.7 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2020 to £77.6 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by the growth demonstrated in the gross profit. A breakdown of operating
profit by operating entity is set out below.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £48.6 million, or 99.2%, from £49.0 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020 to £97.6 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by an improvement in fund margin generated by TPI, and the result of an
increase in AUA to £18.8 billion from £12.0 billion during the period. Please see “Summary Historical
_Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and Operating Information—Non-GAAP Financial_
_Information”._

_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £4.7 million, or 19.4%, from £24.2 million for the
nine-month period ended 30 September 2020, to £28.9 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2021. This increase was mainly driven by an increase in gross debt of £153.1 million.
Although debt increased, there was a reduction in the margin applicable to the debt.

_Profit before Taxation_

Profit before taxation increased by £39.2 million, or 412.6%, from £9.5 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2020 to £48.7 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by increased profits generated by TPI, as a result of the AUA increase to
£18.8 billion for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021.

_Tax on Profit_

Tax on profit increased by £9.2 million, or 209.1%, from £4.4 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020 to £13.6 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by our trading performance, with profit before tax increased from £9.5
million to £48.7 million during this period.


-----

_Profit for the Period_

Profit for the period increased by £30.0 million, or 588.2%, from £5.1 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2020 to £35.1 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by profits generated by TPI due to the lack of additional costs required to
generate profits.

**_Comparison of the Year Ended 31 December 2020 to the Year Ended 31 December 2019_**

_Turnover_

Turnover increased by £40.0 million, or 27.6%, from £144.9 million for the year ended 31 December

31 December 2019 to £112.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. This increase was mainly
driven by an increase in AUA from £10.4 billion as at 31 December 2019 to £13.9 billion as at
31 December 2021, which in turn led to a rise in platform fees, investment management fees and
performance fees, which are the main drivers of TPI Turnover.

31 December 2019 to £67.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. This increase was driven

TPAS turnover decreased by £0.5 million, or 9.4%, from £5.3 million for the year ended
31 December 2019 to £4.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. This decrease was expected
as it is part of the business strategy to maintain a competitive structure and to channel target sales onto
the TPI platform.

Cost of sales increased by £9.4 million, or 14.0%, from £67.0 million for the year ended 31 December

increased costs from commission paid to Wealth Management Partners and, to a lesser extent, from
costs in TPI Funds. The following table presents a break-down of our cost of sales between TPI, TPWM,
TPAS and TPA.

Administrative expenses increased by £5.7 million, or 16.7%, from £34.2 million for the year ended
31 December 2019 to £39.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. This increase was mainly

numbers by 34, from 283 as at 31 December 2019 to 317 as at 31 December 2020.

a reduction in the margin applicable to the debt.

_Profit before Taxation_

Profit before taxation decreased by £2.4 million, or 11.0%, from £21.9 million for the year ended
31 December 2019 to £19.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. This decrease was mainly

TPI turnover increased by £20.9 million, or 31.7%, from £66.0 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £86.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by an
increase in AUA of £2.3 billion which led to an increase in platform fees, investment management fees
and performance fees, which are the main drivers of TPI Turnover.

_TPWM Turnover_

TPWM turnover increased by £3.4 million, or 6.9%, from £49.3 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £52.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by a
combination of increased adviser numbers and increased sales from the Central Advice Team.

TPAS turnover decreased by £0.5 million, or 8.9%, from £5.8 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £5.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This decrease is expected as it is part of
the business strategy to maintain a competitive structure and to channel target sales onto the TPI
platform.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £4.0 million, or 6.3%, from £63.0 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £67.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by the
increase of TPI Funds AUM resulting in an increase in sub-fund management fees by £3 million. The
following table presents a break-down of our cost of sales between TPI, TPWM, TPAS and TPA.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by £19.7 million, or 33.8%, from £58.2 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £77.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by the
growth seen in TPI turnover, while cost of sales remained similar to the prior year. This is a result of the
Central Advice Team’s contribution in TPWM, whereby fees are retained within the business instead of
being paid away to the Wealth Management Partners.

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses increased by £4.2 million, or 14.0%, from £30.0 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 to £34.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly
driven by a combination of the increase in staff numbers by 17, from 249 as at 31 December 2018 to
266 as at 31 December 2019, and IT outsourcing.

_Operating Profit before Goodwill Amortisation_

Operating profit before goodwill amortisation increased by £15.5 million, or 55.0%, from £28.2 million
for the year ended 31 December 2018 to £43.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This
increase was mainly driven by an increase in gross profits.

_Goodwill and Brand Amortisation_

Goodwill and brand amortisation remained stable at £15.4 million for the year ended 31 December
2019, as compared to the year ended 31 December 2018. This was consistent because of the 10-year
straight line amortisation policy.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by £15.5 million, or 121.1%, from £12.8 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 to £28.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly
driven by profits generated by TPI due to the lack of additional costs required to generate profits.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £17.1 million, or 58.0%, from £29.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018
to £46.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by the growth
seen in TPI, as a result of the central client advice contribution in TPWM, thereby allowing fees to be
retained within the business instead of being paid away to the TPWM advisers.

_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £6.3 million, from £0.1 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 to £6.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly
driven by an increase in debt of £360.7 million and partially due to an increase in the effective interest
rate.

_Profit before Taxation_

Profit before taxation increased by £9.2 million, or 72.4%, from £12.7 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 to £21.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly
driven by profits generated by TPI due to the lack of additional costs required to generate profits.

_Tax on Profit_

Tax on profit increased by £14.1 million, or 261.1%, from £5.4 million for the year ended 31 December
2018 to £19.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was mainly driven by our
trading performance, with profit before tax increased from £12.7 million to £21.9 million during this
period.

_Profit for the Period_

Profit for the period decreased by £4.9 million, or 66.7%, from £7.2 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 to £2.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This decrease was mainly
driven by a rise in tax.

**Financial Condition**

**_Capital Ratios_**

We are regulated by the FCA and The Pensions Regulator. Due to the regulatory regimes applicable
to our businesses, we are required to comply with certain liquidity standards and capital adequacy
requirements as outlined in the EU Capital Requirements Regulation No. 575/2013, as it forms part of
domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK
**CRR”) and the United Kingdom implementation of associated EU Capital Requirements Directives.**
Further to the UK’s exit from the EU, as an “investment firm”, we are subject to the UK Investment
Prudential Regime (“IFPR”) from 1 January 2022.


-----

**_Calculation of Capital Requirements and Risk Weighted Assets_**

We calculate our capital requirements for credit and counterparty risk, market risk and operational risk
in accordance with Article 95 of the UK CRR and applicable regulations, as described below.

In accordance with the guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory
review and evaluation process (SREP), the European Banking Authority tends to adopt a Pillar 1‐Plus
approach in assessing capital requirements under Pillar 2 when performing the supervisory review.
Under Pillar 1‐Plus the same risk categories covered at Pillar 2 and the total figure the Pillar 2a risk
amounts to can be no less than that at Pillar 1. If a Pillar 1 risk is assessed as being greater at Pillar 2,
then the amount in addition to Pillar 1 is added, at Pillar 2a, to the Pillar 1 minimum.

_TPI Credit and Counterparty Risk_

TPI income is derived primarily from management fees and platform fees. A negligible portion of
income is derived from invoiced services, generated by the investment management team; however,
credit risk is not material in regard to the income so derived.

TPI exposure to credit risk results from UK credit institutions with whom TPI places its corporate cash
balances and settlement of market transactions (the intercompany balance arrangements are
discussed in an earlier section, as a 100% risk weighted credit risk consideration). TPI continually
reviews both its corporate cash balances and client money counterparties with whom it is placed to
ensure sufficient capital strength of the bank and is a key control as part of our client money and asset
oversight with credit exposure information for credit institutions used for both corporate cash balances
and segregated client money bank accounts reported to the CASS Committee monthly, following
regular due diligence reports and credit rating assessments.

_Capital Requirement_

As an investment firm with limited authorisation to provide investment services, on an individual basis
and in accordance with Article 95 (2) of the UK CRR, TPI calculates total risk exposure as the “higher
of”:

- the risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk and dilution risk;

- the fixed overheads capital requirement;

- the base capital requirement of €125,000; or

- the cost for an orderly wind down.

TPI assessed the Pillar 1 capital requirement for the year ended 31 December 2020 as the higher value
of the risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk and dilution risk, at £15,916,225. TPI assessed
surplus capital at £118,742,029 and an overall CET1 Ratio and Capital Ratio of 67.68%.

**Amount as at**

**30 September 2021** **Method**

**Market Risk** nil We compute our capital requirements for market risk by using
the Pillar 1-Plus approach for Pillar 2. There is no market risk
because we don’t trade our own funds or capital, and therefore
at a firm level there is no exposure.

**Operational Risk** £0.4 million TPI has considered an additional Pillar 2a Operational Risk
requirement derived from prior year crystallised operational
losses and consideration of exposure to key operational risks,
internal and external fraud and operational scenarios.

TPI is authorised and regulated by the FCA as an IFPRU limited license firm, with capital requirements
derived from the UK CRR. The capital requirement for TPI is £22.0 million, and TPI had a surplus of
£190.0 million as at 30 September 2021.


-----

TPWM is regulated as a B3 personal investment firm, with capital requirements derived from the FCA
Interim Prudential sourcebook for Investment Businesses (IPRU-Inv). The capital requirement for
TPWM is £5.0 million, and TPWM had a surplus of £13.0 million as at 30 September 2021.

TPA is regulated as an authorised fund manager, with capital requirements stemming from higher of
funds under management requirement or the fixed overheads requirement. The capital requirement for
TPA is £3.4 million, and TPA had a surplus of £0.1 million as at 30 September 2021.

From 1 January 2022, the applicable regulatory capital requirements have changed to an IFPR regime,
and we will in the future report a consolidated capital position in addition to continuing to reporting on
an entity basis. The consolidated capital requirement is £14.0 million, and as at the Completion Date
we would have had a £6.0 million surplus under the IFPR regime.

**Operational Risk**

**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**

The Group retains sufficient liquidity to settle liabilities as they fall due. In order to monitor the Group’s
liquidity, ongoing monitoring is performed in the form of daily cash flow analysis and stress testing at a Group
and regulated entity level, as well as forward-looking analysis that is reported to the board of directors, all of
which continue to demonstrate a strong stable trend supported by the growth of the business.

**_Cash Flows_**

The table below shows selected cash flow statement information for the years ended 31 December
2018, 2019 and 2020 and the nine-month periods ended 30 September 2020 and 2021.

_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_

Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by TPI. These activities generate a high
cash conversion rate and EBITDA is converted to cash within 30 working days, with the exception of
the performance fee.

Cash flows from operating activities resulted in an inflow of £4.6 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2021, compared to an inflow of £13.2 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020. This movement was primarily due to the change in the working capital in 2020,
as a result of the payments made to a number of advisers who were recruited via our recruitment
programme.

Cash flows from operating activities resulted in an inflow of £107.6 million for the year ended
31 December 2020, compared to an inflow of £67.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019.

Cash flows from operating activities resulted in an inflow of £67.7 million for the year ended
31 December 2019, compared to an inflow of £22.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This
movement was primarily due to increase in creditors of £30.8 million.

_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_

Our cash flows from investing activities are primarily driven by the acquisition of client portfolios via
adviser recruitment.

Cash flows from investing activities resulted in an outflow of £59.5 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2021, compared to an outflow of £36.7 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020. This movement was primarily due to the acquisition of client portfolios via adviser
recruitment.

Cash flows from investing activities resulted in an outflow of £143.0 million for the year ended
31 December 2020, compared to an outflow of £95.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019.
This movement was primarily due to the acquisition of client portfolios via adviser recruitment.

Cash flows from investing activities resulted in an outflow of £95.3 million for the year ended
31 December 2019, compared to an outflow of £6.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This
movement was primarily due to the acquisition of client portfolios via adviser recruitment, as our
recruitment programme started the majority of its investing activities in 2019.

_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_

Our cash flows from financing activities are primarily driven by loans in order to acquire client portfolios
via adviser recruitment. Cash can be drawn ahead of recruitment and therefore can be held until
utilised.

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in an inflow of £83.7 million for the nine-month period
ended 30 September 2021, compared to an inflow of £37.0 million for the nine-month period ended
30 September 2020. This movement was primarily due to the use of client acquisition loans.

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in an inflow of £45.9 million for the year ended
31 December 2020, compared to an inflow of £39.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. This
movement was primarily due to the use of facility loans in order to acquire a large portion of shares
held by FTV in 2019 and the use of acquisition loans in 2020 to acquire client portfolios via adviser
recruitment.

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in an inflow of £39.2 million for the year ended
31 December 2019, compared to an outflow of £3.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This

movement was primarily due to the use of the facility loan in order to acquire a large portion of shares
held by FTV and acquire client portfolios via adviser recruitment.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

To support our business strategy and development plans, we regularly incur capital expenditures. The
following table presents our capital expenditures by period. Purchase of intangible fixed assets mainly
relate to business growth in the form of client acquisitions. Purchase of tangible fixed assets mainly
relate to maintenance.

For the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021, our purchase of intangible fixed assets primarily
related to the acquisition of client portfolios via adviser recruitment. Our purchase of tangible fixed
assets primarily related to office fit-out costs at £1.9 million and laptop purchases at £0.1 million.

For the year ended 31 December 2020, our purchase of intangible fixed assets primarily related to the
acquisition of client portfolios via adviser recruitment. Our purchase of tangible fixed assets primarily
related to computer equipment, predominantly laptop purchases at £0.1 million.

For the year ended 31 December 2019, our purchase of intangible fixed assets primarily related to the
acquisition of client portfolios via adviser recruitment. Our purchase of tangible fixed assets primarily
related to a hardware lease at £0.1 million, the Lombard lease, an operating lease for hardware such
as the server, at £0.5 million, and the remaining costs were related to laptops and computer equipment.

For the year ended 31 December 2018, our purchase of intangible fixed assets primarily related to
client acquisition, a part of the adviser recruitment programme where portfolios are bought at a
percentage of AUA, CASS project and Platform Project, a platform launched in 2018 that brought
in-house a previously outsourced service so that we can have more control over processes and save
on costs. Our purchase of tangible fixed assets primarily related to laptop purchases at £0.3 million
and an office fit-out at £0.1 million.

**Pension Scheme**

True Potential operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of pension costs is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.

**Off-Balance Sheet Items**

The Group does not have any material off balance sheet items.

**Qualitative Disclosure on Credit and Market Risk**

**_Credit risk_**

We have limited exposure to credit risk as all debtors are converted into cash within a short period of
time. Our main turnover streams (e.g. platform fees, investment management fees and advice fees) are
all paid within 30 days. Moreover, TPAS fees are paid on the day they are incurred. For adviser loan
payments, recoverability is monitored closely against asset values received to support loan payments
made.

**_Market Risk_**

The two main prevalent market risks are the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit.

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted commercial operations for much of the United Kingdom,
with monthly GDP consistently lower than previous years. Alongside this, record amounts of volatility
were reported in 2020 with both dramatic increases and decreases in equity markets. Moreover, the
realities of Brexit are starting to surface, with the latest examples being the fuel crisis, labour shortages
and product price increases.

Going forward these risks are being assessed, monitored and managed closely, both from an
operational and a financial perspective. We are maintaining operational resilience by ensuring that all
customer-facing and support staff can work remotely, with further steps in place for those working in
our offices to ensure social distancing.

**_Interest Rate and Price Risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risk on debt balances held. The Group mitigates this risk with an
interest rate cap against 40% of group borrowings at a LIBOR rate at 2.0%, in place to December 2022.
The directors believe that a low interest rate environment will persist and any rises in the future will be
gradual.

We manage exposure to price risk by completing detailed forecasting and through continuous
examination of both the trading marketplace and current economic climate.

**_Exchange Rate Risk_**

There is currently no exchange rate risk as we are solely UK-based.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

The Group is a highly cash generative business and retains sufficient cash balances to reduce
exposure to liquidity risk. Alongside this, to track the liquidity risk of the Group, constant monitoring
processes are performed including, but not limited to, daily checks of the leverage position and
production of detailed cash flow statements.

**_Operational Risk_**

Operational risk means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people
and systems or from external events, and includes legal risk. TPI has a low-risk appetite for operational
risk and seeks to mitigate risks through the continued development of robust infrastructure and
adherence to documented processes and controls, and enhancements to automated controls as
opposed to a reliance on manual controls. The effectiveness of internal controls is reviewed on a
risk-based approach and as part of the compliance monitoring plan. The compliance monitoring plan


-----

is a working paper that reflects the company’s assessment of current and future exposure to regulatory
risk on a recurring basis.

As TPI is at the forefront of cutting-edge technology in the financial services markets, this puts us at
risk of cyber-crime. TPI manage this risk with robust information security policies, procedures controls
and monitoring. TPI has in place business a continuity and disaster recovery plan which aims to ensure
that in the event of severe business disruption, the firm can operate on an ongoing basis, with the
preservation or restoration of key business services under interim arrangements, and that any losses
are limited.

There are risks associated with client redemptions and a reduction in fees earned by TPI as a firm
remunerated on funds under management. Charges that our clients pay for advice would also be
affected by a reduction in fees, as this is commonly a percentage of the value of the funds under
management. All funds operate under clear mandates governed by the products & investment team,
covering market, counterparty and liquidity risk, with outcomes of this due diligence being reported to
senior management. All funds are valued daily which helps increase identification and transparency of
risk positions. Monthly reporting and stress testing serve to highlight any issues with fund performance
to senior management, and regular performance attribution analysis provides insight into the drivers
of profits and loss.

Our internal operational risk teams are split between incident management and risk control
self-assessment (“RCSA”) implementation. In order to mitigate incidents in the future, we use an
in-house system for recording and tracking incidents then utilise an MI suite for the purpose of trend
analysis. The RCSAs plot every process and details the operational risk faced by the business if an
aspect of that process fails.

These systems are combined where the RCSA identifies the risk so we can set action plans to resolve
the incident. The management process directly links in to show where controls are starting to fail and
risks are materialising, and then evaluates the potential financial and reputational impact of such
incidents. As a result, we can now quickly identify any emerging trends and look to resolve them in a
much more efficient and effective way before issues become more widespread or have much
further-reaching consequences.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with UK GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of turnover, expenses, assets and
liabilities. The estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and contracted rates,
including expectation of future events that are believed to be reasonable.

The key estimates in preparing these financial statements are set out below.

**_Carrying Value of Intangibles_**

Intangible assets represent the value of the customer relationships purchased by the firm. In
calculating the value of the intangible asset to be capitalised, a conversion rate has been calculated
based on a historical average conversion observed on transactions completed by the year end date.
Conversion rates are adjusted to reflect updated actual experience at each reporting date and at the
date of completion of the purchase. Intangible asset balances are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation, where management determine their best estimate of the expected future value of the
asset.

Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment by the company. The potential impairment is
calculated as the expected future cash flows less the carrying value of the intangible asset at the
reporting date. Management is comfortable with the carrying value of intangible assets supported by
the future benefits of the client relationship.


-----

**_Useful Economic Life_**

Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful life. Future results are impacted by the
amortisation periods adopted, and potentially, may differ between expected and actual circumstances.

Management has considered the wider market and analysed the expected length of the client
relationship when determining the useful economic life.

**_Carrying Value of Investments_**

Investments values are reviewed annually for impairment by the company. The investment value is
calculated as the expected future cash flows.

**_Debtors Due after More than One Year_**

Debtors due after more than one year represent the value of loans advanced to new True Potential
Wealth Management advisers based on the value of assets transferred, recognised at transaction cost.
Management closely monitors the recoverability of these loans and consider the risk of default on
repayment to be very low. The loans are only advanced as the assets are transferred and management
has comfort over the value of asset received to support the loan payments. Robust compliance
monitoring of the adviser is in place to ensure that the advisers are fit and proper to continue to provide
advice and service to clients. Management will continue to monitor the recoverability of the loans
closely. Where the amount of debtors due after more than one year is so material in the context of the
total net current assets, it is disclosed on the face of the statement of financial position to prevent
misinterpretation.

**_Performance Fee_**

The performance fee is recognised on an accruals basis when it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to the entity. The recognition of the performance fee is subject to management’s
comfort around:

- the length of time to the fund year end;

- significant growth over the high-water mark; and

- an assessment of the equity and capital markets as well as the wider economy.

**Overall UK Wealth Market**

**_Overview_**

The United Kingdom has a potential addressable wealth market of £2.5 trillion (Source: Hardman & Co,
Platform Potential, May 2020), and is the fifth largest wealth market globally. The UK advised wealth
segment stands at £500 billion (Source: The Lang Cat), of which we hold approximately a 4% market
share (based on AUA of £18.8 billion as at 30 September 2021), which demonstrates the significant
headroom for us to continue growing our business. We have a market share under 0.5% of the current
UK D2C market of £165 billion (True Potential D2C AUM was £0.6 billion as at 30 September 2021),
and work with approximately 17% market share of UK advisers (based on approximately 27,000
financial advisers in the UK). (Source: FCA)

The wealth market in the United Kingdom can be sub-divided into four client segments (Source:
GlobalData’s Retail Investments Analytics, April 2021):

- Our retail client segment includes individuals with less than £100,000 investable assets. Although
this segment accounts for the vast majority (88%) of the adult population, the retail segment only
controls 29% of the wealth, which is primarily invested in pensions and ISAs and is therefore often
advised directly by the connected primary retail bank.

- The mass affluent segment covers 8% of the population, those within the £100,000 to £250,000
wealth band, and holds 20% of the wealth. Constituents of the mass affluent segment also invest
in ISAs and pensions, as well as unwrapped products, which are also quite standardised
products that require less complex advice.

- A smaller 3% of the population make up the affluent client segment, defined as individuals with
£250,000 to £1 million of investable assets, which holds 21% of the wealth. They also require
relatively standardised advice given the nature of their balanced investments across pensions,
ISAs and liquid assets.

- Finally, although the high net worth and ultra-high net worth categories account for less than 1%
of the population, they hold the largest share of wealth at 30%. These individuals focus on
equities, fixed income, cash and alternative investments, and allocate a lower proportion of their
wealth to pensions and ISAs, hence requiring bespoke advice through private banks or wealth
managers due to the complexity of these products.

In 2021, an estimated 46 million individuals made up the retail segment in which there is a substantial
level of auto-enrolment to ensure that savings and retirement needs are met. The mass affluent


-----

segment remains very fragmented, with approximately four million individuals who are serviced by
wealth managers, platforms and traditional life insurers. Finally, approximately 300,000 high net worth
and ultra-high net worth individuals, who have over £1 million in liquid assets, are generally served by
global private banks in the United Kingdom (Source: GlobalData’s Retail Investments Analytics, April
2021).

Wealth managers provide advice, platforms, investment management and wealth solutions. Some
firms target a specific segment of this value chain, while some firms pursue an integrated model with
provision of services across all aspects of the value chain. A broad categorisation of wealth managers
is listed below:

- Independent financial advice and advice-focused wealth managers primarily provide financial
advice and can be found in a range of different sizes from small independent financial advice firms
with a single adviser to larger network firms with 50+ advisers. These firms mainly focus on the
mass affluent and affluent client segments. Examples include Openwork, AFH Wealth
Management and Ascot Lloyd.

- Platforms provide an online service for financial advisers to manage their client’s investment
portfolios. The platforms are often based on a proprietary technology and offer a wide range of
portfolio solutions. Examples of these are Integrafin and AJ Bell.

- Discretionary wealth managers provide investment management services through which
investment decisions are made on the clients’ behalf. Through the provision of advice, platforms,
investment management and wealth solutions, they offer a broader service proposition and are
product and brokerage led. These firms focus on affluent and high net worth client segments.
Some examples are Brewin Dolphin, Investec, Rathbones and Tilney Smith & Williamson.

- Integrated wealth managers provide restricted advice, platform and investment management
thereby covering the entire value chain. Integrated managers typically originate clients and assets
under management by one of various channels. For example, St. James’s Place and Quilter focus
on originating assets under management by adding restricted advisers, which contrasts with
multi-channel integrated wealth managers such as True Potential, whose integrated business
model captures flows through multiple distribution channels: Wealth Management Partners,
Central Advice Team, TPAS and D2C. The flows sourced through these diverse channels are held
on the platform, which also houses the investment funds, hence allowing the wealth manager to
generate revenue across the whole value chain.

- D2C/Robo are self-directed digital platforms for do-it-yourself investing where no advice or
investment management service is provided, thus selling directly to the end client. Some
examples are Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell, Interactive Investor and Wealthify.


-----

True Potential's core market segments of D2C/Robo and financial advisers and networks are the
fastest-growing segments in the UK wealth management market. UK wealth management growth by
segment in terms of assets under administration from 2015 through 2020 (CAGR) is set out in the table

**_Market Trends_**

We expect the UK wealth market to continue to see growth and an increased demand for financial
advice as a result of several structural trends impacting the wealth management sector which have
been primarily driven by regulatory changes.

_Favourable Macro, Structural and Demographic Trends_

Wealth market flows (i.e. the net conversion of household deposit balances into financial assets) are
expected to grow driven by a long-term increase in the saver population segment (people from 30 to
60 years old). Moreover, the average life expectancy in the United Kingdom grew from 71 years in 1960
to 81 years in 2019 (Source: World Development Indicators) and the percentage of UK residents above
the age of 65 grew from 16% in 1999 to 20% in 2019 and is projected to reach 24% by 2039 (Source:
Office for National Statistics, January 2021). These factors have increased the saving requirements of
UK households.

We have surveyed over 50,000 people about the savings gap since 2013. The results show that only
a minority of savers will have enough funds to reach their financial goals. Our polling shows that people
expect they will need £23,000 a year in retirement to live comfortably. However, based on their actual
savings behaviour, UK citizens are on course to receive an income of just £6,000 per year from their
retirement fund. That leaves a savings gap of £17,000 every year. With such a significant shortfall, it is
clear that the UK needs to change the way it approaches its finances. We expect that this trend may
increase customers’ willingness to use wealth management products and rely on financial advice.

Furthermore, the ongoing shift from “defined benefit” to “defined contribution” pension plans is
projected to increase flows to the wealth management market. Defined benefit pension schemes are
considered traditional pension plans through which a specified payment amount is provided to
retirement. On the other hand, defined contribution schemes allow employees and employers
to contribute and invest funds at their discretion to save for retirement over time, allowing employers
to match the contributions that employees choose to allocate. The transition from defined benefit plans
to defined contribution plans over recent decades has shifted the responsibility of investing and saving
onto the client, rather than the employer, which has contributed to an increased demand for financial
advice. Additionally, following the introduction of the Pension Freedom legislative change in April 2015


-----

through the Pension Schemes Act 2015, those over the age of 55 have unrestricted access to their
pensions. As a result, savers are no longer required to purchase an annuity with their retirement fund
but instead have a variety of options as to how they can access their retirement income, hence also
presenting customers with an increased level of responsibility.

Finally, the attention to investing and saving was strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
increased families’ need to be financially stable. Household savings increased as a drop in household
spending was experienced, while household incomes remained reasonably stable as a result of
government policy, including the “Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme”. Analysis from the Bank of
England in November 2020 suggested that the accumulation of savings was particularly observed
among wealthier and less financially distressed households. Therefore, the pandemic spurred
long-term trends and urged many of these savers to invest for the first time in their lives. This
subsequently entailed an acceleration in the trend for increased on-demand advice.

_Government Policy Initiatives_

The growing demand for wealth management products and financial advice has also been driven by
government policies and regulatory changes, among which are the pension reforms, the tax relief on
private pension contributions under certain conditions, particularly the Pension Freedom legislative
change in 2015. The latter legislation allows clients to flexibly obtain their defined contribution pension
pots when they are 55 years old and use the funds to select from a broad set of investment
opportunities and retirement income products.

The government has also continued to adapt to consumers’ needs and the macro environment. The
introduction of Lifetime ISAs is a good example. Despite the fact that ISAs are a settled piece of the UK
savings landscape since their introduction in 1999, the government has continued to expand their
offering. In 2017, a new form of ISA named “Lifetime ISA” was created to help individuals get on to the
property ladder or save for retirement, where the Government applies a bonus of 25% to any money
deposited.

_Ongoing Regulatory Focus_

Regulators strengthened their approach to financial services regulation after the financial crisis of
2007-2008.

In the United Kingdom, the FCA aimed specifically at granting good customer outcomes by
introducing the RDR in 2013. MiFID II was introduced on 3 January 2018 to implement changes in
different areas of financial markets with a particular attention to conflicts of interest. Increased
disclosure requirements regarding costs and charges were introduced with MiFID II providing more
clarity to end clients. Finally, several market studies and thematic reviews have been carried out by the
FCA to assess the wealth asset management industry in the United Kingdom with the aim of improving
the transparency of customer’s fees and promoting the fair treatment of clients.

_Changing Customer Behaviour and Preferences_

Customer behaviour and preferences have experienced a shift over the last few years as digitalisation
has increased the need for ease of access and interaction via online or digital interfaces, for example,
websites and most recently, mobile applications. In the United Kingdom, the FinTech adoption rate,
which is defined as the percentage of consumers using technology to manage their finances, reached
86% in 2021, having been only 14% in 2015 (Source: Plaid). Those born after 1980, referred to as
‘millennials’, particularly display this trend due to their differing preferences compared to previous
generations. Given the expected wealth transfer to millennials of approximately £920 billion from those
aged over 55 to younger generations, they are becoming an increasingly prominent segment (Source:
Capital Economics, St. James’s Place). The COVID-19 pandemic led to an acceleration of this preexisting trend for increased on-demand advice. As a consequence, the increased focus on digital has
also brought to light the importance of cybersecurity and data protection, which is an increased area
of focus for the vast majority of companies.

**UK Advice Market**

**_Overview_**

In the United Kingdom, the number of firms providing financial advice contracted slightly from 5,218 in
2016 to 5,137 in 2020. The number of advisers, however, grew at a CAGR of approximately 2%
between 2016 and 2020, standing at 27,501 at the end of 2020 (Source: FCA).

Financial advisers solely focus on providing financial advice and recommendations in accordance with
their client’s risk appetite and financial objectives, and hence do not have a mandate to buy, sell or
execute investment decisions on a discretionary basis. Financial advisers provide planning and advice
services that include wealth and investments, retirement, tax, estate and inheritance. Certain mortgage
and protection advisers in the United Kingdom also provide specialised advice on mortgage
applications and life insurance products. Financial advisers are increasingly acting as a “one-stopshop” by providing a range of services from portfolio management to insurance products.

As described by the FCA, there are two different types of financial advisers — independent and
restricted. Independent financial advisers provide unrestricted advice to recommend a wide range of
retail investment products in order to meet the client’s needs and financial objectives. On the other
hand, restricted advisers are limited to a specific selection of products or products from a narrow
selection of providers. Regulations are more stringent in the case of restricted advice and require the
adviser or firm to clearly explain to the customer the nature of the restriction of the advice. Restricted
advisers and firms cannot describe the advice they offer as “independent”. According to Platforum,
there continues to be a slight shift towards restricted advice as the proportion of restricted advisers has
increased from 34% in 2015 to 38% in 2019.

Furthermore, the introduction of the RDR in 2013 introduced the need for fee charges, usually as a
percentage of assets under advice, in exchange for advice as opposed to through commissions.
Before the implementation of RDR, in 2012, net commission income comprised 84% of total advice
income from retail investments in the United Kingdom, whereas only 11% was fee income (Source:
APFA). Following RDR, the customer model shifted entirely. In 2019, the proportion of net commission
income significantly decreased to 16% of total advice revenue in the United Kingdom, but fee income
rose to 82% (Source: Platforum, FCA Retail Intermediary Market 2019). RDR served to ensure greater
transparency in the investment industry and to increase the understanding of costs associated with
advice.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

The financial advice market is served by an intersection of wealth management firms. A small number
of integrated wealth managers dominate the UK advice sector: namely St. James’s Place, Quilter and
Tilney Smith & Williamson (Source: Financial Times), who all offer expert financial planning and advice
services. St. James’s Place services a broad spectrum of individuals (mass affluent, to affluent and
some high net worth) in the United Kingdom with restricted financial advisers, whilst Tilney Smith &
Williamson are available to private clients, their business interests and professionals, and Quilter
particularly caters to the affluent client segment but also serves high net worth individuals. Hargreaves
Lansdown also entered the advice market more recently, with 61 financial advisers spread across the
United Kingdom, as well as offering telephone advice.

On the other hand, there are specialised companies offering competing products with different value
propositions. For instance, Schroders Personal Wealth provides a bank-led offering solely focused on
the advice sub-market, through a partnership between Schroders and Lloyds Banking Group. The joint
venture seeks to grant more customers with access to financial and investment expertise and is
available to those with at least £100,000 in sole annual income, or £100,000 spread across sole or joint
savings, investments and personal pensions.

We also see smaller Independent Financial Adviser firms, representing the long tail of a fragmented
market.


-----

As at December 2020, the total number of financial advice firms in the United Kingdom stood at 5,137,
with 27,501 financial advisers. (Source: FCA). In 2018, these figures stood at 5,218 financial advice
firms and 25,611 financial advisers (Source: Platforum UK Financial Advisers, November 2020).
Despite the observable consolidation, the UK advice market continues to be highly fragmented, and in
2020 there were only 48 financial advice firms with over 50 financial advisers (Source: FCA) and only
two firms with more than 1,000 advisers (Source: Financial Times).

**_Market Trends_**

_Increasing Need for Financial Advice_

The last decade has brought increased responsibility for UK citizens regarding their long-term and
retirement savings. As detailed above, this shift has been exacerbated by (i) the demographic curve
transitioning to an ageing population and (ii) regulatory trends shifting the burden of investing and
saving to the consumer. By observing the number of advisers in the industry and the number of clients
receiving ongoing advice, it can be noted that the number of clients per adviser has steadily increased
over recent years, from 86 in 2016 to 106 in 2019 (Source: Platforum UK Financial Advisers, November
2020 FCA, The Retail Intermediary Market 2019, July 2020). This again highlights the imbalance
between the supply and demand of financial advice.

_Ageing Adviser Population_

The average age of independent financial advisers in the United Kingdom is 58 with one in five advisers
planning to retire in the next five years (Source: The Private Office, 2020). Moreover, some advisers are
qualified individuals who are not allowed to advise retail customers. In this situation, quality advice is
a scarce resource. Given the increasing demand for financial advice yet the slower increase in adviser
supply, an exacerbated gap between supply and demand may be observed in coming years.

_Impacts of RDR and Other Regulatory Changes to the Market for Financial Advice_

The implementation of RDR resulted in platforms only receiving remuneration through the fees paid by
investors instead of earning a commission fee from the sale of recommended products. In addition,
this led to far more transparency regarding the services offered by the adviser, the fund manager and
the investment platform, and what each respective party receives for its services. A further
consequence of the RDR was the stricter definition of independent and restricted advisers, causing
more advisers to be identified as restricted rather than independent.

The introduction of RDR led to a greater number of consumers being unable to access or afford
financial advice, therefore leading to an expansion of the possible D2C investment market. Moreover,
the regulatory cost of providing advice to consumers has risen, which has resulted in numerous
advisers moving funds to adviser platforms that have all the features to be RDR compliant.
Consolidation in the market has also been a consequence of the higher overhead and regulatory
costs.

_Focus on Suitability and Disclosure_

The FCA puts a lot of attention on customers’ fair outcomes and on the suitability of advice provided
to customers through COBS.

COBS 6.1A contains rules on adviser charging and remuneration that apply to firms making personal
recommendations to retail clients in relation to retail investment products and certain other products in
the United Kingdom. In particular, a firm must only be remunerated for a personal recommendation
and any other related services by adviser charges, and must not solicit or accept any other
commissions, remuneration or benefit of any kind in connection with the firm’s business of advising,
regardless of whether it intends to refund the payments or pass the benefits on to the retail client. An
appropriate charging structure for calculating the adviser charge must be used.

COBS 6.2B contains rules on describing advice services that apply to firms providing investment
advice to retail clients in the United Kingdom in relation to financial instruments, structured deposits or


-----

other retail investment products or basic advice to retail clients in the United Kingdom (as well as to
firms providing investment advice in the course of MiFID business in relation to financial instruments
and structured deposits, since COBS 6.2B also implements aspects of MiFID II). In particular, firms
holding themselves out as providing independent advice must assess a sufficient and diverse range of
relevant products available on the market. A firm must also disclose to a client whether its advice will
be independent advice or restricted advice, whether the advice will be based on a broad or more
restricted analysis of different types of relevant products and whether the range will be limited to
relevant products issued or provided by entities having close links or relationships with the firm.

_Increasing Penetration of Technology_

There is increasing evidence that advisers are embracing technology to improve their efficiency.
Advisers are looking at back-office systems, automated client communications to improve interactions
and more purpose-built suitability. Some of this has been prompted by regulation – specifically MiFID
II – and the additional constraints that this has placed on advisers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also
acted as a catalyst as advisers have had to do more remotely.

**UK Retail Platform Market**

**_Overview_**

As defined by the FCA, an investment platform arranges, safeguards and administers investments on
behalf of consumers and provides access to retail investment products from several different providers,
and is therefore an entity between funds and investors. As a popular means for financial planning, retail
platforms provide customers and financial advisers an interface through which they are able to view,
manage and administer investments online. Customers are able to use platforms in order to access
information and tools that inform them in making investment decisions. As such, with regards to
customers, platforms generally offer access to online valuations and financial information, they
facilitate the consolidation of investment holdings and provide tax efficient products, customer services
and performance tracking. On the other hand, platforms offer advisers back office and technical
support, aggregate customer relationships in a single interface and reporting services.

Platforms increasingly form a central part of the retail distribution landscape and have steadily grown
as a sector over the last decade, capturing a substantial share of UK retail savings and pension flows.
The total UK platform market has recorded a year-on-year growth of 9% from £546 billion of assets
under administration as at 31 December 2019, to £594 billion as at 31 December 2020 (Source:
Platforum: UK Adviser Platforms Market Overview, March 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively
impacted financial advisers in 2020 and accordingly, platforms experienced a downturn in new
business during the second and third quarters of 2020, a period that would have otherwise
experienced much stronger flows (Source: Platforum: UK Adviser Platforms Market Overview, March
2021).

Platforms can be extremely valuable due to the exposure to markets granted through the provision of
access to investment products. The platform market can be sub-divided into three segments (i) the
retail advised platforms that play an intermediary role between financial advisers and customers,
(ii) the corporate and institutional platforms that are mainly used by discretionary fund managers,
employee benefit consultants and workplace pension providers and (iii) D2C platforms allow
customers to directly invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investment products on their own
account. Each of these segments has grown over the last few years. Within the retail advised segment,
the open market channel and the advised channel provide two different sources of fund flows. The
open market channel allows third-party independent financial advisers to direct flows onto the platform,
while the advised channel has requests for proposals linked to the platform provider direct flows.

Out of the three sub-segments, the most relevant when considering True Potential is the retail advised
segment. This segment had £496 billion of assets under administration as at 31 December 2020, which
represents 63% of total assets under administration, also Gross Asset Inflows of £59 billion,
representing approximately 46% of total Gross Asset Inflows. Secondly, the corporate and institutional


-----

market segment had £123 billion of assets under administration, 16% of total assets under
administration as at 31 December 2020 and with £42 billion of Gross Asset Inflows, which translates to
33% of total Gross Asset Inflows. Finally, D2C had £165 billion of assets under administration, 21% of
total assets under administration, and £26 billion of Gross Asset Inflows for 2020, 21% of total Gross
Asset Inflows (Source: Fundscape Platform Report, Q4 2020).

In the United Kingdom, retail platforms can be divided into the “wrappers” or the “non-wrapped” subsegments. ISAs, personal pension plans, such as flexible drawdown and Self-Invested Personal
Pensions and investment bonds are all considered tax-efficient “wrappers”. Non-wrapped products, in
contrast, include general investment accounts, which are most commonly used by customers once
their tax-free ISA allowance has been utilised. Self-Invested Personal Pensions were the largest
proportion of Gross Asset Inflows on platforms in 2020, accounting for 45% of assets under
administration. Non-wrapped products were 25%, ISAs were 24% and defined contribution pensions
were 6% (Source: Fundscape Platform Report, Q4 2020). 92% of the True Potential offerings are
wrapped.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

The UK retail platform market is comprised of both integrated incumbents as well as those who are
focused exclusively on the platform sub-market. The largest retail advised platforms are Abrdn, Quilter
and Aegon with £72 billion, £69 billion and £55 billion of assets under administration, respectively. The
next six largest platforms have between £25 billion and £50 billion assets under administration (Source:
Fundscape Q2 2021). Out of ten largest platforms, the tenth being True Potential, only half have their
own advisers (Abrdn, Quilter, Fidelity, Aviva and True Potential); the others rely on independent
financial advisers.

The largest companies solely focused on the retail platform market are Aegon, Transact and Integrafin,
who all offer technology, support, services and investments to their clients. Aegon, Transact and
Integrafin have £55 billion, £50 billion and over £40 billion assets under administration, respectively
(Source: Fundscape Q2 2021). On the other hand, Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell, who are
specialised in this part of the value chain, offer D2C platforms with technology, customer services,
stocks, ISAs, pension solutions and investment solutions. In addition to these specialised providers,
Rathbones also launched its MyRathbones platform in July 2020.

Conversely, Abrdn, Aviva, Fidelity, Quilter, Hargreaves Lansdown and True Potential are examples of
integrated wealth managers that also offer a platform to their clients. These platforms have a wide
offering ranging from tailored services and technology to portfolios, investment solutions, financial
planning, financial advice, ISAs and pension solutions. In 2020, M&G entered the platform market
when M&G Wealth acquired the platform Ascentric, bringing it together with their in-house adviser arm
(Prudential Financial Planning) and network (The Advice Partnership).

**_Market Trends_**

_Platforms Capturing Majority of Retail Flows_

As interfaces that provide a tax-efficient way of holding investments with access to a wide fund range,
UK Platforms have been a key way for UK investors to access investment products every year for the
past decade and provided the majority of access for UK investors in 2020 with a net £16.3 billion inflow
(The Investment Association, September 2021). This reflects a trend in the market centred around
customers who are granted a greater degree of flexibility and are able to consolidate maturing
investments from more traditional pensions or savings products. In 2015, the Pension Freedom
legislation gave those over 55 years of age increased flexibility around when and how they are able to
monetise their defined contribution pension savings. Subsequently, pension savers were no longer
required to purchase an annuity for retirement, but instead had the flexibility to withdraw pension
savings. These reforms also led to increased decumulation product offerings that are available on UK
retail platforms in order to convert pension savings to retirement income. The transition over the past
few decades has seen a shift from traditional defined-benefit plan to the more contemporary defined
contribution plan, contributing to the growing fund flows onto platforms.


-----

_Differentiated Competitive Strategies_

As the sector continues to face substantial competition on pricing, leading to significant margin
pressure, some companies have tried to capture market share by offering a more comprehensive
product offering, or by enhancing their platform with other features. Value-added features that address
advisers’ and clients’ needs can represent a source of competitive advantage. For instance, some
platforms, alongside their standard proposition, also offer further technology-enabled services that
improve efficiency and client engagement, such as integrated technology that coordinates with clients
and head office to book appointments or access live chat. In the case of integrated players, these
additional features also help them secure flows across their entire value chain into multi-asset
solutions.

_Re-platforming_

The continuous introduction of new products, as well as the numerous changes in regulation, have led
various platforms to undertake various technology upgrades, also named replatforming. While some
replatforming exercises have been successful, others have not; for instance, in recent years, Aegon,
Ascentric and Aviva were all hit by glitches when moving to new software, resulting in issues with client
reports and logging on to the platforms. Despite the inherent operational risk of these upgrades, they
are becoming customary given the need to match the requirements and requests of clients and
advisers.

_Consolidation_

There are currently over 20 retail platforms in the United Kingdom with different levels of scale in terms
of assets under administration. A growing trend of consolidation prevails in the platform sector. Recent
transactions include AXA UK selling its Elevate platform to Standard Life, Aegon acquiring the Cofunds
platform from Legal & General and Lloyds Banking Group acquiring Zurich’s workplace pensions
intermediary platform. Cost efficiency and overall benefits of scale remain the primary drivers of
consolidation. Market commentators, including Calastone, believe there will likely be further
consolidation in the years ahead as a response to competitive dynamics and continued regulatory
burdens.

_FCA Investment Platforms Market Study_

In 2017, the FCA launched a market study that delved into the retail investment platforms market in the
United Kingdom following the increasing regulatory pressures across the wealth management value
chain. The report set out to analyse the impact of the platforms industry on competition in the United
Kingdom, and to assess whether the incumbents were working in the interests of investors. In their
2018 interim report, the FCA found the market to be functioning well for both advised and non-advised
consumers, with a high level of customer satisfaction. Those who pay more for platform services
generally have greater functionality. The concern for competition was reiterated, specifically including
the following points:

- Switching between platforms is quite challenging, so those who would benefit from doing so
suffer.

- Shopping around is also difficult and there are consumers who need to be able to find a
lower-cost platform.

- Consumers who hold large cash balances on D2C platforms may not be aware of the investment
returns, interest lost or charges paid they are overlooking.

- There is a lack of transparency and clarity surrounding the risks and expected returns that
consumers face using model portfolios.

- “Orphan clients” are those who were previously advised and no longer have a relationship with a
financial adviser and face the issue of higher charges and lower service.


-----

Rules introduced under MiFID II were believed to help in tackling the above concerns but additional
measures may be required to strengthen and drive competition. In their 2019 Final Report, the FCA
finalised their proposed solutions to ensure that both consumers and advisers are able to shop around
and switch with ease, at a low cost, when an alternative provider is better suited to their needs. Upon
assessment, the FCA proposed that exit fees be restricted through a cap or a ban, as well as
introducing rules for facilitating the switch of consumers’ investments between platforms without the
need for a cash out. The FCA will subsequently continue to monitor the industry to ensure progress
and potentially intervene further if necessary.

**Investment Solutions**

In a discretionary fund management (“DFM”) mandate, all investment and portfolio asset allocation
decisions are under the full responsibility of an investment manager who is completely authorised by
the client and manages the portfolio according to the client’s preferences.

DFM usually offers two portfolios:

- Managed Portfolio Service: designed to address the affluent market, these products are managed
by the investment manager and are risk-based model portfolios,

- Bespoke Discretionary portfolios: designed for high net worth clients, these portfolios are
specifically tailored and unique for each different client.

The distribution channel for DFM usually includes direct sales to customers or a financial adviser
marketing the products. However, recently DFM products are available also through platforms.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

The UK DFM sub-market is composed of companies that specialise in this segment as well as
integrated wealth managers. Regarding the wealth managers that solely focus on providing DFM in the
United Kingdom, the three largest are Brewin Dolphin with £50 billion assets under management (as
at 30 September 2021), Rathbones with £48 billion assets under management (as at 30 June 2021),
and Investec Wealth & Investment with £45 billion assets under management (as at 30 September
2021). Alongside DFM, Rathbones and Brewin Dolphin provide investment and wealth management
services, including financial planning, ISAs and multi-asset funds. Furthermore, Investec Wealth &
Investment offers a bespoke discretionary managed investment service.

When considering the integrated wealth managers who also offer investment solutions to their clients,
the leading companies are Tilney Smith & Williamson, Quilter, St James’s Place and True Potential.
These companies give clients access to discretionary portfolios, bespoke services and investment
management solutions, in addition to financial advice and direct access to equities, ISAs and pension
solutions. Quilter provides investment solutions through Quilter Cheviot and Quilter Investors, and
offers dedicated investment managers, while St. James’s Place hires external managers to manage
their range of funds.

**_Market Trends_**

_Increasing Demand for Sophisticated Solutions_

Financial advisers in the United Kingdom started outsourcing fund selection and investment
management after the introduction of RDR in order to better oversee advice risk and provide fair
customer outcomes. The new compliance costs linked to portfolio construction and advisory services
are not feasible for many small financial advisory firms. Hence, risk-based multi-asset solutions and
discretionary outsourcing are becoming an optimal choice for advisers to decrease their exposure to
the risks arising from the new regulations.

The current market environment where interest rates remain low has led investors to broaden their
portfolios and search for higher-yielding, risk-adjusted investment products. As a consequence, the


-----

simple balanced equity and bond portfolios have evolved into more sophisticated investment
strategies, including a more frequent use of alternative investments.

Finally, a fundamental demand for decumulation and income products to support retirees in the
drawdown phase started after the end of compulsory annuitisation and the introduction of Pension
Freedom. Data gathered by the FCA shows that after the two reforms, income drawdown accounted
for 76% of retirement income sales compared to only 19% in the previous periods.

_FCA Focus on Customer Outcomes and the Fair Treatment of Customers_

The FCA puts a lot of attention on customers’ fair outcomes and on fair treatment of clients in the
wealth and asset management industry. As multi-assets products are created for unique client needs
following their risk appetite, they are considered to be more transparent and thus demand for this type
of products has grown substantially, providing higher flows and assets under management.

_Rise of Passive Investment Strategies and Ongoing Fee Compression_

While investment markets have generally experienced sustained growth in recent years, many active
funds have not performed as well as passive investments, which has led some UK investors to
increasingly focus on fees and related expenses and in turn favour lower fee passive investment
products. As a consequence, passive funds constituted 31% of assets under management in the
United Kingdom in 2020 and are likely to grow further, compared to 26% of assets under management
in 2017. (Source: The Investment Association, September 2021 and September 2018). Moreover, the
increasing adoption of technology and the growth of digital advisers have further driven the demand
for passive investment products. This is expected to lead to lower levels of fees in the asset
management industry and could possibly result in the consolidation of smaller players as scale
becomes increasingly important. Moreover, investment managers who place a greater focus on
cost-efficient passive products are gaining market share. However, this migration to passive investing
is occurring at a slower rate in the retail wealth compared to the institutional investor pools and is
favoured by the younger investors who have a far lower level of assets under management than the
older investors who are less inclined to switch to passive investing. While we believe there will continue
to be demand in the United Kingdom for strong performing active management at attractive pricing,
we cannot predict how much market share competitors offering passive investment products will gain.

_Declining Revenue and Profitability Margins in DFM Segment_

DFMs were forced to change their revenue model after RDR from trail and rebate income to a fee
structure normally based on total portfolio value. The low yield ecosystem has also affected fee margin
lowering profitability especially for smaller firms which may not be efficient enough to sustain such low
prices.

_Consolidation in a Saturated DFM market_

In an attempt to increase their share of the market as well as their distribution competitiveness, the UK
DFM sector has already experienced consolidation. The underlying rationale for players choosing to
combine is that of cost. In fact, smaller firms in the sector are unable to benefit from any economies of
scale, as well as being faced with higher capital adequacy requirements. The increasing speed with
which companies need to adopt technological solutions and increased regulatory burdens have
contributed to these costs, hence further perpetuating this trend of consolidation.

###### OUR BUSINESS

_This business section includes certain technical terms that are commonly used in our industry. See_
_“Glossary of Asset Management Terms” for a detailed explanation of these terms._

**Overview**

True Potential is a fully integrated technology-led wealth manager, serving investors and advisers
across the United Kingdom. Total AUA on our platform as at 30 September 2021 were approximately
£18.8 billion, of which £16.5 billion were AUM, which are assets invested in our range of exclusive
investment funds. With our strong heritage in the North East of England, we have expanded, since
inception in 2007, to become one of the fastest growing financial services businesses in the United
Kingdom, employing approximately 380 full-time staff and working with approximately 4,500 financial
advisers. We provide financial advice, investment platform services and portfolio investment solutions
to UK retail clients.

Our aim is to revolutionise the way wealth management is delivered. We believe that by using
technology to deliver financial services, we empower financial advisers and their clients to take control
of their futures. By providing what we call “hybrid advice”, blending technology with expert financial
advice, we are able to offer clients the access and support they need 24/7, while ensuring that they
have an adviser to speak to whenever needed.

We are privileged to work with approximately 17% of UK financial advisers and their clients through
either our fully integrated model or through our software offering, meaning we can have a real impact
on how UK households invest their money and save for retirement.

We grow through accelerated adviser recruitment and client and AUM acquisition. We offer certain
advisers seeking capital to fund their growth a loan of 2% of their total assets under management when
they become Wealth Management Partners. Our recruitment programmes have contributed to rapid
growth in our AUM from £6.0 billion as at 31 December 2018 to £16.5 billion in our own funds as at
30 September 2021.

True Potential is primarily made up of the following businesses:

- TPI, which provides our purpose-built, in-house proprietary wealth management platform and our
own exclusive investment fund range;

- TPWM, which is our wealth management advice proposition with 844 self-employed Wealth
Management Partners as well as our 40-member in-house Central Advice Team;

- TPAS, which provides technology, adviser support and compliance services to approximately 598
financial advice firms with approximately 3,600 individual advisers representing more than one
million clients; and

- TPA, which is the in-house ACD for the TPI Funds.

As a fully integrated wealth manager participating in all parts of the value chain, we service all stages
of the wealth management process. We benefit from synergies across our ecosystem, with our
distribution, investment management and technology capabilities complementing each other. Our fully
integrated ecosystem enables and benefits from a multi-channel distribution model with multiple fee
streams. New investments pass through the True Potential platform and are invested in our ten True
Potential Portfolios, enabling us to capture economies across the value chain. Our multiple distribution
channels include (i) our wealth management advice channel TPWM, (ii) our adviser support services
channel TPAS and (iii) a D2C and auto-enrolment pension channel, where clients do not receive
financial advice. Assets that originated via these distribution channels then flow primarily to TPI, where
they are held and managed. Our multiple fee streams in TPI include (i) platform fees, (ii) fund fees and
(iii) performance fees, while TPWM also benefits from financial advice fees and TPAS also generates
revenue from service fees.


-----

Our revenue has become increasingly diversified across channels, resulting in robust AUA and AUM
expansion, supported by a growing recruitment programme that has led to double-digit revenue
growth and margin expansion. From 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, AUA on the True
Potential platform increased by £11.1 billion, or 143.6%, and AUM invested in TPI Funds increased by
£10.6 billion, or 177.3%. Our Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021 was
£165.3 million, which was generated from gross revenue of £260.4 million, and our EBITDA was
£122.6 million, representing an EBITDA Margin of 74.2% and an EBITDA CAGR of 67.8% from
31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended
30 September 2021 was £160.0 million.

Gross Asset Inflows grew from £2.2 billion in 2018 to £4.2 billion in 2020 to £4.9 billion in the nine
months ended 30 September 2021. Over recent years, organic growth has been the “traditional” route
for Gross Asset Inflows through adviser and productivity growth and remains a strong underpin. The
majority of Gross Asset Inflows in 2018 and 2019 came from organic channels, most notably through
TPWM, which accounted for approximately 52% in 2018 and approximately 40% in 2019, and TPAS,
which represented approximately 43% in 2018 and 24% in 2019. In recent years, management has
been reinvesting cash flows into various recruitment initiatives, increasing the level of inorganic growth
given the market opportunity.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Fully integrated business model drives capture of top of funnel flows and provides a competitive_**
**_edge_**

We have developed a full suite of capabilities across the value chain, all underpinned by a proprietary,
purpose-built and innovative technology platform that allows us to drive superior financial
performance.

The top of funnel flows are sourced through three distribution channels – (i) our wealth management
advice channel TPWM; (ii) our adviser support services channel TPAS; and (iii) a D2C and
auto-enrolment pension channel. These assets are held on the True Potential platform and are primarily
invested into TPI Funds held on this platform with a smaller portion of the AUA held in third-party funds.
As a consequence, we have well-diversified revenue attributable to the three distribution channels and
we earn fees across the whole value chain: advice, platform and investment management fees.

Each of our capabilities servicing the wealth management value chain has differentiating attributes,
such as:

- Advice: an at-scale national firm of advisers comprising a team of 844 Wealth Management
Partners and 40 Central Advice Team members, providing advice on True Potential’s investment
proposition.

- Platform: innovative platform seamlessly integrated with advice offering and unified with
investment solutions. The platform has won many awards over the years, most recently the UK
Platform Awards 2021, where True Potential’s platform was voted as the Best Platform Service and
Best Platform Provider.

- Investment solutions: offering competitively priced investment products that provide multi-layered
diversification and attractive risk adjusted returns. Recently, TPI has been named ‘Best for Digital
ISAs’ in the ‘Best Buys 2021 Awards’ by Boring Money.

The proportion of Integrated Flows, calculated as TPI flows divided by total flows, which increased from
89.3% in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 93.0% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September
2021, clearly demonstrates how unique our business model is. Even in absolute terms, Integrated
Flows have increased materially from £2.2 billion in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £6.3 billion
in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021, representing a CAGR of 46.6%. The full
integration of True Potential’s business model allows us to offer clients significantly lower fees than
our main competitors, while maintaining strong profitability. While integrated solutions providers


-----

(e.g. St. James’ Place ISA/Unit Trust and Pension, Quilter PCA and Hargreaves Lansdown), wealth
managers (e.g. Schroders Personal Wealth, Rathbones and Brewin Dolphin) and independent financial
advice firms (i.e. firms representing a typical UK independent financial adviser charging structure and
having more than five advisers) charge all-in fees of approximately 2.3%, 2.3% and 2.0%, respectively,
True Potential charges clients all-in fees of approximately 1.7% of the amount invested.

Our £18.8 billion of AUA, of which 88% is AUM held in TPI Funds, and our network of 844 Wealth
Management Partners give us significant scale to operate in a very competitive market environment.
Additionally, the proprietary purpose-built technology platform operated by True Potential is already
used by approximately 17% of the total UK adviser population. Finally, we are fully licensed as a fund
manager (TPA), platform operator, investment manager, and pension operator and administrator (all
within TPI), and for advisory services (within TPWM). These attributes together underpin the significant
differentiation of our unique competitive strength.

**_High-quality, sticky adviser and client relationships drive high levels of recurring revenue_**

The differentiated technology and strong product set we offer have allowed us to attract and retain
productive advisers. This technology proposition offers full-spectrum support to advisers, driving
adviser productivity and satisfaction. Moreover, we leverage strong technology in the recruitment
process as this facilitates fast onboarding and, where required, a seamless asset transfer process.

We have also developed a structured recruitment process and targeted programmes, which allowed
us to rapidly expand our adviser firm from 456 advisers as at 31 December 2018 to 844 as at
30 September 2021, representing cumulative growth of more than 94%.

We have received consistent recognition from our adviser base for our platform quality, service ratings
and value for money propositions. In the Lang Cat Platform Analyser (Adviser Briefing, Issue Three:
June 2020), True Potential ranked:

- #1 for overall platform, achieving an NPS score of 4.48 (compared to the market average of 3.85);

- #1 for service rating, achieving an NPS score of 4.56 (compared to the market average of 3.59);
and

- #3 for value of fees charged, achieving an NPS score of 4.31 (compared to the market average
of 3.90).

The aforementioned high levels of satisfaction amongst advisers translate to sticky end clients,
demonstrated by our AUA retention rate of 93.4% over the last twelve months ended 30 September
2021. The highest retention rate is observed amongst clients who were transferred with advisers hired
under our client acquisition and adviser recruitment programme.

All of the above translate to a continued and sustained growth in Recurring Net Revenue, which
increased from £53 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £97 million in the year ended
31 December 2020, recording a CAGR of 35% and representing 89% of total Net Revenue.

**_Significant growth opportunity underpinned by structural market tailwinds_**

We operate in the fifth largest wealth management market in the world (Source: Global Wealth
Databook 2021), with £500 billion of assets managed by financial advisers in the UK (Source: The Lang
Cat). We have less than 4% market share of the £500 billion advice market, giving us plenty of
headroom to continue growing our business. In 2020, we were the fastest growing company in the
sector, achieving 34% growth in AUA; the next three fastest growing peers achieved assets under
administration growth rates of 32%, 18% and 17%, respectively (Source: Fundscape).

Within the UK wealth management market, we focus on the fastest growing segment of the UK wealth
market, the mass affluent, which includes investors with investable wealth between £100,000 and
£250,000. Given the tailwinds described below, this segment is expected to continue growing faster


-----

than the market average. Moreover, we are positioned to continue benefiting from these trends, given
our unwrapped products and hybrid advice model.

_Well-Positioned for Structural Market Growth_

We are well-positioned for tailwinds linked to the number of structural shifts that underpin the UK
wealth management market. According to an internal survey that started in 2013, we estimate that
there is a savings gap of £17,000 between the existing level of savings for retirement and the amount
necessary to generate a desirable income during retirement, and the UK government is expected to
continue adding initiatives that encourage consumers to save more, driving approximately 4% growth
in gross inflows each year. Recent initiatives included increasing tax savings and pension
auto-enrolment. Demographic trends are also favourable, with 22% of the population aged 65+ in 2030
(vs 18% in 2018), representing a source of sustained growth for us (Source: Office for National
Statistics).

_Growth from Adviser Recruitment_

The average age of independent financial advisers in the United Kingdom is 58 years, and one in five
advisers plans to retire in the next five years (Source: The Private Office, 2020). The recruitment
programmes we have developed provide us with a unique edge to capture the assets under
administration from advisers retiring in the near term.

_Regulatory Tailwinds_

In terms of regulatory developments, the sector has seen a transition from defined benefit plans to
defined contribution plans, which shift the investment responsibility to individuals, driving demand for
financial advice. With the end of compulsory annuitisation, members of defined pension schemes are
no longer required to purchase an annuity with their retirement fund but instead have a variety of
options as to how they can access their retirement income. The increase in accessibility from pensions
freedom has given savers in defined contribution schemes greater and earlier access to their cash,
thus allowing them to make investment decisions at an earlier age and with more capital available.
These changes in regulation represent enduring growth opportunities for us.

_Changing Consumer Trends and Preferences_

Furthermore, the FinTech adoption rate in the United Kingdom has increased significantly, going from
14% in 2015 to 86% in 2021 (Source: Plaid), which represents a great opportunity for True Potential to
leverage our proprietary technology platform by providing advisers and clients an enhanced user
experience. The higher adoption of financial technology platforms and other products, as well as the
greater awareness of the importance of saving and investing, are trends that were clearly identified by
our directors, leading to the development of unique products like impulseSave, the first-of-its-kind
technology that helps clients add money to their investments in an instant and as little as £1 at a time.

Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has helped to accelerate a pre-existing need for increased on-demand
advice that we successfully identified as a key client need. While some competitors are launching
similar services, we have in place a hybrid advice offering that addresses clients’ demand for more
ad-hoc services.

Finally, the level of engagement between our clients and our products is also observable through
several indicators. For instance, during 2021, there were approximately 5.5 million log-ins, of which
approximately 3.4 million (63%) were via the mobile app, through which clients are able to message
and interact more often. Our directors are confident that we are well-suited to meet shifting customer
preferences for digital and hybrid advice as it enables increased engagement.

**_Proprietary technology platform drives better adviser and customer experience and enhanced_**
**_operating leverage_**

Since 2008, we have patiently invested in our proprietary technology platform with the ambition to
provide advisers with a comprehensive set of tools with bespoke configurations for key areas,


-----

including client access and quote panels, as well as to create an investment platform that was
customised for current and anticipated needs of advisers and clients.

The unique value proposition offered by our technology platform is well-reflected in our high level of
coverage and engagement with our advisers and clients. We hold 1.2 million client records (as at
October 2021) and cover approximately 17% of the UK financial adviser market measured by number
of financial advisers. Also, the 5.5 million client log-ins and 3.4 million mobile app client log-ins through
2021 are a good reflection of the intuitive and functions-rich interface of the platform.

Additionally, the strong infrastructure and fully cloud-based system further improve the scalability of the
platform. This scale is evident by the level of operational leverage embedded in the business. Between
31 December 2018 and 30 September 2021, while AUA increased 144% to £18.8 billion. EBITDA
Margin rose from 51% in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 74% in the twelve-month period ended
30 September 2021. In the future, we expect operational leverage to continue playing a role in
improving our profitability.

The below chart illustrates the year-over-year growth of our AUA and operating expenses from 2018 to
2020.

We also have access to a deep data lake of approximately 40 terabytes developed over 14 years that
can be leveraged to provide hyper-personalisation to better service existing clients and enhance
cross-selling. For instance, towards the end of each tax year, we run ISA allowance campaigns, where
TPWM is able to cross reference client data with the investment platform data to identify clients who
have not used their full tax allowance. This enables us to market to those clients to: (i) increase sales;
(ii) intelligently service clients in bulk, helping ensure they do not miss out on the opportunity of taxfree savings; and (iii) engage with the clients with a personalised objective. At the same time, we have
strengthened our relationship of trust and confidence with our customers by granting secrecy and
protection of their data by ensuring state-of-the-art data security with leading third-party certifications.

Over the years, the True Potential platform has been widely recognised by the market. At the UK
Platform Awards 2021, sponsored by Schroders, we were presented with two awards: Best Platform
Service and Best Platform Provider. In addition, we were named ‘Best for Digital ISAs’ in the ‘Best Buys
2021 Awards’ by Boring Money, as well as the ‘Best Fund Platform’ at the City of London Wealth
Management Awards 2021.

**_Attractive financial profile delivering strong cash flow generation_**

True Potential has demonstrated strong growth in revenue and Net Revenue, with revenue increasing
from £121 million to £185 million and Net Revenue increasing from £58 million to £108 million for the
years ended 31 December 2018 and 2020, respectively, implying a 24% revenue CAGR and a 36% Net
Revenue CAGR over that period. This has been the result of continuously growing our AUA and a
favourable market environment. We were able to grow our AUA from £7.7 billion as at 31 December
2018 to £18.8 billion as at 30 September 2021, implying a 38% CAGR thanks to strong net flows and
adviser recruitment that unlocks client asset acquisitions. Additionally, despite offering lower all-in fees,
our fully integrated model provides a buffer against wider market performance, which is observed by
the 23 percentage points increase in the EBITDA Margin from 51% in the year ended 31 December


-----

2018 to 74% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This trend demonstrates our
operational leverage driven by highly scalable operations and significant investments in the platform.

True Potential’s track record of Cash Flow Conversion has improved over the last few years from 64.7%
in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 93.6% in the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021.
Despite investing in adviser recruitment and technology and infrastructure, we were able to continue
generating strong cash flows. Finally, our low level of maintenance capital expenditures gives us
flexibility on how to use our cash flow and significant interest coverage.

**_Structural and cultural focus on good customer outcomes_**

True Potential has a strong track record of creating products centred around clients’ needs, while
offering the products at competitive prices. Despite our fully integrated and technologically advanced
offering, we charge all-in fees that are lower than our main competitors. We charge all-in fees of
approximately 1.7% of invested assets, compared to the 2.3%, 2.3% and 2.0% all-in fees charged by
integrated solutions providers, wealth managers and independent financial advice firms, respectively.

With respect to our investment solutions, the ten portfolios offered by TPI are aligned with our ambition
to provide clients with products that match their risk profile. Since inception, these portfolios have
closely matched their benchmark, thus fulfilling their objective of offering important diversification to
clients’ portfolios. Since inception the portfolios have delivered higher returns than those from the
wider UK discretionary management market as measured by certain financial services firms.

When it comes to client engagement, we aim to provide a superior, seamless and primarily digital
journey with minimal manual intervention. Superior customer experience is underpinned both by the
consistency of client service offered through the Central Advice Team and a platform technology
designed to address needs of the end client. The Central Advice Team provides several client services
that differ from the platform, utilising integrated technology and a head office team to book
appointments or provide access to the live chat. Clients are given an online annual suitability review as
well as having unlimited access to a financial adviser and to the feature impulseSave, which enables
clients to top up investments via their app. Through the Central Advice Team, clients are not subject to
any initial fees or drawdown costs, but instead are charged a low ongoing fee. Finally, through our
enhanced digital offering, we empower customers to review their savings and communicate with
advisers to support saving for retirement.

**_Highly credible, visionary management team complemented by robust governance framework_**

We benefit from a well-established governance structure comprised of a highly credible and visionary
management team with a strong track record. Furthermore, our robust risk management and resilient
internal systems contribute to our success.

The five co-founders, Daniel Harrison, David Harrison, Neil Johnson, Mark Henderson and Earl
Glasgow, have each been with us since our inception. The five co-founders have 155 years combined
of experience in the industry. David Harrison has extensive experience in the wealth management
industry, having previously co-founded Positive Solutions, an independent financial advisory firm.
Daniel Harrison previously headed the Group’s marketing and technology teams. Neil Johnson also
serves as the Managing Partner of TPA. Mark Henderson was instrumental in enhancing the True
Potential Wealth Platform’s product range. Earl Glasgow is responsible for the sales activity on the True
Potential Wealth Platform. The senior leadership team also includes two non-executive directors,
George Peebles, who provides oversight on our strategic activities and specialises in M&A, and Peter
Coward, who previously worked as a tax partner at PwC for 27 years. The senior leadership is rounded
out by experienced individuals who have an average of 29 years in the industry and 12 years with us.

Our risk management strategy can be broken down to the individual entities: TPI and TPWM.

_TPI_

TPI seeks to reduce and mitigate operational risk where possible. This is achieved by identifying and
then implementing necessary actions to prevent such risks from occurring. We seek to achieve this


-----

through managing risk with two internal operational risk teams who are split between incident
management and Risk and Control Self Assessment (“RCSA”) implementation. In order to mitigate
incidents in the future, we use an in-house system for recording and tracking incidents then utilise a
management information suite for the purpose of trend analysis. The RCSAs plot every process and
detail the operational risk faced by the business if an aspect of that process fails.

These systems are combined, as the RCSA identifies the risk and we can set action plans to resolve
the incident. The process directly links in to show where controls are starting to fail, risks are
materialising and the financial and potential reputational impact of incidents. As a result, we can
quickly identify any emerging trends and look to resolve them in a much more efficient and effective
way before issues becoming more widespread or having much further-reaching consequences.

In addition to our personnel, our technology is pivotal in providing an instant and direct approach to
inform clients of transfers, updated policies, and movements of money, among other things.

_TPWM_

TPWM seeks to reduce and/or mitigate operational risk where possible, which is achieved through a
compliance monitoring plan that requires regular review and analysis of all risks and controls present
within the firm. Compliance staff are split between monitoring and control, which oversees day-to-day
compliance activities, and training and competence, which undertakes longer-term monitoring and
training of adviser activities.

Technology is integrated into all processes, ensuring risks are quickly and easily identified as they
materialise and can be dealt with effectively. Advice is provided through a technology-based solution
ensuring that consistent and compliant advice is provided by all advisers within the firm and enabling
automated monitoring of specific business types.

In addition, management expects to benefit from the business relationships, market knowledge,
leadership and experience of Cinven.

Cinven has invested in more than 130 companies, having raised €37 billion total funds since its
inception in 1977. Examples of Cinven’s prior investments in the financial services sector, and
particularly in highly regulated assets, include the acquisitions of Compre, Guardian Financial
Services, Miller, NewDay, Partnership Assurance and Premium Credit Limited, in the United Kingdom,
Ark Life and Avolon in Ireland, Heidelberger Leben (now renamed Viridium Group) in Germany,
Skandia in Germany and Austria and Ergo Italia and Old Mutual Wealth in Italy. In addition, Cinven
maintains transparent and constructive relationships with regulators, having achieved regulatory
approvals over 40 times in different European jurisdictions as well as in Bermuda and Singapore.

**Our Strategies**

We have developed the following strategies to maintain and expand our market-leading positions,
make our businesses more profitable and exploit market opportunities.

**_Continue to focus on adviser recruitment and client asset acquisition_**

We have a strong record in growing our adviser network with the TPWM partner firm having increased
from 456 Wealth Management Partners as at 31 December 2018 to 844 as at 30 September 2021. Our
network of Wealth Management Partners is further complemented by our Central Advice Team of
40 advisers and staff as at 30 September 2021. We have developed a proposition for advisers looking
to monetise their client books and/or raising capital to further grow their client networks. This
proposition is extremely compelling, especially as the transfer of client assets is entirely digitised which
leads to a high conversion rate.

Given our superior technology stack and its consequential impacts on customer experience, we
remain a partner of choice for advisers and clients. There remains a sizable opportunity to target
advisers with our recruitment proposition. We estimate that approximately 24,000, or 87%, of the
approximately 27,500 financial advisers in the United Kingdom are addressable to our recruitment


-----

proposition, with the small firms deemed the easiest to target. As reported by the FCA in July 2021, the
total number of financial advisers in the United Kingdom as at 31 December 2020 was 27,501.
Platforum has reported that 53% of UK financial advisers are in firms with fewer than 50 advisers
(Source: Platforum UK Financial Advisers, November 2020). The smaller firms in the market have seen
increasing regulatory costs and burdens over recent years, via increasing FSCS levy and additional
requirements relating to processing personally identifiable data; therefore, to run a small advice firm is
now particularly challenging. We are better equipped to target advisers from these smaller firms given
that we recruit adviser-by-adviser, rather than at firm level.

True Potential is targeting further productivity gains through specific initiatives, including:

- _Additional sales initiatives. We use Business Development Managers to target additional sales_
opportunities. By making our digital products – Digital Direct Offer, impulseSave, Client Site
Transfer – available to our advisers, we stand to benefit from additional new money inflows onto
our platform and fund products.

- _Advisers focused on OPT market. It is estimated that the current addressable market for defined_
benefit to defined contribution transfers is £782 billion (Source: True Potential Due Diligence
Report). The OPT process is centrally controlled with the entire transfer process digitised end-toend. Given the direct oversight from our head office, the OPT process allows advisers to focus on
the sales process while benefiting from the consistency of a seamless customer journey and
auditable transfer process. True Potential remains differentiated in its approach with limited
competitive threats given its technology advantage.

- _Client Service Transfer (CST) initiative. Advisers have the option to transfer their client business to_
our Central Advice Team. This allows the adviser to use the proceeds from the transfer to focus
on building new client relationships and to pay for client leads to accelerate rebuilding their client
books.

We have an innovative platform that underpins our advice offering. The benefit of having started with
an in-house, purpose-built technology platform from the outset is that we have captured material data
on how our users – both advisers and clients – interact with the technology and the functions they
value. This allows us to make targeted offers on the channel with the highest client engagement
translating to a higher success conversion rate.

**_Further improve operational efficiency_**

True Potential has consistently recorded yearly increases in EBITDA Margin. This metric increased from
51% for the year ended 31 December 2018 to 74% for the twelve-month period ended 30 September
2021. The primary driver of our EBITDA Margin is our fully invested, scalable and proprietary
technology platform.

The core architecture of the platform has been provisioned with significant growth potential. For
example, just in terms of storage we have has contracted for 70 terabytes of private cloud capacity and
are currently at 40 terabytes usage. To complement this, we have contracted for 2,800 gigabyte
storage on the public cloud with only approximately 900 gigabytes currently being used. In the future,
our strategy is to continue migrating from the private cloud to a public cloud, which is offered by
Microsoft Azure – a platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) approach whereby Microsoft manages the ongoing
patching of components. This change will bring us several advantages:

- the ability to focus on developing the components to meet the business needs, instead of
spending too much time on the underlying requirements of infrastructure installations and
maintenance;

- a more flexible cost structure, as we will only pay for what we use, when we use it, and with the
option to turn it off when it is no longer needed; and


-----

- infinite scalability across the globe, as we will not need to project for and purchase expected
infrastructure upfront; we can initiate new projects instantly with the minimum required
infrastructure and scale up as we go.

We expect that the benefits of increasing scale through the business plan are also going to be evident
in the cost of the TPI Funds. The sub-fund managers are on tiered charging structures; as AUM
increases the effective pay away reduces as a result of the tiering. Enhanced scale will also allow us
to negotiate better terms with new sub-advisers we attract to the business.

Management actively reviews the operational set-up of True Potential to unlock cost savings. Two
recent examples include the insourcing of SEI activities and the recent ACD authorisation. SEI
provided the back-office technology and custodianship of the assets on the platform prior to 2018
when TPI built the platform in house. The re-platforming of the assets from the SEI system to the TPI
build system was seamless, which we believe is unprecedented in the platform industry. On the other
hand, Smith and Williamson provided the outsourced ACD function for the TPI fund range prior to the
launch of TPA in 2021.

**_Continue to develop True Potential’s investment solutions_**

Our objective is to deliver investment solutions that offer multi-layered diversification with attractive
risk/reward trade-off at a low cost. There is currently £16.5 billion of AUM in TPI Funds and 93% of total
inflows during the nine-months to 30 September 2021 have been invested in these funds. Since
inception, TPI Funds have delivered strong performance across its range of funds. Delivering the right
outcomes from the range of investment solutions is particularly important and TPI will continue to focus
on sustaining its record of investment outperformance for its customers.

We recently received FCA approval to launch seven new funds, two income funds and five funds
across our current risk categories, adding two new fund managers to our proposition. For the income
portfolios, these managers will provide further diversification to income sources and reduce the current
UK bias. Adding a new manager across our current risk profiles will bring a growth-orientated style
based on their thematic approach to equity selection in our strategies.

TPI, being an integral part of True Potential, provides distinct advantages and allows for close
integration and collaboration across the group. In the future, we expect to develop additional products
to directly meet the needs of customers, including those focused on sustainability.

**_Continue to invest in data and analytics_**

We use technology to ensure end clients have the best possible experience whilst also allowing us to
bulk service clients without significantly growing our teams. Our ability to enable and transition clients
to a state of comfort in managing their own financial affairs online or within the app is key to achieving
this objective. A clear example of our success in this initiative comes from the Central Advice Team,
where we have approximately 30,400 clients serviced by 40 people. Furthermore, we can see a
growing trend in the numbers of client log-ins and returning client log-ins from Central Advice Team
clients and, specifically, clients tend to log-in ten times per month on the app and four times per month
on the web.

Client engagement has always been a key aspect in our business model because the most engaged
clients generally have more assets on our platform. For instance, the Central Advice Team clients
categorised as “Super Engaged” have, on average, assets with £328,000 invested with us, compared
to “Not Engaged” clients worth £93,000 and “Not Activated” clients with £48,000.

As a higher level of client engagement is associated with larger average portfolios, we have been
developing several initiatives with the ultimate goal of improving the engagement level with our clients.
True Potential introduced the next instance of the client facing suite, cNext, in January 2022. This
upgrade is the next level of evolution for True Potential’s client portal which will embed enhanced
analytics and machine learning to identify and customise client-relevant information and product
marketing.


-----

As part of cNext, we have also laid the foundational client-visible features to enable improved
personalisation and hyper-personalisation going forward. The prior current client site had standardised
videos, blogs and articles for clients. In the new instance, these feeds are tailored to respective client
profiles and individual client circumstances and events building on insights gathered from the wealth
of personal information gathered within a standard factfind along with portfolio events, behaviour and
browsing history on the website and app. We also improved our capabilities to send tailored content
and push notifications on the web and our mobile app and enhanced our already available (via the
web) video chat to also be directly available within our mobile apps with no requirement for additional
third-party component installations (such as Zoom). Additionally, we are increasingly integrating open
banking features within our client site. This allows clients to aggregate their bank accounts and offplatform investments on a single view alongside their True Potential investments, in addition to allowing
the clients the ability to visualise their current spending habits and set budgeting targets for the future.
We are also offering rewards to clients as an additional pull feature. Engagement behaviour is useful
for us to improve targeted marketing by allowing relevant product information to be made available in
real time, which translates to a higher success rate. The key objective of these features is to encourage
the end client to self-service, but in doing so data is generated, tracked and analysed by us. We have
a deep data lake of approximately 40 terabytes developed over a span of 14 years that can be
leveraged to hyper-personalise and better service existing clients and enhance cross-selling.

In order to further leverage our well-established back-end system, we continue enhancing our
back-end data architecture and infrastructure with the development of our client analytics infrastructure
and cube. Client analytics is key to enabling the ease at which data are ingested from the various
facets of the True Potential system and denormalised from data into information that can be easily
interrogated by data analysts with a view to further understand clients, personalise our engagement
with each individual on a bulk scale and predict and influence their behaviour in future. Some
advantages coming from our improvements are easily and automatically identifying and acting upon
opportunities within the client bank, better predicting client behaviour based on categorisation and
clustering and hyper-personalising the engagement with and experience of the end client. A final key
component of our strategy is bringing this engagement information back into the vNext system, so that
if a client does need to speak to us, we have an unrivalled visual of the client history and behaviour
immediately visible, thereby ensuring that the end client gets the best possible support.

_management accounts and have not been prepared on the same basis as our Financial Statements. For_
_a description of AUA, AUM and EBITDA, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—_
_Non-GAAP Measures”. This information has not been audited, reviewed or compiled, nor have any_

_comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results as at and for the nine months ended_
_30 September 2021 or any other period. See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”._

As at 31 October and 30 November 2021, AUA on the True Potential platform totalled £19.4 billion and
£19.9 billion, respectively, and AUM invested in TPI Funds totalled £17.1 billion and £17.6 billion,
respectively. Our EBITDA for the months of October and November 2021 was £12.0 million and
£12.9 million, respectively (September 2021: £11.7 million).

**Our History**

True Potential was founded in 2007 by our chairman, David Harrison, and senior partners, Daniel
Harrison, Neil Johnson, Mark Henderson and Earl Glasgow, with the establishment of TPAS. TPAS was
enhanced in 2008 with compliance consultancy services. The distribution expansion phase of our
development continued in 2010 with the receipt of FCA authorisation for TPWM.


-----

The next phase of our growth was focused on the development of our technology platform. We
launched our internally developed wealth management platform, the True Potential Wealth Platform, in
2011 and over time brought together the core elements of True Potential, including the back-office
system, the wealth management platform and client servicing tools, such as unique client websites.

From 2015, when we launched our own fund range and our discretionary service, our growth has
accelerated through the introduction of our own products. In 2016, we reached the milestone of
£1 billion invested in True Potential Portfolios eleven months after launch and achieved £2 billion only
five months later.

In 2018, we launched our in-house built, enhanced True Potential Wealth Platform, and in 2019 we
completed the migration of assets from the platform of our technology partner. In that year our total
assets under management reached £10 billion, and we launched our adviser recruiting and client
acquisition programme. In 2021, TPA became an internal ACD. Our recent development has been
further accelerated by the launch and rapid growth of our in-house team of financial advisers and
support staff (the “Central Advice Team”), which assists and advises clients directly. As at 30
September 2021, the Central Advice Team managed £4.5 billion of assets from approximately 30,600
clients.

On 8 September 2021 we announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in the business to Cinven,
which we expect to enable us to continue our growth and further develop our industry-leading
investment technology platform.

_True Potential Wealth Platform_

TPI provides access to the True Potential Wealth Platform, which offers a range of investment solutions,
including diversified True Potential Portfolios managed on a nil cost discretionary basis. The in-house,
purpose-built proprietary platform underpins the client and adviser proposition, and serves
approximately 360,000 customers. Products offered include personal pensions, ISAs and general
investment accounts.

The True Potential Wealth Platform is engineered with the future in mind, delivering innovation, choice,
control and value. The platform is structured for growth and was built from the ground up for UK
financial advisers looking to maximise investment opportunities for clients. The platform uses True


-----

Potential’s award-winning in-house technology and integrates innovative features such as
impulseSave, which enables investors to “top-up” investments that have been previously advised upon
at the touch of a button by adding micro-payments to their investments at account level or at fund level,
and True Potential One, our financial planning system that consolidates all of a client’s savings and
investments in one convenient location.

The True Potential Wealth Platform offers a wide range of investments that allow investors to invest their
capital within innovative risk-rated investment options and gives them exposure to world-class
investment managers. Among the investment options are True Potential Portfolios, a range of ten
discretionary managed portfolios that blend together funds from a range of asset managers in our
wealth strategy fund range using advanced diversification. Advisers and investors can also choose to
construct a bespoke plan from the thousands of mutual funds, bonds (onshore and offshore),
exchange traded funds and equities that we have available. Investors also have access to a range of
exclusive tax wrappers, including our stocks and shares ISA and personal pension, to ensure
investments are as tax efficient as possible.

As at 30 September 2021, the True Potential platform had AUA of £18.8 billion, £16.5 billion of which
were AUM invested in exclusive TPI Funds, with the remainder being AUA invested in third-party funds.
AUA growth from £7.7 billion as at 31 December 2018 through 30 September 2021 represents a CAGR
of 26.8%. In addition, True Potential was the fastest growing company in terms of AUA growth in 2020,
where it recorded an AUA growth of 20%. TPI AUM growth at a CAGR of 31.3% from £6.0 billion as at
31 December 2018 to £16.5 billion as at 30 September 2021 has delivered better economics for True
Potential while also delivering savings to clients as client charges for the most invested portfolio, the
True Potential Balanced Portfolio, have decreased from 82 basis points in 2018 to 80 basis points in
2021 while the net fund margin for TPI Funds has increased from 80 basis points in 2018 to 100 basis
points in 2021.

_True Potential Portfolios_

Through the TPI platform, True Potential clients have access to ten exclusive True Potential Portfolios
made up of 34 underlying funds (the “TPI Funds”), 28 of which are sub-advised by a leading panel of
global investment firms and six of which are managed directly by True Potential’s in-house investment
team. The True Potential Portfolios are managed by our in-house team on a discretionary basis at no
additional cost to the end client. We use eight sub-advisers comprising a number of the world’s leading
investment management groups, delivering their expertise to True Potential’s clients at low cost. Our
eight sub-advisers are based in 174 global locations and include approximately 9,800 experts,
providing end clients access to investment solutions. We work with the following investment fund
managers that sub-manage the TPI Funds, blending their management styles for an extra layer of
diversification in our True Potential Portfolios: UBS, Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Schroders, SEI, Close Brothers Asset
Management and Seven Investment Management. The 34 underlying funds can also be separately
accessed by our clients.

True Potential Portfolios are a suite of fully diversified, discretionary-managed investment solutions.
With wide exposure to world-class investment managers, as well as diversifying investments by asset
class and geographic region, investors benefit from having more potential to grow their money and
manage volatility, all in one portfolio.

We continually monitor our portfolios to make sure they perform as expected and remain within an
investor’s chosen risk profile. We also rebalance for the future, rather than the past, taking an active
approach to allocating investors’ money where we see the greatest potential for growth.


-----

Our ten portfolios are mapped to five Morningstar risk profiles. We offer one defensive portfolio, three
cautious portfolios, three balanced portfolios, two growth portfolios and one aggressive portfolio, as
illustrated below.

Aggressive

The Defensive, Cautious, Balanced, Growth and Aggressive portfolios contain all of the funds within
their risk category, meaning they are most diversified by fund manager in the applicable range. The
Cautious+, Balanced+ and Growth+ portfolios are carefully allocated to provide exposure to funds
outside their risk category, while still remaining within the risk profile to ensure maximum growth. The
Cautious Income and Balanced Income portfolios are risk-mapped income portfolios that provide a
monthly income.

The performance of each of the unique portfolios since inception and for the twelve-month period
ended 30 September 2021, is set out below.

True Potential Portfolios are actively managed and controlled by True Potential’s investment team. As
at 30 September 2021, eight True Potential staff members were focused on data gathering and risk
analysis, including having full access to underlying portfolio data daily, having regular manager
discussion with the analyst team, aggregating data and risk modelling with capital market
assumptions, expected returns and volatility. A further ten staff members were engaged in fund
manager interview and analysis (e.g. analysing the portfolio position, analysing transactions and
development questions for managers), identifying key themes (e.g. analysing asset allocation and
asset class changes), portfolio decision-making (e.g. asset allocation, manager changes, portfolio
changes and optimisation for risk, cost, risk-adjusted return and long-term expected return) and
adviser and client communications (e.g. daily market updates, weekly webinars, podcasts and roundups, monthly updates and fact sheets and quarterly publications, seminars and workshops).

**_True Potential Wealth Management_**

TPWM provides financial advice on a restricted basis for clients investing into funds and portfolios
offered by True Potential. It comprises more than 850 financial advisers, including 844 Wealth
Management Partners as well as the True Potential in-house Central Advice Team. True Potential offers
a highly competitive, lower annual all-in fee of approximately 1.7% of assets invested for clients for the
full wealth management range of services (advice, platform services and investment solutions) as
compared to the broader market, where charges are typically 2.0-2.3%.

TPWM benefits from three distribution channels: (i) Wealth Management Partners; (ii) occupational
pension transfer; and (iii) client acquisition through our recruitment programme. These distribution
channels generated revenue of £1.1 billion, £0.9 billion and £3.2 billion, respectively, for the
twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021.

Investors from each of these channels receive financial advice from either our Wealth Management
Partners, who are self-employed restricted advisers, or the True Potential Central Advice Team.

As at 30 September 2021, we had approximately 1.2 million total end clients using our services,
including approximately 30,600 clients receiving financial advice from our Central Advice Team. As at
that date, 844 Wealth Management Partners managed £8.4 billion of assets, receiving 90% of the
applicable advice fees while approximately 10% of the advice fee was retained by True Potential, while
40 Central Advice Team members provided financial advice covering £4.5 billion of AUM, with 100% of
advice fees retained by TPWM.

TPWM clients receive restricted wealth advice from advisers having access to TPI Funds and benefiting
from an integrated technology-enabled platform. We expect TPWM clients to be on the True Potential
platform for more than 25 years based on their ages, with a majority being 60 years old or younger.
TPWM clients are based all over the United Kingdom and come from varying wealth bands. The
highest proportion of clients are from the <25,000 wealth band, driven by our auto-enrolment pension
channel, where clients do not receive financial advice.

TPWM-advised AUM has experienced significant growth supported by a multi-pronged sales strategy.
AUM for TPWM Wealth Management Partners was £4.1 billion at the end of 2018. In 2019, we launched
our adviser and client recruiting programme and our Central Advice Team began advising clients,
adding to total AUM. Total AUM for TPWM grew to £6.1 billion at the end of 2019, made up of
£1.3 billion from the Central Advice Team and £4.8 billion from Wealth Management Partners. At the
end of 2020, total AUM for TPWM grew to £9.0 billion, including £2.8 billion from the Central Advice
Team and £6.2 billion from Wealth Management Partners. As at 30 September 2021, total AUM for
TPWM was £13.0 billion, with £4.5 billion from the Central Advice Team and £8.5 billion from Wealth
Management Partners. The gross profit margin for TPWM was 11%, 14% and 23% in 2018, 2019 and
2020, respectively. TPWM gross profit margin for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021
was 28.0%.

_Wealth Management Partners_

As at 30 September 2021, £8.4 billion of the AUA on the True Potential platform were assets of clients
of 844 self-employed restricted advisers who are focused on the investment opportunities on True
Potential’s platform and in its portfolios. We refer to these advisers as our “Wealth Management
**Partners”.**

Fees earned from Wealth Management Partner-managed assets contributed £70.9 million, or 42.9%, of
the Group’s Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This contribution
was made up of advice fees, platform fees, fund fees and performance fees paid by clients. Clients pay
advice fees to their advisers of around 75 basis points (blended basis of ongoing fees and one-off fees)
of the amount invested, 90% of which is retained by the Wealth Management Partner and 10% of which
is recorded as revenue for True Potential. For the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021,
advice fees for Wealth Management Partners contributed £7.4 million of Net Revenue.


-----

_Central Advice Team_

As at 30 September 2021, £4.5 billion of the AUA on the True Potential platform were assets of clients
managed by our 40-member in-house Central Advice Team. Many of these clients have been
introduced to the True Potential platform through our recruiting programme, where advisers wishing to
transfer their clients introduce the investors to the True Potential service proposition, and the client can
then elect to obtain advice from our Central Advice Team. For additional information, see “—Client
_Acquisition and Adviser Recruiting Programme” below._

Fees earned from Central Advice Team managed assets contributed £52.6 million, or 31.8%, of the
Group’s Net Revenue for the twelve-month period ended 30 September 2021. This contribution was
made up of advice fees, platform fees, fund fees and performance fees paid by clients. The Central
Advice Team charges an initial fee of 50 basis points. For the twelve-month period ended
30 September 2021, advice fees for the Central Advice Team contributed £18.3 million of Net Revenue.

launched. As at 30 September 2021, a total of £4.9 billion from TPAS firms was on the True Potential
platform, of which £3.1 billion was invested in TPI Funds.

TPAS provides back-office software to independent financial advisers who are then able to choose to

**Adviser Recruitment and Retirement Programme**

We offer financial advisers a simple portfolio transfer proposition, with different offers targeted at
advisers either looking for capital to grow or, alternatively, to retire and manage client succession. We
have a strong track record of client acquisition and adviser recruitment, with a competitive advantage
driven by our ability to offer a better proposition to advisers and clients. An overview of the True
Potential recruiting programme is illustrated below.

The opportunities provide certain benefits to the adviser, including the ability to maximise capital now
and/or in the future. Advisers receive their agreed-upon share of advice fees daily. �

For independent financial advisers who are looking for capital to grow their client assets, we offer an
upfront payment of 2% of their assets under management when they transition their clients to True
Potential. When joining True Potential under this option the independent financial adviser becomes one
of our Wealth Management Partners. The Wealth Management Partners continue to advise and provide
services to their clients while retaining 90% or more of the total advice fees earned. If the adviser wishes
to fully transition their clients to the True Potential Central Advice team at a later date, they can sell their
portfolio for 2.75% of the value of the assets. We refer to this path as the “2% proposition” in our client
acquisition and adviser recruiting programme.

For independent financial advisers who are seeking to retire or otherwise exit the market, we offer a
loan of 8% of their assets under management to be paid in the first six months when they transfer
clients to the True Potential Central Advice Team. Payment is made on completion of the arrangement


-----

after 12-24 months. We refer to this path as the “8% proposition” in our client acquisition and adviser
recruiting programme.

Advisers onboarded as Wealth Management Partners through the recruitment programme go through
a rigorous rules-based process. As a first step, information is requested on the adviser and the
adviser’s end clients to ensure thorough due diligence by True Potential on the adviser and the client
portfolios. The adviser then completes a three-day modular online training course and provides
confirmation that references can be requested covering the last six years of authorisation from the
adviser’s previous firm or firms. Annual compliance reviews are then conducted on advisers.

As at 30 September 2021, £11.1 billion of AUA from approximately 24,000 clients had been added to
the True Potential platform since the start of the recruitment programme in July 2018. In addition,
clients from 244 advisers have been onboarded through the 8% proposition, and 204 of our 8%
advisers remain as Wealth Management Partners as at 30 September 2021.

The programme also provides a transparent and seamless transfer of assets onto the True Potential
platform for the end client where they are being transferred from independent financial advisers to the
Central Advice Team. Clients are requested to complete a detailed questionnaire providing information
on their assets, life goals and expectations. The data is then anonymised and the transferable assets
are confirmed, ensuring that they can be transferred without detriment to the client. An implementation
plan is then put in place where TPWM provides a welcome pack with information on the resources
available and relevant contact information. The focus is on understanding the client’s situation and her
or his expectations. The client is then onboarded as a True Potential client and serviced by our fully
dedicated, experienced and scalable in-house Central Advice Team.

The Central Advice Team’s onboarding process includes telephone, email and text engagement with
the client, an online demonstration of True Potential’s services, and engagement with the client on the
app and website through our daily, weekly and quarterly videos, podcasts and publications. The
Central Advice Team provides all client advice needs online and is available twelve hours per day on
weekdays.

The recruitment programme has resulted in strong client asset conversion rates, with 75% and 83% of
transferable client assets under the 2% proposition and the 8% proposition, respectively, being
transferred to True Potential.

Between 1 January and 30 September 2021, the Central Advice Team answered approximately 37,000
calls, 15,000 live chats and 23,000 secure client messages. Nearly 4,000 online demonstrations were
completed and clients had logged in over 1.1 million times. £35.0 million of additional assets had also
been added using impulseSave. Clients have saved approximately 20 basis points on financial advice
fees and approximately 80 basis points on platform and fund fees by virtue of being clients of the
Central Advice Team.

**Our Technology**

From the outset, our founding partners believed that technology would play a pivotal role in the wealth
management industry, and our vision 14 years ago was to be an agile, innovative, end-to-end,
multi-channel “wealthtech” via an integrated technology platform. Our technology platform is the core
of the firm. It is a fully integrated tech stack for advisers and clients that enables better user experience
and enhanced cross selling, and it was built and developed in-house by a focused multi-disciplinary
team led by our founding partners and shareholders.

**_Our Technology Platform_**

First launched as an adviser system in 2008, our award-winning technology platform is a single
end-to-end fully integrated multi-channel technology platform catering to all ecosystem needs, with the
purpose of enabling our vertically integrated model and delivering operational gearing and tangible
results, such as growth in AUA, efficiency savings and greater profit margins. With the help of our
technology platform, from 31 December 2018 to 30 September 2021, our EBITDA Margin increased by


-----

25.1 percentage points and AUA grew at a CAGR of 38.2%, while during the same time period, IT costs
decreased at a CAGR of -9%.

The architecture of our technology platform is illustrated below.

Our technology platform is also supported by our deep data lake, which is enhanced by multiple
touchpoints across the user base and provides distinctive insights to better service existing clients and
enhance cross-selling. Over the past 14 years, through our technology platform, we have processed
millions of documents, commission statements, secure messages and recommendations. The
in-depth client data allows for hyper-personalisation based on client behaviour, through providing
actionable insights to our advisers and enabling our service team to form a real-time view on changes
in client circumstances. For example, through open banking, traditional bank account transactions are
imported into the True Potential database through a third-party provider, with the data analysed to
provide budgeting and opportunity suggestions. In addition, the deep data lake also enables and
enhances up-selling and cross-selling of products and services through targeted marketing.

###### REGULATION

There are currently three FCA regulated entities within the True Potential group:

- TPI is an investment firm with FCA regulatory permissions which include: (i) advising on
investments, P2P agreements, pension transfers and pension opt outs; (ii) arranging deals in
investments, regulated mortgage contracts and safeguarding and administration of assets;
(iii) dealing in investment as agent and dealing investments as principal; (iv) establishing,
operating or winding up a stakeholder pension scheme/personal pension scheme; (v) making
arrangements with a view to regulated mortgage contracts/transactions in investments;
(vi) managing investments; (vii) safeguarding and administration of assets (without arranging);
(viii) client money; and (ix) payment services (account information services).

- TPWM is authorised to provide advice on investments, pensions (including occupational),
mortgages and home finance and credit broking to retail and commercial clients. As at
30 September 2021, TPWM had more than 900 financial advisers who were authorised as
registered individuals under TPWM, all of whom other than Earl Glasgow (SMF27) are restricted
advisers, primarily advising on the products and funds offered by TPI.

- TPA is the management company within True Potential’s asset management business. The
authorised funds are all UK UCITS schemes. TPA is an authorised fund manager (ACD to the
OEICS and Manager to the authorised unit trust). TPA has permission for managing a UK UCITS
and may only carry on the activities specified in COLL 6.9.9R(1) to (3) which include: (i) managing
a UK UCITS; (ii) activities in respect of (i); and (iii) collective portfolio management. Investment
management is delegated to TPI, which may sub-delegate to agreed delegates. TPA does not
hold client money.

TPI, TPWM and TPA operate in a highly regulated environment which is subject to a very high degree
of focus by the FCA. A significant amount of resources is typically required by firms who operate within
the private wealth management space to ensure that adequate processes are in place to monitor,
manage and mitigate relevant risk exposure.

**Regulation in the United Kingdom**

**_Financial Services Act 2012_**

Prior to 31 March 2013, UK regulated firms in the True Potential group were required to be authorised
by the Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”). Accordingly, those firms were required to comply with
the rules and guidance made by the FSA pursuant to the FSMA and set out in the FSA Handbook of
rules and guidance.

The Financial Services Act 2012 (“FS Act”) (and the secondary legislation made under it) reformed the
framework for financial regulation in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the FSA was replaced by the FCA,
the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Policy Committee (the “FPC”). With
effect from 1 April 2013, the UK regulated firms in the Group became authorised and regulated by the
FCA. UK regulated entities in the Group must comply with the rules and guidance of the FCA (as
applicable) made under the FSMA.

The FPC is a subcommittee of the court of directors at the Bank of England and has powers and
responsibilities in relation to systemic risk within the financial services sector, responding to sectoral
issues that could threaten UK economic and financial stability. The FPC has powers to give directions
to the PRA and the FCA.

**_Financial Conduct Authority_**

The FCA regulates the conduct of every authorised firm. Its “operational objectives” are to secure an
appropriate degree of protection for consumers, protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial
system and promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA also has a “strategic
objective” of ensuring that relevant markets function well.


-----

**_Financial Services and Markets Act 2000_**

_FCA Rule Making Powers_

The FCA has powers under the FSMA and the FS Act to make rules, which are set out in the FCA
Handbook. These rules are legally binding. The FSMA contains checks and balances in relation to the
exercise of these powers, including the procedures that the regulators must follow in the exercise of
their rule-making powers. The FCA has the statutory power to make general rules applying to firms for
which it is the sole regulator.

_Permission to Carry out Regulated Activities in the United Kingdom_

In order to authorise a person to carry on regulated activities in the United Kingdom, the FCA must
determine that the applicant meets regulatory requirements, including certain “threshold conditions”.
The threshold conditions are the minimum conditions which must be satisfied (both at the time of
authorisation, and on an ongoing basis) in order for a firm to gain and continue to have permission to
carry on the relevant regulated activities under the FSMA. These relate to matters including the
applicant’s legal form, whether the applicant has adequate resources (both financial and non-financial)
to carry on its business and whether, having regard to all the circumstances (including whether the
applicant’s affairs are conducted soundly and prudently), and the applicant is a fit and proper person
to conduct the relevant regulated activities.

Firms are authorised to carry on only those regulated activities for which they been granted permission
under the FSMA and are not permitted to carry on any other regulated activities. Once authorised, in
addition to continuing to meet the threshold conditions, firms must comply with the provisions of the
FSMA, related secondary legislation and the rules made by the FCA under the FSMA. Failure to
continue to meet the threshold conditions may lead to revocation of a firm’s authorisation.

_Supervision and Enforcement_

The nature and extent of the FCA’s supervisory relationship with a firm depends on, among other
considerations, how much of a risk the FCA consider that firm could pose to the achievement of its
statutory objectives.

The FCA has powers to take a range of enforcement actions, including the ability to sanction
UK-authorised firms. In particular, enforcement action may include restrictions on undertaking new
business, public censure, restitution, fines and, ultimately, revocation of permission to carry on
regulated activities. The FCA may also take enforcement action against individuals performing certain
controlled functions in relation to authorised persons.

The FCA has further powers to obtain injunctions against UK-authorised firms where a UK-authorised
firm has breached relevant requirements, including requirements imposed by or under the FSMA or
under certain EU legislation, and to impose or seek restitution orders where clients or other affected
parties have suffered loss, or the firm has obtained a profit as a result of a breach of a relevant
requirement. In certain circumstances, the FCA also has the power to take action against unauthorised
parent undertakings of UK-authorised persons, including by issuing directions to do or refrain from
doing a particular activity.

_Principles for Businesses and Fundamental Rules_

The FCA’s Principles for Businesses (the “Principles”) set out high-level principles that apply to all
authorised persons in the United Kingdom. Amongst other things, the Principles require firms to treat
customers fairly, maintain adequate financial resources and communicate with customers in a way that
is clear, fair and not misleading.

The FCA has also established six key outcomes it expects firms to focus on in order to ensure that they
are treating customers fairly in accordance with the Principles. These include ensuring that consumers
can be confident they are dealing with firms where the fair treatment of customers is central to the


-----

firm’s corporate culture, and that products and services marketed and sold in the retail market are
designed to meet the needs of identified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly.

The emphasis and reliance on these overarching rules and principles by the FCA has marked a move
to more judgment-based regulation in recent years, focusing on the achievement of positive outcomes.

**_Senior Management, Systems and Controls_**

Within the FCA Handbook, the Senior Management, Systems and Controls (“SYSC”) Sourcebook
contains general organisational requirements that apply to a number of different types of
UK-authorised firms, including UK-authorised asset management and investment firms. These
requirements elaborate on Principle 3 of the FCA Principles for Businesses, which requires firms to
take reasonable care to organise and control their affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk
management systems.

Among other things, in broad terms, the SYSC Sourcebook contains rules relating to the persons who
effectively direct the business of a MiFID investment firm, UCITS management company or AIFM. It
requires firms to employ personnel with the skills, knowledge and expertise necessary for the
discharge of the responsibilities allocated to them, requires firms to implement systems and controls
relating to compliance and risk controls and contains requirements relating to outsourcing and
conflicts of interest, amongst other things.

**_Senior Managers and Certification Regime_**

The SMCR came into force in the United Kingdom for nearly all solo-regulated firms in December 2019.
The SMCR, as it applies to such firms, requires firms to allocate responsibility for certain senior
management functions to individuals pre-approved by the FCA (“Senior Managers”). The SMCR also
introduced a certification regime for staff employed in positions where they could pose a significant
risk of harm to their firm or its customers. A new set of conduct rules were also introduced that apply
to Senior Managers, certified employees and almost all other individuals working for firms that are
subject to the SMCR. Additional conduct rules apply to Senior Managers. SMCR requires firms to
assess the fitness and propriety of certified persons on an ongoing basis, and at least once a year.

Solo-regulated firms were required to submit data for a publicly available directory of SMCR individuals
and to carry out their first assessment of the fitness and propriety of certified employees by 31 March
2021. The conduct rules began to apply to staff who are not Senior Managers or certified employees
as at the same date.

**_Conduct of Business Requirements_**

The FCA regulates, through the COBS, the Mortgage and Home Finance: Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“MCOB”) and the Insurance Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“ICOBS”), the
distribution and sale of certain investment products. COBS applies to various firms in the True Potential
group.

The scope and range of the obligations imposed on an authorised firm under COBS, MCOB and
ICOBS vary according to the scope of the firm’s business and the nature of its clients. By way of
example, the rules in COBS, MCOB and ICOBS require firms to provide clients with information about
the firm, meet certain standards of product disclosure, assess suitability when advising on certain
products, report appropriately to clients and provide certain disclosures, including in relation to client
assets held in custody.

**_Rules Applicable to Distribution_**

Authorised firms that are involved in the manufacture or distribution of retail investment products are
subject to a number of rules and regulations that aim to ensure that firms act in the best interests of
customers and treat customers fairly. For example:


-----

- MiFID II, the UK implementation of which remains part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 contains a range of investor protection
measures applicable to firms subject to MiFID II, including a prohibition on independent advisers
retaining commission from third parties, product oversight and governance rules and rules on
inducements. See “—Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II” below.

- COBS 6.1A contains rules on adviser charging and remuneration that apply to firms making
personal recommendations to retail clients in relation to retail investment products and certain
other products in the United Kingdom. In particular, a firm must only be remunerated for a
personal recommendation and any other related services by adviser charges, and must not solicit
or accept any other commissions, remuneration or benefit of any kind in connection with the
firm’s business of advising, regardless of whether it intends to refund the payments or pass the
benefits on to the retail client. An appropriate charging structure for calculating the adviser charge
must be used.

- COBS 6.2B contains rules on describing advice services that apply to firms providing investment
advice to retail clients in the United Kingdom in relation to financial instruments, structured
deposits or other retail investment products or basic advice to retail clients in the United Kingdom
(as well as to firms providing investment advice in the course of MiFID business in relation to
financial instruments and structured deposits, since COBS 6.2B also implements aspects of
MiFID II). In particular, firms holding themselves out as providing independent advice must assess
a sufficient and diverse range of relevant products available on the market. A firm must also
disclose to a client whether its advice will be independent advice or restricted advice; whether the
advice will be based on a broad or more restricted analysis of different types of relevant products;
and, where the advice will be restricted advice, whether the range will be limited to relevant
products issued or provided by entities having close links or relationships with the firm.

- The FCA Training and Competence sourcebook requires retail investment advisers to meet
specific requirements, including requirements in respect of continuing professional development,
appropriate qualifications and professional standing.

- The UK PRIIPs Regulation (as defined below), requires manufacturers of packaged retail
investment products and insurance-based investment products to provide a key information
document (“KID”) containing certain pre-contract product disclosures to retail consumers when
they are considering buying a PRIIP.

**_Client Assets_**

Principle 10 of the FCA’s Principles for Businesses requires firms to arrange adequate protection for
assets when the firm is responsible for them. The FCA’s Client Assets Sourcebook (“CASS”)
elaborates on this requirement, setting out the rules that apply to firms that are permitted to hold client
money and assets.

The requirements set out in CASS aim to protect money and assets belonging to a firm’s clients from
the insolvency of that firm and to ensure that, if a firm is subject to insolvency proceedings, client
money and assets can be promptly returned to the client. The rules seek to achieve this by requiring
firms to keep client money and assets separate from their own, by preventing firms from using client
money and assets for their own purposes and by requiring firms to keep records of the client money
and assets that they do hold.

**_Prudential Requirements_**

Regulatory capital requirements form an integral part of the FCA’s prudential supervision of True
Potential’s solo regulated UK-authorised firms. The FCA has detailed rules relating to the maintenance
of minimum levels of regulatory capital for authorised firms, which amplify the general principle under
which a firm must maintain adequate financial resources in order to be able to meet its liabilities as they
fall due. The adequacy of a firm’s financial resources is assessed in relation to the particular risks to


-----

which the firm may be exposed, given its business activities. The FCA also expects firms to take a
proactive approach to monitoring and managing risks.

Regulatory capital requirements exist on two levels. The first is a solo requirement aimed at individual
authorised entities (with the relevant firm being required to submit periodic returns to demonstrate
compliance with the relevant requirement). The second is a consolidated (or group) requirement and
relates to a part of, or the entirety of, the group of which an authorised firm or firms form part. The solo
prudential requirements that apply to FCA-authorised firms depend on the FCA’s prudential
classification of individual firms. This in turn depends on the level of risk involved in performing the
activities the relevant entity is authorised to perform.

The UK CRR, which forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act, previously applied to all investment firms. The meaning of the term “investment firm” for these
purposes is narrower than the meaning of the same term under MiFID II. The FCA categorised
investment firms for prudential purposes according to services and activities performed. Investment
firms meeting the narrower UK CRR definition were subject to regulatory capital requirements set out
in UK CRR, in the Prudential sourcebook for Investment Firms and GENPRU in the FCA Handbook.
Other MiFID II investment firms that do not meet this definition – in particular Building Societies and
Investment Firms (“BIPRU”), local firms and exempt CAD firms – were instead subject to less stringent
rules set out in the FCA Handbook in the Prudential sourcebook for Banks, BIPRU and GENPRU, or in
the Interim Prudential sourcebook for Investment Businesses, depending on their prudential
categorisation.

As a general matter, most investment firms are required to hold a sum of initial capital and additional
amounts against operating risk and (if relevant) interest rate, market and counterparty risks. A firm’s
capital requirements may increase, which may affect return on capital for investors. As at 1 January
2022, the IFPR (including the Prudential sourcebook for MiFID investment firms) has replaced the UK
CRR regime as regards capital requirements for UK investment firms other than PRA-designated
investment firms. The IFPR regime set out a new methodology for the calculation of capital
requirements, based on “K-factors”, which are applied to a firm depending on the nature of the
activities it undertakes and the permissions that it holds; specifically, the IFPR sets out “risk to
customer” K-factors that are potentially applicable to all firms, based on AUM, client money held,
assets safeguarded and administered, and client orders handled (i.e. orders received/transmitted or
executed for clients); additional K-factors apply where a firm holds permission to deal as principal,
relating to “risk to market” and “risk to firm” categories. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Regulation—Compliance with the Investment Firms Prudential Regime may involve costs and could_
_result in burdens on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_
_condition, results of operations and prospects”._

**_Data Protection_**

Firms that handle personal data and therefore classify as a “controller” or “processor” must comply
with the requirements established by the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 in relation to
processing the personal data of our customers. When GDPR became applicable in all Member States
from 25 May 2018, it made substantial changes to the EU data protection regime. The GDPR set a
higher standard for personal data protection. The Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) is an
independent authority responsible for maintaining, upholding and promoting the best business
practices and legislative requirements for processing personal data and safeguarding the information
rights of individuals and their rights to access their personal data. Any business processing personal
data must pay a data protection fee to the ICO, unless it is exempt. True Potential maintains and
processes significant amounts of personal data; therefore, it therefore maintains a data protection
policy and has established data protection processes to comply with the requirements of the UK GDPR
and the Data Protection Act 2018 and the applicable guidance issued from time to time by the ICO,
such as the handling of data subject access requests from individuals. The ICO is empowered to
impose requirements or stop orders, issue monetary fines and prosecute criminal offences under the
Data Protection Act 2018.


-----

As a controller, True Potential are subject to requirements under the UK GDPR. Obligations are placed
on both controllers and entities that process data on behalf of controllers (“processors”). True Potential
is subject to the UK GDPR both as “controllers” and “processors”. True Potential must comply with and
demonstrate compliance with a set of data protection principles under the UK GDPR. The principles
include, among others, obligations to process data lawfully, fairly and transparently, to collect data for
specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, to collect the least amount of data required to fulfil the
relevant purpose, to keep accurate and up to date data, to keep data in a form which permits the
identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary and to process data in a secure manner.
Firms also need to ensure that they comply with other requirements of the UK GDPR, which include,
among other things, changes to the rules on how consent is provided by data subjects for processing
their data, providing information notices to data subjects about how their data is processed, and
impact assessments on our data protection systems and policies, and an obligation to notify data
breaches. Under UK GDPR, the maximum fine that can be imposed as a penalty for a breach of its
terms is the greater of 4% of total worldwide annual turnover or £17.5 million. In addition, regulators
are currently particularly focused on data security and protection of personal data from systems failure
or cyber-crime.

**_Consumer Complaints and Compensation_**

_Financial Ombudsman Service_

UK-authorised firms fall under the compulsory jurisdiction of the FOS, which is a body established
under the FSMA. Authorised firms are required to have adequate complaints handling procedures in
place but, where these are exhausted and the complaint or dispute has not been resolved, the FOS
provides for dispute resolution in respect of certain categories of customer complaints brought by
individuals and small business customers. Firms covered by the FOS are required to pay levies and
case fees, which provides the funding for the FOS.

_Financial Services Compensation Scheme_

The FSCS, established under the FSMA, seeks to protect customers of UK-authorised firms that are
unable or unlikely to be able to meet their financial obligations to customers. The FSCS provides
compensation to certain categories of customer who suffer loss as a consequence of the failure by a
regulated firm to meet its liabilities arising from claims made in connection with regulated activities. The
FSCS is funded by way of levies imposed on all of its participating financial services firms.

**_On-shored EU Regulation_**

_Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II_

MiFID II (the UK implementation of which remains part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue
of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) and MiFIR (which applied from the same date and forms
part of domestic law in the United Kingdom (as “UK MiFIR”) by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018) set out the framework for the regulation of firms in the United Kingdom that
engage in certain investment activities, such as (in certain circumstances) investment advice and
portfolio management. The UK implementation of MiFID II and UK MiFIR, which are intended to make
financial markets more efficient and resilient, increases transparency of both equity and non-equity
markets, reinforces supervisory powers, and strengthens investor protection, set out detailed and
specific requirements relating to investment firms within their scope, including provisions relating to
systems and controls, outsourcing, customer classification, conduct of business, costs and charges
disclosure, product governance, conflicts of interest, best execution, client order handling, suitability
and appropriateness, transparency and transaction reporting.

UK MiFID II and UK MiFIR contain requirements relating to transaction reporting, costs and charges
disclosure, product governance and conduct of business that affect True Potential’s operations. True
Potential has identified the impacts of MiFID II and has implemented changes to systems and business
practices. In the United Kingdom, aspects of MiFID II were also extended to firms not otherwise


-----

governed by MiFID, such as AIFMs and UCITS managers. This includes the ban on soft commission
and detailed telephone taping requirements.

The UK government has established a Wholesale Markets Review, which makes proposals for possible
amendments to aspects of the UK’s implementation of MiFID II. See “—Wholesale Markets Review”
below.

**_Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive_**

The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) (the UK implementation of which
remains part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) sets
out the framework for the regulation of the management of certain non-UCITS collective investment
undertakings. The UK implementation of AIFMD applies to AIFMs, that is, to legal persons whose
regular business it is to manage an alternative investment fund (“AIF”) within the meaning of AIFMD.
In broad terms, an AIF is a non-UCITS collective investment undertaking that raises capital from a
number of investors with a view to investing it in accordance with a defined investment policy for the
benefit of those investors.

The UK implementation of AIFMD covers matters such as authorisation, capital requirements, conduct
of business standards, remuneration, the valuation of assets, delegation, depositaries, transparency
and marketing.

**_Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive_**

The UCITS Directive (the UK implementation of which remains part of domestic law in the UK by virtue
of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) sets out the framework for the regulation of UCITS and
UCITS management companies. The UK implementation of the UCITS Directive includes rules on
authorisation, the operation of management companies, depositaries, mergers and investment
policies, and on the information that must be provided to investors. It also requires UCITS management
companies to establish and apply remuneration policies and practices consistent with sound and
effective risk management.

**_PRIIPs Regulation_**

The PRIIPs Regulation applied in EU member states from 1 January 2018, now forms part of domestic
law in the UK (as the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
The UK PRIIPs Regulation requires manufacturers of PRIIPs to provide a KID containing certain precontract product disclosures to retail consumers when they are considering buying a PRIIP. The KID
must provide a comprehensible explanation of the PRIIP, as well as enable retail investors to compare
the KID with other similar investment product KIDs and is intended to enable investors to make more
informed investment choices. This includes, for example, details of future performance scenarios and
the assumptions made to produce them but does not include details of past performance.

PRIIPs include both packaged retail investment products (that is, investment products in relation to
which the amount repayable to the retail investor fluctuates because of exposure to reference values
or to the performance of one or more assets that are not directly purchased by the retail investor) and
insurance-based investment products (that is, insurance products that offer a maturity or surrender
value that is directly or indirectly exposed to market fluctuations). Subject to limited transitional
provisions, this includes products such as units in an investment fund, life insurance policies with an
investment element and structured deposits.

The FCA has consulted on targeted amendments to the UK PRIIPs regime and intends to publish a
policy statement in Q1 2022. See “—Proposed amendments to the UK PRIIPs Regulation” below.

**_Capital Requirements Directive IV and Regulation_**

The CRD IV package (the UK implementation of which remains part of domestic law in the UK by virtue
of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) sets out the EU framework for the regulation of credit
institutions and certain investment firms, applicable in the main since January 2014, in particular in


-----

respect of capital adequacy. Certain MiFID investment firms and, in particular, those with permissions
relating to the safeguarding of client assets or handling of client money, are subject to the UK
implementation of CRD IV as regards prudential and capital standards.

**_Fourth and Fifth Money Laundering Directives_**

The Fifth Money Laundering Directive (“MLD5”) (the UK implementation of which remains part of
domestic law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) made key amendments
to the Fourth Money Laundering Directive (“MLD4”), including extensions to the scope of the regime
to keep track with evolving technology and clarifications to due diligence requirements for high-risk
countries. MLD5 also provided for greater enforcement powers and new provisions on cooperation
between anti-money laundering authorities to promote enforcement practices.

MLD4 entered into force on 25 June 2015 and was required to be transposed into UK law by 26 June
2017. Key changes introduced by MLD4 include changes to the scope of the anti-money laundering
regime, measures designed to provide enhanced clarity and accessibility with regard to beneficial
owner information, and a tightening of the rules on when simplified due diligence can be used. MLD4
(as amended by MLD5) applies to all of the regulated entities in the True Potential group.

**_Market Abuse Regulation_**

The FCA has the power to impose fines and other civil sanctions on individuals and firms that commit
market abuse. The definition of market abuse is set out in the Market Abuse Regulation, which
repealed and replaced the Market Abuse Directive and its implementing legislation with effect from
3 July 2016 and now forms part of domestic law in the UK (as “UK MAR”) by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. UK MAR refers to three abusive behaviours which, when committed in
relation to publicly traded financial instruments, commodity derivatives or emission allowances,
constitute market abuse. The relevant behaviours are insider dealing, the unlawful disclosure of inside
information and market manipulation.

The FCA may impose an unlimited fine on any person that engages in market abuse, or who has
encouraged or required another person to do so. As an alternative to imposing a fine, the FCA may
publish a statement of public censure or apply to the court under the FSMA for an injunction or
restitution order. The FCA also has the power to impose other administrative sanctions, including the
power to enter premises under a warrant and the power to cancel or suspend trading in financial
instruments.

In addition to the civil regime under the FSMA and MAR, the FCA has the power to prosecute the
criminal offences of insider dealing under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the criminal offences of
making false or misleading statements and creating a false or misleading impression in relation to
specified benchmarks under the FS Act.

One of the Principles requires a firm at all times to observe proper standards of market conduct. See
“—Principles for Businesses and Fundamental Rules” above.

**_Insurance Distribution Directive_**

IDD came into force on 22 February 2016 and was required to be implemented by 23 February 2018.
The UK’s implementation of IDD remains part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The UK’s implementation of IDD provides for the authorisation
of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries on the basis of minimum professional and financial
requirements and imposes requirements on insurance intermediaries to provide specified minimum
information to potential customers. It also contains organisational and conduct of business rules
applicable to insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

IDD amended and replaced the Insurance Mediation Directive. The IDD significantly raises the
minimum standards set out in the Insurance Mediation Directive and is intended to strengthen
policyholder protection and make it easier for firms to provide services cross-border.


-----

**_European Market Infrastructure Regulation_**

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) (which came into force on 16 August 2012
and now forms part of domestic law in the UK (as “UK EMIR”) by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018) introduced a number of requirements for counterparties to derivative
transactions, including (i) the mandatory obligation to clear certain classes of over-the-counter (“OTC”)
derivative contracts via a central counterparty (“CCP”); (ii) risk mitigation requirements relating to
uncleared OTC derivative contracts including collateral exchange and daily valuation; and (iii) reporting
and recordkeeping obligations for all derivatives contracts. The application of UK EMIR requirements
to a derivatives counterparty pairing will depend on the classification of the counterparties to such
derivative transactions. The initial margin compliance date for the most systemically important
counterparties was 4 February 2017, with the compliance date for other in-scope counterparties being
phased in from 1 September 2017 to 1 September 2022 (following amendments to incorporate a final
implementation phase and amendments to delay implementation following the COVID-19 pandemic).
The phase-in of clearing requirements for certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps
has taken place. There have since been packages of amendments to EMIR and UK EMIR, in particular
“EMIR Refit”, which made amendments including reclassifying certain counterparties, and “EMIR 2.2”,
which made amendments including in relation to the authorisation and supervision of third country
CCPs.

**_Securities Financing Transactions Regulation_**

The Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (“SFTR”), which entered into force on 12 January
2016 and now forms part of domestic law in the United Kingdom (as “UK SFTR”) by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act, imposes a number of requirements on the parties to securities
financing transactions (“SFTs”) and other market participants including (i) reporting and
record-keeping requirements for certain counterparties to SFTs; (ii) limitations on the reuse of collateral
(not only in the securities financing markets but also in the wider collateral markets); and (iii) new
investor disclosure rules for management companies of UCITS, UCITS investment companies and
AIFMs.

In broad terms, the UK SFTR requires the conclusion, modification or termination of an SFT to be
reported to a trade repository which is registered or recognised in accordance with the SFTR.
Counterparties are also required to keep a record of any SFT that they have concluded, modified or
terminated for at least five years following the termination of a relevant transaction. An SFT is defined
as (i) a repurchase transaction; (ii) securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities
borrowing; (iii) a buy-sell back transaction or sell-buy back transaction; and (iv) a margin lending
transaction, each as further defined in the UK SFTR.

A right of reuse of financial instruments received as collateral is subject to at least both of the following
conditions: (i) risks and consequences have been communicated in writing; and (ii) prior express
consent of the providing counterparty has been granted. In addition, the exercise of a right of reuse is
subject to meeting at least both of the following conditions: (i) reuse is undertaken in accordance with
the terms specified in the relevant collateral arrangement; and (ii) financial instruments are transferred
from the account of the providing counterparty.

UK SFTR imposes investor disclosure rules for management companies of UCITS, UCITS investment
companies and AIFMs in respect of the use they make of SFTs and total return swaps in periodical
reports and in precontractual documents.

**Recent and Future Regulatory Developments**

**_Brexit_**

Following a referendum vote on 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom exercised Article 50 of the Treaty
on the European Union, which gives a member state the right to withdraw from the European Union,
and gave the European Union a formal notice that it will leave the European Union. The United
Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. local time. At that time, the EU treaties


-----

ceased to apply to the United Kingdom. As part of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the
United Kingdom and the European Union, a transitional period was agreed which extended the
application of EU law and provided for continuing membership of the EU single market until
31 December 2020.

Following 31 December 2020, the transitional period expired, and EU law ceased to apply in the United
Kingdom. On 24 December 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on the Trade
and Cooperation Agreement, which sets out the principles of the relationship between the European
Union and the United Kingdom following the end of the transitional period. The Trade and Cooperation
Agreement took effect provisionally from 1 January 2021 pending formal ratification from the European
Union and the United Kingdom. The UK Parliament ratified the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on
30 December 2020 and the European Parliament on behalf of the European Union ratified it on 28 April
2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not replace the withdrawal agreement.

Explicit agreement on future access in the financial services sector was not included in the Trade and
Co-operation Agreement, and so the future framework between the European Union and United
Kingdom in this space is not currently certain. Future regulatory divergence and further legal
uncertainty are possible. The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union is likely to significantly
affect the political, fiscal, legal and regulatory landscape in the United Kingdom and could have a
material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries. The impact on the UK
economy could reduce, amongst other things: its share of world exports compared with the United
States, and the number of the world’s top 100 multi-national companies headquartered in the United
Kingdom. Although it is not possible to predict fully the effects of the United Kingdom’s exit from the
European Union, it could have a material adverse effect on, amongst other things, UK fund managers,
companies and investors, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on the business of True
Potential.

**_Wholesale Markets Review_**

In July 2021, HM Treasury published a consultation on the Wholesale Markets Review, which was
established to examine the need for the United Kingdom to adapt its regulation of wholesale markets
following its departure from the European Union.

Proposals under consideration as part of the Review include the removal of the share trading
obligation, a reduction in the scope of the position limits regime, amendments to the scope of the
derivatives trading obligation, clarifications and revisions to the scope of the pre- and post-trade
transparency regimes and amendments to the tick size regime.

The consultation on the Wholesale Markets Review closed in September 2021 and HM Treasury will
respond in due course, with FCA consultations to follow in the first and second quarter of 2022. HM
Treasury will consider responses to the consultation in parallel with the Future Regulatory Framework
Review, which has been established to examine the need for the United Kingdom to adapt its financial
regulatory framework generally following its departure from the European Union.

**_Review of the UK Funds Regime_**

In January 2021, HM Treasury published a call for input relating to its review of the UK funds regime.
The review covers (in addition to fund taxation issues) the UK’s approach to funds regulation and
opportunities for wider reform on issues cutting across tax and regulatory issues relevant to the UK
fund regime. As regards the UK’s approach to fund regulation, the call for input requests stakeholder
input on issues including the benefits of fund authorisation, timescales for fund authorisation, the
qualified investor scheme fund structure and operational efficiency. In the context of wider input, the
call for input requests input in particular on enhancing the attractiveness of the UK funds regime and
whether it should focus on appealing to AIFs targeting international markets, spreading the benefits of
fund administration across the UK, enhancing existing fund structures and new fund structures.

The call for input closed in April 2021 and the government intends to consult on specific proposals for
reform once it has analysed responses to the call for input.


-----

**_Proposed Amendments to the UK PRIIPs Regulation_**

In July 2021, the FCA published a consultation paper consulting on targeted amendments to address
concerns relating to the UK PRIIPs disclosure regime. In particular, the consultation proposes
amendments that seek to clarify the scope of the UK PRIIPs Regulation to address concerns about
uncertainty relating to the application of the regime to corporate bonds, in particular those which have
features such as make-whole clauses and change of control puts. The consultation also proposes to
replace the requirement for the presentation of performance scenarios in a KID with a requirement
to include a narrative description of performance, to address misleading summary risk indicators and
to address concerns with the calculation methodology for transaction costs. The consultation closed
in September 2021 and the FCA intends to publish a policy statement in Q1 2022.

**_Consultation on the Regulation of Non-transferable Debt Securities (Mini-bonds)_**

In April 2021, HM Treasury published a consultation pertaining to the regulation of illiquid nontransferable debt securities often referred to as “mini-bonds”. The consultation examines the case for
further regulation of direct-to-market issuance of mini-bonds and proposes two policy options, the first
of which is making the issuance of mini-bonds a regulated activity under the FSMA and the second of
which is extending the scope of the UK Prospectus Regulation to cover public offers of mini-bonds.
The consultation closed in July 2021.

**_Sustainable Finance Legislation_**

Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector
(“SFDR”) entered into force on 29 December 2019. Most of its provisions have applied in the European
Union since 10 March 2021.

It applies to AIFMs and contains transparency and disclosure requirements, including:

- what firms must disclose and maintain on their websites;

- the information that must be provided to investors; and

- periodic reporting to investors.

The SFDR forms part of a package of reforms relating to sustainable finance (including for example
Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regards EU climate transition
benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned benchmarks and sustainability-related disclosures for benchmarks (the
“Low Carbon Benchmark Regulation”) and the EU's Regulation on the establishment of a framework
to facilitate sustainable investment (the “Taxonomy Regulation”)).

Following ESMA’s May 2019 final report on technical advice to the European Commission on
integrating sustainability risks and factors in the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD (ESMA34-45-688), the
European Commission adopted a delegated regulation to amend the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation.

Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1255 of 21 April 2021, amending Delegated Regulation
(EU) No 231/2013 as regards sustainability risks and sustainability factors to be taken into account by
alternative investment fund managers, amends the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation to include the
consideration of sustainability risks in due diligence requirements, to require AIFMs to retain the
necessary resources and expertise for the effective integration of sustainability risks, and to state that
the identification of conflicts of interest must also include those conflicts of interest that may arise as a
result of the integration of sustainability risks. The amendments will also require senior management
of AIFMs to be responsible for the integration of sustainability risks and will require risk management
policies to consider exposures to sustainability risks.

The United Kingdom has not fully onshored these EU sustainable finance reforms. However, similar
themes are emerging in legislative and policy development in the United Kingdom. For example, in
June 2021, the UK government appointed a green technical advisory group, which is tasked with
overseeing the UK government’s development of a UK Green Taxonomy. The United Kingdom will also
have its own sustainability disclosure framework.

###### CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We enter into transactions with our shareholders and other entities owned by, or affiliated with, our
direct and indirect shareholders in the ordinary course of business. In addition, it is contemplated that
new related party transactions will be entered into in connection with the Transactions. The following
summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual underlying agreements.

We believe that all transactions with subsidiaries are negotiated and executed on an arm’s-length basis
and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated
third-party suppliers and service providers.

###### DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS

_Set forth below is a summary of certain of our future significant debt arrangements. The following_
_summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to,_
_the underlying documents. The terms defined in this section apply to this section only._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

Capitalised terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings given to them in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Overview and Structure_**

On the Completion Date, the Issuer as company (the “Company”) and original guarantor (the
“Guarantor”), Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, London Branch,
Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland International
Limited, London Branch and SMBC Bank International PLC as mandated lead arrangers (together, the
“Mandated Lead Arrangers”), Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs International Bank, UBS
AG, London Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, Royal Bank of Scotland
International Limited and SMBC Bank International PLC as original lenders, The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch as agent (the “Agent”) and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited as
security agent entered into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement (the “Revolving Credit
**Facility Agreement”).**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount
of £100.0 million on a committed basis (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility
may be utilised by any current or future borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Revolving
Credit Facility in GBP, euro or USD together with other currencies consented to by all of the relevant
lenders or, in the case of an additional facility, as specified in the applicable additional facility notice by
the drawing of cash advances or, subject to the appointment of an issuing bank, the issue of bank
guarantees and documentary credits (including letters of credit, performance bonds, bid bonds,
advance payment bonds and warranty bonds) and by way of ancillary facilities or fronted ancillary
facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time.
The borrowings will be available to be used towards (i)(A) the financing or refinancing of the general
corporate and/or working capital requirements of the Group including, without limitation, the financing
or refinancing of permitted acquisitions, acquisition costs and other permitted investments including
capital expenditure, joint ventures, operational restructurings, permitted reorganisations, restructuring
costs, (B) the financing or refinancing of indebtedness of the Group, the Target Group or any
acquisition target (including to backstop or provide cash cover in respect of any existing ancillary
facilities, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, revolving, working capital or local facilities and other
arrangements) and (C) the payment of all fees, costs, expenses and/or other liabilities (including,
without limitation, any break costs, redemption premium and make-whole costs) incurred in
connection with the Acquisition, the finance documents, the Transaction and/or any such repayment,
refinancing, discharge and/or close-out, and (ii) cash over-funding on the closing date and the
payment of any amounts identified in the tax structure memorandum or funds flow statement relating
to the Transaction.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates the incurrence of additional uncommitted
revolving facilities in a maximum amount not to exceed (after taking account of the commitments under
the Revolving Credit Facility) the amount able to be incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Indebtedness”,
whether as a new facility and/or as an additional tranche of any existing facility and/or by increasing
the commitments under an existing facility. Such additional facilities shall rank _pari passu with the_
Revolving Credit Facility and be prepaid on a _pro rata basis (including with respect to mandatory_
prepayments). The lenders of any such additional facilities shall not have the benefit of (x) guarantees


-----

from any member of the Group which is not a borrower or guarantor or (y) security over assets other
than the then existing Collateral, except where the same security (to the extent permitted by law) is
granted in respect of the other facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the availability, maturity, pricing and
other terms of any additional facility will be those agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders
of that additional facility, provided that no additional facility may have a maturity date that is earlier than
the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility except for any additional facilities where the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility are offered a right to amend the maturity date of the Revolving
Credit Facility to a date on or prior to the final maturity date of such additional facilities, provided that
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility will be deemed to have declined such offer and
consented to the proposed maturity date of such additional facility unless the majority of lenders
(calculated for these purposes by reference only to lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility) have
notified the Agent that they accept such offer or reject such offer and do not consent to the proposed
maturity date of such additional facility, in each case, by 11.00 a.m. on the date falling five business
days (or such longer period which the Issuer proposes) after the date of such offer. An additional facility
may be established by the delivery of an additional facility notice signed by the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilised
from the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement until the date falling four years and nine
months after the Completion Date.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer is the original borrower and original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. A mechanism is included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of
the Issuer’s subsidiaries to accede as a borrower and/or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility
subject to certain conditions. There is no requirement under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
for any affiliates of the Issuer to accede as a borrower or a guarantor at any time.

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling four years and nine months after the
Completion Date, being approximately three months prior to the maturity of the Notes. Each advance
will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism
against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit
Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be
re-borrowed during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the rate per annum equal
to the aggregate of the applicable margin and (in relation to cash advances in sterling) the SONIA
compounded reference rate, or the applicable margin and (in relation to cash advances in euro)
EURIBOR, or the applicable margin and (in relation to cash advances in USD) the SOFR compounded
reference rate.

The initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.50% as at the closing date and subject
to the ratchet described below.

Beginning from the first day following the first complete Financial Quarter after the closing date,
provided that no non-payment or insolvency or insolvency-related event of default, or an event of
default as a result of a failure to deliver a compliance certificate, has occurred and is continuing, the
margin on the loans will be reduced if certain senior secured net leverage ratios are met.


-----

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from (and including) the closing date to (and including) the last day of the availability
period for the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving
Credit Facility. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of the availability
period of the Revolving Credit Facility and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount of the relevant
lender’s commitment at the time the cancellation is effective. No commitment fee shall be payable
unless the closing date occurs.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent and the security agent in
connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, customary fees in connection with the issuance of letters
of credit and on the closing date will pay an arrangement fee to the Mandated Lead Arrangers.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer will provide senior guarantees (subject to local law limitations in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) of all amounts payable to (x) the finance parties by the Issuer, or as applicable, any of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional
borrower or an additional guarantor, (y) the hedging banks under certain secured hedging agreements
(pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement) and (x) the cash management facility lenders under certain
cash management facilities (pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements). There is no requirement to
accede additional companies as guarantors to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Security_**

It is expected that on the closing date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by security over
certain assets of Kane Midco Limited (“Midco”, being the direct holding company of the Issuer) in the
capacity of Third-Party Security Provider. Security to be provided by Midco on the closing date shall
be limited to a security interest agreement in respect of its shares in the capital of the Issuer and any
structural intercompany receivables owed to it (as lender) by the Issuer (as borrower).

No later than the date which is 30 days after (and excluding) the closing date, the Issuer shall grant
(i) security over each of its material bank accounts, and (ii) a pledge over the shares it holds in the
Target and any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer (as lender) by the Target (as
borrower).

To the extent that other entities accede as borrowers or guarantors in the future, the relevant entity will
provide additional security in accordance with (and subject to) the agreed security principles set out
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral
(whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on a super senior basis prior to
repayment of the Notes.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties,
subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and
baskets, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status;
(ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and
admissibility in evidence; (vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) filing and stamp taxes,
(viii) management case and reports; (ix) accuracy of most recent financial statements delivered; (x) no
litigation; (xi) taxation; and (xii) pari passu ranking.


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief
description of such covenants, all of which are subject to agreed materiality, actual knowledge or other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including
annual audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii) giving an annual
presentation to the finance parties on Group performance; (iii) access to books, accounts and records
whilst a material event of default is continuing; (iv) authorisations; (v) compliance with laws;
(vi) payment of taxes; (vii) maintenance of pari passu and priority and payment ranking of the Revolving
Credit Facility; (viii) further assurance provisions; and (ix) maintenance of a corporate family rating
and/or rating for the Notes and the Issuer.

**_Negative Covenants_**

The negative covenants include restrictions with respect to sanctions and anti-corruption. Otherwise,
the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same as the
negative covenants in the Indenture.

**_Release Condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a mechanism whereby if either (i) a listing has
occurred which does not constitute a change of control and the Group has achieved equal to or less
than an agreed senior secured net leverage ratio, or (ii) the Issuer or any holding company of the Issuer
receives a long-term corporate credit rating of “BBB-”/”Baa3” (as applicable) or higher from any two of
Fitch, Moody’s or S&P (the “Release Condition”), certain covenants and other terms under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall no longer apply whilst the Release Condition is continuing.
Relevant covenants include (but are not limited to) guarantee and security obligations, restrictions on
indebtedness, restrictions on restricted payments, restrictions on asset sales; the financial condition
drawstop shall only be tested semi-annually, baskets set by reference to monetary amounts shall be
increased by 50% per annum, the margin payable on any original Revolving Credit Facility loan,
additional facility loan or Unpaid Sum shall be reduced by 0.50% and the Collateral shall be released.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

The Issuer is required to notify the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement of a change of
control. Following which, at the Issuer’s option, unless otherwise agreed by the majority of lenders,
either (i) each lender and issuing bank shall be entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts
and the cancellation of its commitments within a prescribed time period, or (ii) all outstanding undrawn
commitments of each lender shall be immediately cancelled and outstanding drawn commitments
shall become due and payable together with accrued interest and other amounts accrued or owing to
each lender. The definition of a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall
be the same as that which applies to the Notes.

**_Financial Condition Drawstop_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a financial condition drawstop (the “Financial
**Condition Drawstop”) providing that the Issuer shall ensure that the super senior secured net**
leverage ratio in respect of each testing period ending after the closing date shall not exceed 1.875:1
as at 5.00 p.m. on such date. Failure to satisfy the Financial Condition Drawstop shall not (or be
deemed to) directly or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, but is relevant solely as a
drawstop to any future utilisations of the Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

The Financial Condition Drawstop will be tested quarterly in respect of each testing period ending on
31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December of each financial year, starting with the first quarter
date falling at the end of four complete financial quarters following the closing date, and only if the Test
Condition (as defined below) is met.

The Financial Condition Drawstop is not tested unless the aggregate outstanding amount of utilisations
(excluding all borrowings under any ancillary facility and any utilisation (i) made on or prior to the
closing date (and any rollover loan in respect thereof) and (ii) used to fund any acquisitions, capital
expenditure or other investments (and any rollover loans in respect thereof); _minus the aggregate_
amount of cash and cash equivalent investments held by the Group), exceeds 40% of the aggregate
of (i) the total commitments as at the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and (ii) the
aggregate of all commitments under any additional facility established after the date of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (disregarding, in each case, any reduction of commitments following the
establishment thereof) (the “Test Condition”).

In the event the Financial Condition Drawstop would not be complied with when tested, the Issuer may
apply new equity or subordinated debt to (i) increase EBITDA (the “EBITDA Cure”), (ii) decrease
Super Senior Secured Indebtedness, or (iii) prepay loans to cure the breach. The EBITDA Cure shall
not be exercised more than twice in any three consecutive quarters, or more than five times during the
life of the Facilities. The Issuer is also permitted to cure or prevent a breach of the Financial Condition
Drawstop by electing to recalculate the Test Condition or the Financial Condition Drawstop on any
subsequent date for which the Issuer has sufficient available information to effect the recalculation. If
the Financial Condition Drawstop has been breached but is complied with when tested on any
subsequent test date or the Test Condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date, then any prior
breach of the Financial Condition Drawstop shall be deemed to have been remedied.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for
certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality and other
qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) failure to pay
(a) any principal when due and (b) any other amount when due subject to a 30-day grace period;
(ii) failure to comply with any other provision of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement subject to a
60-day grace period; (iii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when made
or deemed repeated subject to a 20-business day grace period; (iv) unlawfulness and invalidity subject
to a 20-business day grace period; (v) failure to comply with a material term of, or breach of
representation or warranty by certain parties under, the Intercreditor Agreement subject to a
20-business day grace period; and (vi) certain events of default consistent with the insolvency events
of default, with certain adjustments, as under the Notes.

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be governed by English law provided that certain of the
information undertakings, negative covenants, events of default and New York law definitions listed in
the relevant schedules to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with
the law of the State of New York.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the
agent, arrangers and lenders under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the agent, arrangers and lenders

Borrower, such security shall be (i) limited to shares in and receivables owed to it by the relevant Topco
Borrower which are not required to be subject to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Finance

(iv) of this paragraph of a Topco Borrower and (to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed to the
Security Agent that the granting of such security in favour of the Topco Shared Security Secured
Obligations is not prohibited by the terms of any applicable prior ranking financing agreements) any
other member of the Group, in each case designated as Topco Shared Security by the Issuer (in its
discretion) in favour of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such
trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favour of all the Secured Parties or in favour of the
Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Shared Security shall secure all
liabilities and present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower that is not a member of the Group

Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured Parties), is created, or
expressed to be created, in favour of (x) all the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured Parties) in
respect of the applicable Secured Obligations or (y) the Security Agent under a parallel debt and/or
joint and several creditorship or similar structure for the benefit of all the Secured Parties (or a class of
Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations. Transaction Security which is not
Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and
Third-Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties (other than the creditors under the Topco
Liabilities (as defined below) (the “Topco Secured Parties”)) under the Secured Debt Documents
(other than the finance documents relating to the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Finance Documents”)).
Transaction Security which is Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future
obligations of any member of the Topco Group, the Debtors and Third-Party Security Providers to the
Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents (including to the Security agent under a parallel
debt) both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in
any other capacity (the “Topco Shared Security Secured Obligations”).

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any
Liabilities that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco
Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Pari passu Hedging Liabilities or unsecured liabilities (each a “New
**Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is**
not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set
off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing, guarantee
or debt arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate
any New Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security
Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent


-----

Transaction Security document) is authorised and instructed to enter promptly into any new security
document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from
the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to
effect the ranking, priority guarantees and Security of the New Debt Financing, subject to certain
conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise required
by the Issuer, substantially the same (if applicable) as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its
subsidiaries who, after the closing date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or
is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other
ownership interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the closing date (together
an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss
in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the
incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or
is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to
subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in
respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any
liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would
breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being
given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement), (ii) over
any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction
Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation
relating to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any
payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the
benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third-Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Bridge Liabilities and
Cash Management Facility Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities (together the “Senior Secured
**Creditor Liabilities” and the creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at**
any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the Revolving Facility Agreement,
the Bridge Facility Agreement, any Permitted Senior Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture
or Permitted Super Senior Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a
member of the Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third-Party Security Providers and
received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of
_Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other_
than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of
an event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

**_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_**

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Cash Management Facility
Liabilities and the Pari passu Hedging Liabilities (together, the “Senior Liabilities”), the Super Senior

-----

**Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the**
“Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the
members of the Group and Third-Party Security Providers may only make specified scheduled
payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents
governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalised
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including the Revolving Facility
Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, any Permitted Senior Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super
Senior Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that any
required consents to permit such payment have been obtained), no payment stop notice has been
issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject
to a _de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is_
continuing under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, any Permitted
Senior Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility
document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing.
These payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced as Topco Liabilities
in sub-paragraph (b) of the next paragraph.

**_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_**

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second
**Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority**
**Discharge Date”), the Issuer, any Topco Borrowers, Third-Party Security Providers and other members**

Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(iii) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalised interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect
of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or, if it is so prohibited, any
required consents to permit such payment have been obtained or (y) permitted as a Non
Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or the result of any claim which is subject to
Transaction Security, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalised
interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if
applicable, special interest or liquidated damages), the accrual of cash interest otherwise
payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is

Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor
or borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of clause (L)
below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated
their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing
agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the
payment is (without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but
whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents) (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter
relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and
professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of

for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco
Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding) which has been capitalised and added
to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of
the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any
such amount described at (C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain
events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or
would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the
Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing,
all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration
for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (“Debt for Equity Swap”) provided
that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does
not result in a change of control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco
Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Group to another member
of the Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer that
arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured

pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations
under the Topco Finance Documents, and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from


-----

Borrower from the Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment
is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a
Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or any other provision that
permits the repayment in full of any Topco Creditor (without a related requirement to repay all
other Topco Creditors) and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any
other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided

Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the
applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(c) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third-Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

**_Payment Obligations and Capitalisation of Interest Continue_**

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalisation of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party
that has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the
“Topco Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to
any payments which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for
that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a
result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action
being required.

**_Turnover by the creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been
fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than
a Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Group or Third-Party
Security Provider:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set
out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(b) any amount by way of set off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (A) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (B) as a result of any other


-----

litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Group or any Third-Party Security
Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below)); or

(ii) by way of set off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in
accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(e) (subject to certain exceptions) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of
or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Group or
Third-Party Security Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor, member of the Group or Third-Party
Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount
received or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the
Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly
pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, promptly pay
an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to
the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any
member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of
security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other
amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Revolving Facility Agreement) or Third-Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or
reorganisation (excluding solvent reorganisations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (c) (other than on a solvent basis) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or a
material part of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other
than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings discharged within 20 business days,
proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful
or as permitted under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, any Senior
Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super
Senior Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a
default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security


-----

Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds
of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The
Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out
under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider’s liabilities to creditors are,
with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set off shall pay an amount
equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set off to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds”
below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realisation proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorises the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make
recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Group or
Third-Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably
requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of
the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior
**Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super**
Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions
relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions
in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction
_Security” below;_

(b) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the
Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(c) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial
**Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge**
counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,


-----

(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the
Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by
enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith
that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realisation of proceeds and the Majority Super
Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior
Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the
Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not
to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal (as defined below), any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the
rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or
Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in respect of the Topco
Shared Security only) an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time
the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the
Security Agent instructions do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such
instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent
that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may
give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the
Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including
that to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximise the value realised from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds
must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over £2,000,000 or shares if not
carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent
is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit
from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party financial adviser.

_Enforcement — Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance
with its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce or refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as
any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any
such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).


-----

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the
Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with
the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group, (i) no Topco Creditor or Topco Investor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise
(to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of any Transaction Security (including the
crystallisation of any floating charge forming part of the Transaction Security); (ii) no Topco Creditor
nor Topco Investor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below)

Group Liabilities); and (iii) no Topco Creditor or Topco Investor nor Topco Borrower shall take or require
the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below) in relation to Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities,
except in the case of each of (i) through (iii) as set out under “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below
and provided that no such action required by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent
that such Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such
action.

Other than as restricted by (i) and (iii) in the paragraph above, any Topco Creditor may at any time take
any Enforcement Action (as defined below) available against any person that is not a member of the
Group, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Topco Finance Documents.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

(a) (i) in relation to any liabilities (other than unsecured liabilities) the acceleration, putting on

acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made;

(c) entering into any composition, compromise, assignment or similar arrangement with any
Third-Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which owes any liabilities or has
given any security, guarantee or indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of liabilities

Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy backs pursuant to open market debt repurchases,
tender offers or exchange offers entered into in accordance with the Secured Debt Documents,


-----

and not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring or turnaround plan or while a default
was outstanding under the relevant Secured Debt Document); or

(d) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking steps (including the appointment of any liquidator,
receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration
or reorganisation of any Third-Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which
owes any liabilities or has given any security, guarantees, indemnity or other assurance against
loss in respect of liabilities owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of such
Third-Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group’s assets or any suspension of
payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such Third-Party Security Provider or
member of the Topco Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action, (A) suing, commencing proceedings
or taking any action referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) or (d) above where necessary (but only to the extent
necessary) to preserve a claim, (B) discussions between or proposals made by any of the Secured
Parties with respect to enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, (C) bringing proceedings in connection with a securities violation, securities or listing
regulations or common law fraud or to restrain any breach of the Debt Documents or for specific
performance with no claims for damages, (D) proceedings brought by a Secured Party to obtain
injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to restrain any actual or

performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages or to request judicial
interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages,
(E) demands made by intra group lenders or Subordinated Creditors to the extent they relate to
payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or the release of the liabilities owed to such
creditors in return for the issue of shares in the relevant member of the Group provided that the
ownership interest of the member of the Group is not diluted and any relevant shares remain subject
to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue, (F) proceedings brought by an ancillary
lender, a lender of Cash Management Facility Liabilities (a “Cash Management Facility Lender”),
hedge counterparty, issuing bank, or agent or trustee in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities or Topco

any actual or putative breach of any Debt Document, to obtain specific performance (other than
specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages or to request
judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages or
to bring legal proceedings in connection with any securities violation, securities or listing regulations
or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative breach of the Secured Debt Documents or
for specific performance with no claims for damages and (G) the taking of any action by a member of
the Topco Group not prohibited by the Finance Documents.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

Subject to certain exceptions, the restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by
_Topco Creditors” will not apply in respect of any Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan_
Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing any Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(a) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(b) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
and Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco
Notes Trustee or the Topco Borrower;

(c) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and the Relevant Topco Default is
continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period (as defined below).

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco
Notes Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement


-----

Notice notifying any agent under the Revolving Facility Agreement or a Permitted Super Senior
Facilities Agreement (the “Super Senior Agent”) Permitted Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Senior
**Agent”), Bridge Facility Agreement (the “Bridge Agent”), Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Second**
Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start
**Date”) a Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending**
on the earliest to occur of:

(a) the date falling one hundred and seventy-nine (179) days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the
“Topco Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor
or Third-Party Security Provider, provided that:

(i) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Topco Creditors or a
Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the
same Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken
by the Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other
member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider; and

(ii) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph (b) shall not include action taken to
preserve or protect any security as opposed to realise it;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against whom
Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other
permitted remedy); and

(e) the first date on which the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the relevant
Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may
take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section “—Permitted Topco
_Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill_
Period or at any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event
of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving
not less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to themselves
of all, but not part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, Bridge Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender
Liabilities, Second Lien Notes Liabilities and Hedging Liabilities for the amount that would have been
required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco
Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging
obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have
been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain
costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to
a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that


-----

it shall (and is irrevocably authorised, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent,
agreement, instruction, direction, confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or
information from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written
request from the Issuer to the Security Agent:

(a) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(i) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the
Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
including a disposal to a member of the Group but without prejudice to any obligation
of any member of the Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security;
or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any
applicable release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance
Document pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of
the Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each
case, a “Non Distressed Disposal”);

(ii) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to the extent that the Issuer has
confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take
any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(iii) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member
of the Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor simultaneously with
such release to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or
guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement); and

(iv) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the
extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such
release is otherwise permitted, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement);

(b) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Group
or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of the
Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the
Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including
any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(c) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (b) above, the Issuer
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited
as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive
agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.


-----

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Group or
holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the
Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to
the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or
designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a
Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the
right to voluntarily prepay any or all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable
creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to
decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied to the extent that
if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such liabilities in full by such person (but
without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other payment
required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender
Liabilities (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or
otherwise transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt
Transfer is to another member of the Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that
Borrower or any holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the
Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied
unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents;
or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and (ii) the transferee in respect of
such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities,
Bridge Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender Liabilities (as
applicable). Any Debt Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Issuer) be effected on a cashless
basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and re-borrow any
applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued
by a member of the Group or, in the case of a Third-Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or
financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the
request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration
event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, or (c) after the
occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing, by a
Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third-Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third-Party Security Provider
or Debtor:

(a) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other
liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor
over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and
Debtors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by
that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor
over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding
company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors: (A) (if the Security Agent
(acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of
those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and

the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant
creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or
any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intragroup liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver
or enter into any agreement to: (A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra
group liabilities or liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra group lenders and
Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and (B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed
Entity which is also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or
part of the obligations in respect of those intra group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those
intra group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraph (d) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the
proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities
has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e)
above) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall


-----

not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorised to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be
paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorised to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien
Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other
Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made
the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions
described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other
liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer specified by such creditor, in which case the
Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without
any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such
documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (d) and (e) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless
the consent of each Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent, the Bridge Agent and each Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further condition to any release,
transfer or disposal that:

(a) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(b) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made: (A) pursuant to a
public auction or other competitive sale process conducted with the advice of a reputable,
independent and internationally recognised investment bank or firm of accountants or (if all such
banks or firms are conflicted, a reputable, independent and internationally recognised third-party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets
similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant Transaction Security) and, in each case, not
being an auditor or administrator or other relevant officer of the applicable company (a “Financial
**Adviser”) as selected by the Security Agent (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has**
no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser until it has been indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the Secured Creditors are
entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B) where a Financial Adviser selected
by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group
which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors,
the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non reliance basis) that the proceeds
received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser
unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).


-----

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e)) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release,
transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are
sold: (A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and
(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors
and unsecured creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed
of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold
or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates),
and all security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in
respect of the assets of such members of the Group is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent, each
Super Senior Agent, the Bridge Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and
in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater cash amount if
such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not
released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate
amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there
are no bidders, or if each Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent, the Bridge Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona
fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding
amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming
the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant
Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and (C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal
of any claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser
selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the
Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured
Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the
proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement
(it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any
Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security
securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions
described above, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:
(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and (B) at
the time of completion of the sale or disposal a Relevant Claim is (to the same extent)
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under documents creating security
in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such members of the Group is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that, if each Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent, the Bridge Agent, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities


-----

(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a
greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or
its affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than
the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the
case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent, the Bridge Agent,
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully
committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the
Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,
then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to
the purchaser or its affiliate; and (C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any
claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by
the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which
can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds
received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser
unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other
case on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

**_Application of Proceeds_**

discharge of (A) the Topco Facility Liabilities and liabilities to arrangers thereof, and (B) the Topco
Notes Liabilities, on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between themselves;

(g) if none of the Debtors or Third-Party Security Providers are under any further actual or contingent

Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider; and

(h) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider,

provided that, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent from or in

of the Intercreditor Agreement), in the following order of priority:

(i) in accordance with paragraph (a) above;

(ii) in accordance with paragraph (b) above;

Security Provider or Topco Independent Obligor; and

(e) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor, Third-Party Security Provider or Topco
Independent Obligor.

_Equalisation_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which certain
types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not
borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures
at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at
the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as
the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into
account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one
class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected
materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement
from the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging
counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order
of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made, subject to certain
exceptions, without the consent of:

(a) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under
the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Bridge Liabilities, the Second Lien
Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents);

(b) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management
Facility Lenders (solely in their capacity as such));

(c) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
any other creditor or class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their
capacity as such)); and

(d) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors
it represents or as otherwise authorised by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorisations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so
consented or authorised to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that
agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

Unless the Issuer agrees otherwise (in respect of any individual lender under the Revolving Facility
Agreement constituting a net short lender for the purposes of the Revolving Facility Agreement (a “Net
**Short Lender”)) the participations and commitments under the Revolving Facility Agreement of any**
Net Short Lender shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of both the numerator and the
denominator of the relevant percentage of the relevant credit participations or otherwise when
ascertaining whether the approval of or any instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, all
Senior Secured Creditors or any other class of Creditors (as applicable) have been obtained for all
purposes under the Finance Documents, including with respect to any request for a consent or
agreement or requirement for instructions to be given to the agent under the Revolving Facility
Agreement or the Security Agent.

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (including as described below), the
Security Agent (a) may, if the Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the Issuer, amend
the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any document
creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on
each party, and (b) may if the Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the Issuer, amend,
release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security where such amendment, release
and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction
Security, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register
any relevant document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859
of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment
or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment, release,
waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or
scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the
case may be) or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security are distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior
consent of:

(a) each of the agents or trustees (other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility), if
appointed in respect of any Senior Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Bridge Liabilities,
the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (acting in accordance with the relevant
finance documents);

(b) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility
on its behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the
Intercreditor Agreement in their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors;

(c) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of


-----

any other creditor or class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their
capacity as such)), and

(d) the Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers:
_Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement,_
relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security, claims or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the
Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financing”,
“—Non Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver
or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such
matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to:

(a) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(b) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a
similar snooze/lose provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(c) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(d) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

any creditor:

(i) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time
notified by the Issuer, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision
to operate is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(ii) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

(A) in the case of paragraphs (a) to (c) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case
may be) shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in
respect of the matter when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of their participation or has been obtained to give
that consent, carry that vote or approve that action;

(B) in the case of paragraphs (a) to (c) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded
for the purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of


-----

creditors has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action;
and

(C) in the case of paragraph (d) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to
have been given,

_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any
Noteholder in respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such
request in the negative but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

**_Provisions Following an IPO_**

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company thereof) (an
“IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to the release of Transaction Security
if required to implement such IPO Event), the Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent and each
hedge counterparty and each Cash Management Facility Lender (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the
terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the
relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group
(and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Group or holding company of the Issuer
who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown
**Entity”), provided that (x) if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the IPO Pushdown**
Date, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or
borrower of any Topco Liabilities and the Group will refer to the direct Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown
Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time and (y) if the Topco Notes have been refinanced
in full on or before the Pushdown Date (as defined below) but the Senior Secured Notes have not been
refinanced in full, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the “IPO
**Pushdown Group”), (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company**
of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO
Pushdown Entity, each reference in the Debt Documents to the Issuer or any holding company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent
applicable and unless the context requires otherwise), (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents
(including representations, undertakings and events of default), will cease to apply to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iv) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking of event of default, (v) any borrowing liabilities in respect of the Secured Debt
Documents will be (and will be deemed to have been) novated or otherwise transferred to a member
of the IPO Pushdown Group subject to certain conditions being met, (vi) each holding company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and
restrictions under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security), and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor,
Third-Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement) or Topco
Independent Obligor will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from its obligations and

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

_You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the_
_heading “—Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to the_
_“Issuer” refer only to Kane Bidco Limited and any successor obligor to the Issuer, and not to any of its_
_Subsidiaries; the term the “Target” refers only to True Potential Group Limited and any successor obligor_
_to the Target, and not to any of its Subsidiaries and the terms “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Group” refer to_
_the Issuer and, where the context so requires, certain or all of its Subsidiaries (including the Target and_
_its Subsidiaries)._

Kane Bidco Limited (the “Issuer”) will issue (i) £ –––––––– million in aggregate principal amount of
GBP-denominated –––––––– % Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the “GBP Notes”) and (ii) € ––––––––
million in aggregate principal amount of EUR-denominated –––––––– % Senior Secured Notes due
2027 (the “EUR Notes” and, together with the GBP Notes, the “Notes”) under an indenture (the
“Indenture”) to be dated as of –––––––– 2022 (the “Issue Date”), between, inter alios, the Issuer and
BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and security agent (the
“Security Agent”).

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with cash on the Issuer’s
balance sheet, will be used to repay and cancel the Bridge Facility and pay fees and expenses in
connection with the Offering and the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be secured on a
first-ranking basis by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined below). Within 30 days after the Completion
Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) also be secured by the Post-Completion
Date Collateral (as defined below). The Shared Collateral (as defined below) will also secure the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations on a super senior basis. See “—Security”.

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer. None of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries (including the Target and any of its Subsidiaries) will guarantee the Notes or have any
obligation to make any payment in respect of the Notes.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which £ –––––––– million aggregate
principal amount of GBP Notes and € –––––––– million aggregate principal amount of EUR Notes will
be issued on the Issue Date. After the Issue Date, we may issue an unlimited principal amount of
additional GBP Notes (the “Additional GBP Notes”) and/or additional EUR Notes (the “Additional
**EUR Notes” and, together with the Additional GBP Notes, the “Additional Notes”) having identical**
terms and conditions as the GBP Notes or EUR Notes, as applicable. We will only be permitted to issue
Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants and without triggering any defaults or events of
default contained in the Indenture, including the covenants, defaults and events of default restricting
the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Indebtedness”). The Notes issued on
the Issue Date and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes”,
references to the “Notes” include the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes that are
actually issued from time to time.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes,
any potential future Guarantees (as defined below) and the Indenture. Since this description of the
terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes and the Indenture for complete
descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. In addition, the following description refers
to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. Copies of such documents are available
from us upon request.

The Indenture and any Guarantee thereunder will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the


-----

Collateral securing the Notes and any Guarantee. Please see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

The Holder (as defined below) of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only Holders
will have rights under the Indenture. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. In addition, the Indenture will not
incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

- be secured as set forth below under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the obligations of the
Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- not be guaranteed by any Subsidiary or parent of the Issuer;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not
secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that do not guarantee the Notes; and

- be represented by one or more Notes in registered global form, which in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) (see “Book-Entry; Delivery
_and Form”)._

**_Potential Future Guarantees_**

The Notes will not be guaranteed as of the Issue Date. Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will only
guarantee the Notes if they guarantee other Indebtedness of the Issuer (subject to certain exceptions).
If such Restricted Subsidiaries do not provide a Guarantee (as defined below) in the circumstances
described under “—Future Guarantees”, it would constitute a default. For the purposes of this
“Description of the Notes”, “Guarantors” means any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Notes
in the future after the Issue Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto) and
“Guarantee” means the guarantee by each Guarantor of any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
and the Indenture. Any Guarantee of the Notes will, upon issuance:

- be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- be secured as set forth below under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee (including the
senior guarantee given in favour of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations,
if any);


-----

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured with property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor’s Guarantee, to the extent of
the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes.

Any obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful
financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin
capitalisation rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of
corporate law, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations
under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by
reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, any Guarantee will
be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._
Any Guarantee will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will apply
to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security
will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements. By virtue of these limitations, any Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a future Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

The Issuer is a newly formed holding company incorporated for the purposes of the Transactions, with
no material operations of its own and only limited assets. All of the operations of the Issuer are
conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Furthermore, none of the
Restricted Subsidiaries will initially guarantee the Notes and claims of creditors of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by
those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted
Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims
of creditors of the Issuer and any Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and any Guarantee
therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer and minority stockholders of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As at 30 September 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Target Group) would have had
£675.0 million of Indebtedness (as well as £100.0 million of availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility), none of which is incurred by any of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although it will
constitute a default and an event of default for the Issuer to Incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in excess of the provisions described under “—Indebtedness”, such limitations are
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on
the Incurrence by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Indebtedness”.

**_Releases of Guarantees_**

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;


-----

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Notes Documents or
upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance”
and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) in the case of a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally
released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, provided
_that Indebtedness will remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility after such release_
and discharge and (ii) would not otherwise be required at the time of such release to provide a
Guarantee pursuant to the provisions described under “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) as described in the second paragraph of the provision described under “—Future Guarantees”;
or

(8) as a result of a transaction permitted by, or that would not otherwise result in an event of default
pursuant to, the provisions described under “—Merger and Consolidation”.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. If requested to take action
under this provision, the Trustee and Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon
an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described
above, giving rise to a release of the Note Guarantee has occurred, and that such release complies
with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Principal and Maturity_**

The Issuer will issue £ ––––– million in aggregate principal amount of GBP Notes and € ––––– million
in aggregate principal amount of EUR Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will mature on ––––– 2027.
The GBP Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof. The EUR Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. While the GBP Notes may only be traded in
denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof and the EUR Notes
may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,
for the purpose of the International Central Securities Depositories (“ICSDs”), the minimum
denomination will be considered to be £1,000 for the GBP Notes and €1,000 for the EUR Notes. For
the avoidance of doubt, the ICSDs are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the GBP Notes will accrue at the rate of ––––– % per annum and interest on the EUR Notes
will accrue at the rate of ––––– % per annum. Interest on the Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
paid;

- be payable semi-annually in arrear on ––––– and –––––, commencing on ––––– 2022;

- be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the Clearing System Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date (where “Clearing System Business


-----

**Day” means a day on which each of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream**
Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) or such other clearing system for which the Global
Notes (as defined below) are being held is open for business); and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is
not a Clearing System Business Day or a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to
be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Clearing System Business Day or Business Day at such place, as applicable, and will not be entitled
to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Interest on overdue principal and interest, as applicable, will accrue at a rate that is 1.00% higher than
the then applicable rate of interest. In no event, however, will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher
than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Interest on the Notes shall be payable entirely in
cash.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Global Notes (as
defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided
_that all such payments with respect to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered_
in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on any certificated
securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or
more Paying Agents. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check
mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”.

All payments under the Notes will be subject in all cases to (i) any applicable fiscal or other laws,
regulations and directives, but without prejudice to the provisions described under “—Withholding
_Taxes”, and (ii) any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in_
Section 1471(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471
to 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, any amendments or regulations thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, or any law implementing any inter-governmental approach thereto (in each
case, without prejudice to the provisions described under “—Withholding Taxes”).

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”)
and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon,
Dublin Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The
Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from
time to time, if any, and the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on
behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice
to the Holders of such Notes. However, if and for so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of the
International Stock Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the International Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change of Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes.


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
**Notes”).**

The Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully
under “Notice to Investors”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of the
United States and any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and
after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes representing the GBP Notes are issued, they will be issued only in
minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess
thereof and, if Definitive Registered Notes representing the EUR Notes are issued, they will be issued
only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any
certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such
instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from
the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in
exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined
by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to,
the restrictions on transfer summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.


-----

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, the Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000
in principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the GBP Notes
and in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof with respect to the EUR Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay
any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed
in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date
applicable to the Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer (as defined below) or an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below).

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Notes and upon the occurrence of the Issue Date, all of the
Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be secured on a firstranking basis by:

(a) a pledge of all of the issued shares of Capital Stock of the Issuer held by Kane Midco Limited (the
“Parent”) (the “Issuer Share Collateral”); and

(b) a security interest in all receivables owed to the Parent (as lender) by the Issuer (as borrower),

(collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 30 days after the Completion Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) also
be secured on a first-ranking basis by:

(a) a security interest in all material bank accounts of the Issuer;

(b) a pledge of all shares of Capital Stock of the Target owned by the Issuer; and

(c) an assignment of all receivables owed to the Issuer (as lender) by the Target (as borrower),


-----

(collectively, the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the
“Collateral” or the “Shared Collateral”).

The security interests in the Collateral that is created by the Security Documents and secures
obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee and the Indenture are herein referred to as “Security
**Interests”.**

Subject to certain Permitted Collateral Liens, the Shared Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the
Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are
secured by the Shared Collateral, including, on a first priority basis, the Holders, the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any. Any liabilities
in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations would
receive priority over the Notes and any Guarantee with respect to any proceeds received from the
enforcement of the Shared Collateral or certain distressed disposals. Any proceeds received upon any
such enforcement would, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid and
such Hedging Obligations have been discharged in full, be applied _pro rata in repayment of all_
obligations under the Notes and any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Shared Collateral on a
_pari passu basis. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and_
“—Indebtedness”.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the provisions described under “—Impairment
_of Security Interests” and “—Liens”, the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Shared Collateral in_
connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries,
including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any
such additional Security Interests that are in the future pledged to secure obligations under the Notes,
any Guarantee and the Indenture will also constitute “Collateral”.

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under
applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalisation rules, retention of title
claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defences
affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other
things, might limit the amount that can be secured by reference to the net assets and legal capital of
the Issuer and/or any relevant Guarantor. For a description of such contractual limitations, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”. In addition, and notwithstanding the provisions described below_
under “—Liens”, certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles.

As described above, the Shared Collateral will also secure, inter alia, the liabilities under the Revolving
Credit Facility, as well as certain Hedging Obligations, which will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Shared Collateral or certain distressed disposals in priority to the Notes and any
Guarantee, and may also secure certain future Indebtedness on the same basis with respect to the
receipt of proceeds from the enforcement of the Shared Collateral or certain distressed disposals in
priority to the Notes and any Guarantee. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Shared Collateral
after all such obligations have been satisfied may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to
the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to the
_extent of the value of the Collateral that will be granted as security for the Notes and future secured_
_indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes”._


-----

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Security Interests in the Shared Collateral among the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, secured
by the Shared Collateral, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders is or will be established by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the security
documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations, which provide,
among other things, that the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the
Guarantees, the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations will be secured equally and
ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Revolving Credit Facility”._

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide, among other things, that the obligations of the Issuer
under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Shared Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to the Notes and any
Guarantee. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In
addition, subject to certain limitations, the Shared Collateral may be pledged to secure future
Indebtedness, some of which may receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Shared Collateral
and certain distressed disposals in priority to the Notes and any Guarantee. See “—Release of Liens”,
“—Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”.

In addition, in connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture
to be secured on the Shared Collateral, the Issuer may enter into Additional Intercreditor Agreements
in compliance with the Indenture on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“—Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements; Agreement to be Bound”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Parent will grant security over the Collateral to
secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture.
The Security Documents will be entered into by, among others, the relevant security provider and the
Security Agent. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent or Trustee will act in
its own name but for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. With respect to the Shared Collateral,
the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future indebtedness that is
permitted to be secured on the Shared Collateral in relation to the Security Interests in favour of such
parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security
Interest in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee and the Indenture have
been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes may be released under
certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens”. The validity and enforceability of the
Security Interests will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or
collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favour under the Security Documents.
The Holders may only act through the Trustee, who will instruct the Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated
in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity
of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were to be successful, the Holders
may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. Please see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral”._


-----

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Parent will have the right to remain in possession
and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and
assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any
and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and noncash payments in respect of Capital Stock of
the Issuer).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility and counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations. These limitations are described
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to_
future Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to
have:

(1) consented and agreed to be bound by the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the
provisions described under “—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including, without limitation,
the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,
including upon an enforcement);

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to act on its behalf to enter into the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements” and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise_
their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith; and

(3) appointed and authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent to give effect to the provisions in the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be released under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security Interests in
respect of the Issuer Share Collateral) to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale
or other disposition does not violate, the provisions described under “—Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted_
Subsidiary, provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of
Capital Stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in connection with
a Qualified Receivables Financing) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or
otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favour of the Notes following such sale or disposal;
_provided that nothing in this clause (1) shall restrict the release of Security Interests in respect of_
the Issuer Share Collateral to the extent that, substantially concurrently with such release, Liens


-----

over the Issuer Share Collateral having equivalent ranking as prior to such release are granted for
the benefit of the Holders;

(2) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Notes Documents or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the
Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital
Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) as permitted by the provisions described under “—Impairment of Security Interests” or (other than
the Security Interest in respect of the Issuer Share Collateral) “—Merger and Consolidation”; and

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of
Collateral securing the Notes and any Guarantee, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the
consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. If requested to take action under this
provision, the Trustee and Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving
rise to a release of the Security has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with
respect to the release of security if required to implement such IPO Event), the Issuer shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Debt
Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the
“Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that:

(1) references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only
to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined below) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(2) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any
parent entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the
level of the IPO Pushdown Entity;

(3) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the
extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and _provided that_ nothing in this
paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (3) and any action
taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Issuer, shall, or shall be
deemed to, directly or indirectly, constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture, the Revolving Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the other collateral documents
or a Default or an Event of Default;

(4) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or events of default, as
applicable, in the Debt Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is
a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise);


-----

(5) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any parent entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly, constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant
or other term in the Debt Documents or a Default or an Event of Default;

(6) each parent entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released
from all obligations and restrictions under the Debt Documents and any security granted by any
such parent entity;

(7) each parent entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving
_pro forma effect thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany_
receivables) that are material to, or reasonably necessary for the operation of, the business of the
Group;

(8) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Subordinated Creditor”, “Third Party
Security Provider”, “Investor” or “Topco Independent Obligor” (as such terms are defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (each in such capacity, a “Released Person”) shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer, that Person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in the
applicable capacity as a Released Person and shall have no further rights or obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in that capacity); and
(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Released Person; and

(9) in the event that any Person is released from or ceases to be or become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Released Person as a consequence
of this paragraph, any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be a Released Person or that
any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to, release of, or replacement of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
security documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer
in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this section “IPO
_Debt Pushdown”; provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument will_
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party
thereto or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee,
the Security Agent or any other agents party thereto under the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or
Security Documents. The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each
irrevocably authorised and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any consent by the Holders
of the Notes) to execute any such amended, released or replacement documents and/or take other
such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request of the Issuer).

For the purpose of this section “IPO Debt Pushdown”, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or a parent entity of the Issuer notified to the Trustee by the Issuer
in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event;
_provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer which will issue_
shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a parent entity of such Restricted
Subsidiary).

If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this section
“IPO Debt Pushdown” in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the


-----

Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (a) the
provisions of clauses (1) to (7) of the first paragraph of this section “IPO Debt Pushdown” shall cease
to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (b) if any security has been released pursuant to the
foregoing paragraphs in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary will as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (c) if any Person party to the
Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of a Released Person has been released from the Intercreditor
Agreement pursuant to clauses (6) or (7) of the first paragraph or the third paragraph of this section
“IPO Debt Pushdown” in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably
practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as the applicable Released Person. For the
avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from
delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any
action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that
Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

of the original principal amount of the EUR Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional EUR

**General**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. If the Issuer
effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the
International Stock Exchange and the rules of the International Stock Exchange so require, inform the


-----

International Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In
addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided, however, that, in any case, such
redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given), or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

If a redemption date is not a Business Day or a Clearing System Business Day, payment may be made
on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and Clearing System Business Day, and no interest
shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on such redemption date if it
were a Business Day or Clearing System Business Day for the intervening period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (including any Change
of Control Offer (as defined below)), if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the
right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following
such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer,
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On ––––– 2027, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased
and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Notes for redemption will be selected in
accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (as applicable), unless otherwise
required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements; provided, however, that no
GBP Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only GBP
Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed and no EUR Note of €100,000 in aggregate
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only EUR Notes in integral multiples of €1,000
will be redeemed. The Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar will not be liable for any
selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If any GBP Notes or EUR Notes, as applicable, are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of
redemption that relates to such Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note.
In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease
the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the


-----

terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed
for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of
Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or a successor of the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time
upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (with a copy to
the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on
the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Board of Directors or
a member of Senior Management determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance, or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in position regarding the official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clause (1) and this clause (2),
a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any successor entity) with respect to any
Guarantee, as the case may be, is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts (but in the case of any Guarantor, only if such amount payable
cannot be paid using reasonable measures by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such
amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax
Law must not have been publicly announced before and must become effective on or after the date of
this Offering Memorandum (or, if the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction was not a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on the date of this Offering Memorandum, the date on which such Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture). Notice of redemption for
taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection
_and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than_
90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such
payment of Additional Amounts were a payment then due. Prior to the publication or mailing of any
notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an
Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor,
as the case may be, has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence
of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor or a successor of the Issuer or
Guarantor (a “Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the official interpretation or
administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:


-----

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on or with respect to any such Note or Guarantee
is made by or on behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, incorporated, engaged in business for tax
purposes or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and this
clause (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent
on or with respect to any Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts
(in the same form as the relevant payment) (the “Additional Amounts” which, for
purposes of calculating any Additional Amounts under the fourth paragraph of the provision described
under “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” only, shall include, any similar tax gross-up on any Pari
_Passu Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) as may be necessary in order that the_
net amounts of cash received by the Holder in respect of such payments after such withholding,
deduction or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts),
will not be less than the amounts of cash, which would have been received by the Holder in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) or beneficial owner of the
Note and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or
carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present
in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising merely
from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture or any Guarantee in respect
thereof;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable
notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or
identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or
satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition
to exemption from or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of all or part of such Tax
but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification
or documentation;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from any payment on or
with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee; or

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or
governmental charge.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Description of the Notes”, the Payor may withhold or
deduct any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are
substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations
thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with
respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof implementing such


-----

intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment
(where presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for
payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of
clauses (1) to (4) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide
such certified copies or, if such tax receipts are not available, such other reasonable evidence of such
payments, as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and each Paying Agent. Such copies shall
be made available to the Holders or beneficial owners upon request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes
evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal
amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per £1,000
principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on or with
respect to any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee and each Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which ease the
Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days
prior to the payment date). The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar Taxes, charges or levies
(including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) that arise in any
jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, any
Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer
of the Notes after the Offering) excluding any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders
and beneficial owners for any such Taxes paid by such Holders or beneficial owners.


-----

The foregoing obligations of this section “Withholding Taxes” will survive any termination, defeasance
or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor
to a Payor is organised, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise considered
to be a resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under
this heading “—Change of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase
all or any part (in integral multiples of £1,000 for GBP Notes and €1,000 for EUR Notes in excess
thereof; provided that GBP Notes of £100,000 or less or EUR Notes of €100,000 or less may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); _provided,_ _however,_ _that the Issuer shall not be_
obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, “—Change of Control”, in the event and
to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control (as defined
below), the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes,
with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is
not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or any portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;


-----

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to
and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail to each Holder of Definitive
Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
that is at least £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to the GBP
Notes, and €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to the EUR Notes.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require
the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter
a third-party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute
a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Notes as
described under this heading “—Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third-party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2)
a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as defined above under the caption
“—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption
price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change
of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant
to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of
Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events
that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the
Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and


-----

_the Collateral—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In_
_addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes_
_in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to specified other Persons.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above. In addition, if an event constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of
Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly permit a third-party to obtain control of the
Company in a transaction, which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to
make a Change of Control Offer.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Activities of the Issuer_**

The Issuer shall not trade, carry on any business, own any assets or incur any liabilities or grant any
lien except for a Permitted Holding Company Activity.

**_Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided,_ _however,_ _that the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor_
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after
giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) for the most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Issuer would have been no more than 3.9 to 1.0.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor (or, in the case of clauses (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (12), (14), (15) and (17) or otherwise as
specified below, any Restricted Subsidiary) of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted Debt”) shall not
be prohibited:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and, in each case, any guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed £150.0
million, plus (b) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause
(1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2)

(a) guarantees by the Issuer or, in the case of clause (15) below, any Restricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted to be Incurred by this “—Indebtedness” section
or any other provision of the Indenture; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed


-----

is subordinated to the Notes or a Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to
the Notes or such Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the provision described under “—Liens”, Indebtedness arising by reason of
any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided,_
_however, that:_

(a) if the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the
creditor is neither the Issuer nor a Subsidiary Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured
and, if the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor exceeds £20.0 million ((i) except in respect of intercompany current liabilities
Incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with the cash management
operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally
permitted (the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures
required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness)), expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in
cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable
Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(c) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer
not permitted by this clause (3);

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (not including any Additional Notes) and any related
Subsidiary Guarantees, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the
Revolving Credit Facility or described in clauses (3) and (4)(a) of this paragraph) outstanding on
the Issue Date, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described
in clauses (4)(a), (4)(b), this clause (4)(c) and clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this “—Indebtedness” section, and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (a) of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated,
amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and
assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred by the
Issuer or one or more Subsidiary Guarantors to provide all or a portion of the funds utilised to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition
or other transaction (x) the Issuer would have been able to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this “—Indebtedness” section after giving pro forma effect to the
relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5), or (y)
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and Incurrence of
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5);


-----

(6) Indebtedness Incurred under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity
Hedging Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalised Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase
Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the
purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a
Similar Business or (b) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or
cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or
equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of
assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which
refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of
£10.0 million and 8.0% of Consolidated EBITDA; so long as the Indebtedness exists on the date
of such purchase, lease, rental or improvement or is created within 365 days thereafter;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
unemployment insurance (including premiums related thereto), other types of social security,
pension obligations, vacation pay, health, disability or other employee benefits, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax (including
interest and penalties with respect thereto) or other guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities
or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental
requirement, provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other similar
instruments, the obligations are reimbursed within 30 Business Days following such drawing,
(c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business and (d) any customary
cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements, including customary
credit card facilities, in the ordinary course of business;

(9) Indebtedness arising from the Acquisition Agreement and Indebtedness arising from agreements
providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other
adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or
assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or
any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person
acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing
such acquisition or disposition); provided that, in connection with such disposition, the maximum
liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no
time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of non-cash proceeds (measured
at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually
received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honouring by a bank or other financial institution of a check,

Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed £25.0 million;

(12) Indebtedness Incurred in a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(13) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any

Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary)
of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares, a Parent Debt Contribution, an Excluded Contribution or the
Acquisition Equity Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the
issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, a Parent Debt Contribution, an
Excluded Contribution or the Acquisition Equity Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case,
subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (a) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are
so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under
the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of the provision
described below under “—Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer Incurs Indebtedness in
reliance thereon pursuant to this clause (13) and (b) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received
or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(13) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment

described below under “—Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;

(14) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities Incurred in connection with the Transactions or
any refinancing of Indebtedness (including by way of set off or exchange) so long such

(15) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which,
when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this
clause (15) and then outstanding (including any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or
refunds such Indebtedness), will not exceed £10.0 million;

(16) [Reserved]; and

(17) Indebtedness to the extent such Indebtedness at the time of Incurrence constitutes Tier 1 Capital
or Tier 2 Capital for purposes of calculating Applicable Capital Adequacy Requirements as
applicable to the Regulated Group; provided that such Indebtedness:

(a) is perpetual or has a final stated maturity after the Stated Maturity of the Notes and has no
rights of conversion prior to maturity (save where such rights of conversion are included in
the contractual terms of such Notes for the sole purpose of ensuring that such Notes comply
with requirements for Additional Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the applicable regulation);


-----

(b) after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof,
on the date thereof, either the Applicable Capital Adequacy Requirements of the Regulated
Group would be satisfied or any shortfall therefrom would be less than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof;

(c) the Issuer would have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph under “—Indebtedness”; and

(d) (i) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (17) and
then outstanding does not exceed the greater of £10.0 million and 8.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA and (ii) such amount in this clause (d)(i), when taken together with the aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness Incurred by the Regulated Group and then outstanding
under clause (15) of this “—Indebtedness” section, does not exceed the greater of £20.0
million and 16.0% of Consolidated EBITDA,

_provided further that none of the foregoing clauses (a) through (d) shall apply to the extent such_
Indebtedness is incurred in order for the Regulated Group to comply with applicable laws or in
performance of any undertaking given to, in response to, or in contemplation of, any request or
requirement from the Relevant Regulator that the Regulated Group complies with their Applicable
Capital Adequacy Requirements or otherwise issues and/or maintains additional Regulatory
Capital Resources and the Issuer reasonably determines that incurring indebtedness pursuant to
this basket is the most appropriate means of response to such applicable law, undertaking,
request or requirement.

Without prejudice to the section “—Financial Calculations”, for purposes of determining compliance
with the covenants described under this “—Indebtedness” section and, in each case, the
outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance
with this “—Indebtedness” section:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this “—Indebtedness” section, the Issuer, in its
sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and
only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if
applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this “—Indebtedness”
section;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall
be deemed initially Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this
“—Indebtedness” section and not the first paragraph or clauses (4)(b) or (4)(c) of the second
paragraph of this “—Indebtedness” section, and may not be reclassified;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this “—Indebtedness” section need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one


-----

such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this “—Indebtedness” section
permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under
any facility or enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness, the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating
any Applicable Metric for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the
Issuer’s option (A) on the date of such facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or
(B) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any
other Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (7) that the full
amount thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such
date) and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such
time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit
and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the
Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters
of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder);

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this
covenant or any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would
cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on
the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees),
including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; and

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS and shall
be the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this “—Indebtedness” section.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date
(and, if such Indebtedness is not exempted under the second paragraph of this “—Indebtedness”
section, such Incurrence shall constitute a default in respect of this covenant).

For purposes of determining the Issuer’s compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction
on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first
committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling Equivalent), in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that: (a) if such Indebtedness is_
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable pounds sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
pounds sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2)


-----

of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any
such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pounds
sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in pounds sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this “—Indebtedness” section, the maximum amount of
Indebtedness that the Issuer may Incur pursuant to the provisions described hereunder shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The
principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated
that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

**_Restricted Payments_**

any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the
Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock

Permitted Investment made pursuant to clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted
Investment”; and

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after
the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of_
the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included in the foregoing
clauses (iv), (v) or (vi).

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit or apply to, as the case may be, any of the following
(collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any Restricted Payment made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the

(B) 5.0% of the IPO Market Capitalisation provided that in the case of this clause (ii) after giving

(12) payments by the Issuer, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent to make
payments, to holders of Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares of such Capital Stock, provided, however, that any such payment, loan, advance,

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management acting in good faith.

For purposes of this “—Restricted Payments” section, in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (18)
above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this “—Restricted Payments” section, the
Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to divide or classify such Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) on the date made or later divide or reclassify such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this “—Restricted Payments” section.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or
any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial
**Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted**
Liens (as defined below) or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Subsidiary
Guarantor) are directly secured, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect
to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favour of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will
be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien to which it relates and (b) otherwise as set forth under “—Release of Liens”.


-----

**_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and it will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause
or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock, or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y)
the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or
advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Indenture and the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and
the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility) or (b) any other agreement or
instrument with respect to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in effect at or entered into on the Issue
Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with
an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2),
if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument
of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument (a) are no less favourable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management) or (b) are customary
in comparable financings and where, in the case of this sub-clause (b), the Issuer determines at
the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions would not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments
on the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management);


-----

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer
of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the

agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) [Reserved];

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions
described under “—Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to the Holders
than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, together with
the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as
in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management) or (B) the Issuer determines
at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments

**_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is
not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors or
a member of Senior Management); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such
Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since
the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet)
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obliged in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer
and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness
as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” section;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor received
from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that
such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
section that is at any one-time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £25.0 million and
20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated NonCash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this paragraph (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash
of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (8)
below) of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the provision described under “—Indebtedness” (or any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect thereof); _provided,_ _however,_ _that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or_
purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), such Indebtedness (other than the
Revolving Credit Facility) will be retired and the related commitment (if any) shall be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed;


-----

(ii) unless included in (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a senior or
_pari passu basis with the Notes at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such_
Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (x) any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor or (y) any Indebtedness of the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral; provided
_that, the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public_
Debt pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with the
provisions of this “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” section) an offer to Holders to
purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition
Offer (as defined below) for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that
(x) the total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount
outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(2) (i) purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price in cash equal to at
least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,
the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or (ii) redeem the Notes in accordance
with the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business,
if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4),
(5) or (6) of this paragraph (or any combination of the foregoing); _provided that a binding_
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date
of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment, if consummated,
and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the
investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the preceding paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds”. Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net
Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in
clause (8) above has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £25.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days
thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects,
to all holders of other outstanding _Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal_
amount of Notes and any Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount
equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each
case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date
of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing


-----

such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of GBP Notes (provided that GBP Notes of £100,000
or less may be redeemed in whole but not in part) and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of EUR Notes (provided that EUR Notes of
€100,000 or less may be redeemed in whole but not in part).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such _Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly_
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
other purpose, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other _Pari Passu_
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to
be repaid or repurchased on a _pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of_
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of
any such Indebtedness not denominated in pounds sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date selected
by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of
any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable
in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes
are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
**Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent**
it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this “—Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock” section (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”), or, if less than the Asset_
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and
_Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not_
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to the GBP Notes, and in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, with respect to the
EUR Notes. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this “—Sales
_of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” section. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will_
promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition
Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the
Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and
the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will
authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such
Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that
each such new GBP Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of £100,000 and
new EUR Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not


-----

so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant
to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of this “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” section, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Indenture, by virtue of any such compliance.

**_Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of £20.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £30.0 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved or ratified by the
majority of the Board of Directors resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the provisions described under
“—Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(iii) of the
second paragraph of the provision described under “—Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11), (14), (17)
and (19) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the
funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining
or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of
the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive
plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on
behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved or ratified by the Board of
Directors, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances or Parent Expenses and any waiver or transaction with respect
thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers,
consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent
(whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of
such directors, officers or employees);


-----

(6) (a) the Transactions; (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of
or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this “—Affiliate Transactions” section or to the extent not more disadvantageous
to the Holders in any material respect; and (c) the entry into and performance of any registration
rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement or
payment pursuant to which the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is
required or permitted to file a consolidated or combined tax return, or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest
in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; _provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of_
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved or ratified by a majority of the members
of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination; and (b) any amendment, waiver or

other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, as applicable;

and (b) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing,

divestitures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this
clause (11)(b) are approved or ratified by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) any transactions for which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter from
an Independent Financial Adviser stating that such transaction is (a) fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (b) that the terms are not materially less
favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at
such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate;

(13) investments by any of the Permitted Holders in securities of any of the Issuer’s Restricted
Subsidiaries (and the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Permitted Holders in
connection therewith) so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the preceding
paragraph, (ii) the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or more

favourable terms and (iii) the investment constitutes less than 5.0% of the proposed issue amount
of such class of securities;

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

**Reports**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended 31 December 2021, annual

been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); _provided that such_
_pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the
most recent fiscal year with comparative balance sheet information as at the end of the prior fiscal

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction (other than the Acquisition)


-----

that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior
executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report
containing a description of such event.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to
prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable
under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act. The Issuer shall
also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished to
the Trustee on the Issuer’s website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information;
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a_
change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the
results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering
Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were
restricted) constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the first paragraph of this “—Reports” covenant will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from
the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.
Subject to compliance with the penultimate paragraph of this covenant, in the event that the Issuer or
any Parent or IPO Entity becomes subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to
issuers of securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the
equivalent standards applicable to issuers of securities admitted to trading on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Madrid Stock Exchange, Milan Stock Exchange, Irish Stock
Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to
the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would
be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such admission and disclosure
standards (or the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Madrid Stock Exchange,
Milan Stock Exchange, Irish Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange equivalent, as
applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, and _provided that such requirements_
require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the London Stock Exchange, Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, Madrid Stock Exchange, Milan Stock Exchange, Irish Stock Exchange or
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long
as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section


-----

13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements of the Issuer
under this covenant by providing any financial statements or reports of a direct or indirect Parent of the
Issuer, in which case references to the Issuer in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph hereof
will be deemed to be references to such Parent; _provided that, to the extent the comparable prior_
period consolidated or condensed financial information of such Parent does not exist, the comparable
prior period consolidated or combined financial information of the Issuer may be provided in lieu
thereof; _provided further that such report or financial statements shall include a reasonably detailed_
description of the financial condition and results of operations of such Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries. Furthermore, to the extent that financial information for the Issuer or any Parent
is not available for a comparable period ending prior to the Issue Date, the comparable prior period
consolidated or combined information of the Target may be provided in lieu thereof.

Delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee pursuant to this section will be for
informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s receipt thereof shall not constitute actual or constructive
notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein,
including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or documents related
thereto.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organised and existing under the laws of the United
Kingdom, any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America, any State
of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and
(b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at
the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing;

(3) on the date of such transaction after giving _pro forma effect thereto and any related financing_
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter period,
either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an
additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the provision described under
“—Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would not be less
than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorised,
executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the


-----

Successor Company under the supplemental indenture (in each case, reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee), _provided that, in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s_
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result
of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with, the
provisions described under “—Indebtedness”.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets,
the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
“—Merger and Consolidation” section) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset
Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the provisions described under “—Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer._

**_Subsidiary Guarantors_**

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is
the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as
an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to
any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or
becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Subsidiary Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor
under its Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of that
Subsidiary Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the
transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this provision shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or


-----

regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders
of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors
or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” section shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the
Issuer, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor;
(ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties
and assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer
into any Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or
consolidation, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, if any, to which it is a party, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The
_Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor consolidating_
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing
the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The
_Issuer” and clause (3) (other than clause (3)(B)(2)) under the heading “—Subsidiary Guarantors” shall_
apply to any such transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interests_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral), and the Issuer will not, and it will not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Trustee or the Security Agent (for the
benefit of the Trustee, the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), any interest whatsoever in any
of the Collateral, except that the following shall be permitted, to the extent undertaken by the Issuer
and any Restricted Subsidiary:

(1) the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens;

(2) the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable
Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) any amendment of the applicable Security Documents from time to time (i) to cure any ambiguity,
mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein, (ii) to comply with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) to add Collateral, (iv) to
evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor and the
assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the
provisions described under “—Merger and Consolidation”, (v) to evidence and provide for the
acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent or (vi) in any manner that
does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; and

(4) subject to the following proviso, any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release or other modification or replacement to any Security Documents for the purposes of
undertaking a Permitted Reorganisation,


-----

_provided,_ _however,_ _that, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the_
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of
Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, clause (3)
above), the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless, contemporaneously with any such action, the
Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion from an Independent Financial Adviser
confirming the solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (ii) a certificate from an officer of the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this “—Impairment of Security Interests” section, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have
Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarised
under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: “—Indebtedness”, “—Restricted Payments”,
“—Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”, “—Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock”, “—Affiliate Transactions”, “—Future Guarantees”, the provisions of clause (3) of the first_
paragraph under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” and the second, third and fourth
paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” and, in each case, any related default
provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer. Such
provisions and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day
on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such provisions will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (respectively) properly taken during
the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The provisions described under “—Restricted Payments” will
be interpreted as if they have been in effect since the Issue Date but not during the continuance of the
Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified
as permitted under clause (4)(b) or (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the provision described under
“—Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take
actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as
long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in
anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve
Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee in writing that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such
notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the covenants to be effective.


-----

**_Future Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, it shall constitute a default in respect of the
Issuer for any Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Subsidiary
Guarantor outstanding under any Credit Facility that is Incurred pursuant to (i) the first paragraph or
clauses (1) and (5)(b) of the second paragraph of the provision described under “—Indebtedness” or
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, (ii) clause (13) of the second paragraph of the
provision described under “—Indebtedness”, or (iii) that is Public Debt, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor on the date on which such guarantee is Incurred
and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the
form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee;
_provided, however, that no such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant_
to the preceding sentence to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Subsidiary Guarantee
is contrary to Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect
to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee
may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain
defences generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases
_of Guarantees”. A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if_
at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture
if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been
Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not
designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all
requested actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, necessary to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall,
at the option of the Company, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any
Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable
Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; _provided that_ the
_pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any_
Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph,
such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes;
_provided that: (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the_
basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall


-----

thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics;
and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be
determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been
complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric),
such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied
with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or
Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable
Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied
(including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements
and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

Subject to clause (7) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—
_Indebtedness”, in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action_
or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and
prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer
determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such
Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is
committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in
reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be
calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank
guarantee facility and/or other debt, which is available to be re-drawn (including under a Revolving
Credit Facility or any ancillary facility under the Revolving Facility Agreement) and, for the avoidance
of doubt, subject to paragraph (7) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain
_Covenants—Indebtedness” any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving_
Credit Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

For purposes of determining compliance with any: (A) sterling-denominated Applicable Metric, the
Sterling Equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of
exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into by the
Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in paragraph (C) below); or (B)
any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio
under the Notes Documents), the sterling-equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, using any of: (i) any applicable weighted average spot
conversion rates over the relevant testing period; (ii) any applicable conversion rates used in any
relevant financial statements or management accounts; or (iii) any applicable conversion rate selected
by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the
Applicable Test Date, if applicable); or (iv) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange
hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group, and, in each case, no Default, Event
of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of
a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in
exchange rates.

Without prejudice to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer may, from time to time, by notice
to the Trustee, redenominate any Applicable Metric denominated in a particular currency into pounds
sterling by reference to any rate referred to in clause (B) of the immediately preceding paragraph and,


-----

on and from the date of such notice, such Applicable Metric shall for all purposes be construed as
being denominated in such currency specified by the Issuer in the amount determined by the Issuer
in accordance with this paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this
“Description of the Notes”), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or
component thereof, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (A) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or
other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from (i) the
Transactions, (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the Indenture or
the impact from purchase price accounting, (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or
re-branding of existing businesses, (iv) research and development expenditure (and the capitalisation
thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS; and/or (B) include any addbacks (without further
verification or diligence) for adjustments or costs or expenses (i) of a type reflected in this Offering
Memorandum and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to an Investment or
acquisition permitted under the Indenture prepared by an independent third-party and/or (ii) taken into
account in determining Consolidated EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for an
Investment or acquisition permitted under the Indenture.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
**permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower**
permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a
result of an acquisition or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission
shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time
to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced
as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Indebtedness”, if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a
portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would
subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer,
such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to
such ratio-based permission. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a
calendar year, a Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar
annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(1) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference
(if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the
amount thereof actually used or applied by the Issuer during such preceding Annual Period
(the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in
the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following
Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(2) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (1) above, any usage of such Applicable
Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first,
against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted
during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (1) above; and
(C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness
(or their duly authorised Representatives) an intercreditor agreement or a restatement, amendment or
other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”)


-----

on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favourable
to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Guarantees and priority and release of Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion
of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement, it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be
on substantially similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect
the rights of the Holders and will be permitted by this provision if, in each case, the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness (and any Lien in its favour) in respect of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, is permitted
by the provisions described under “—Indebtedness” and “—Liens”.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantees); (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes; (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens;
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof; or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect
the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”,
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent
or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall
consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided,
_however,_ _that such transaction would comply with the provisions described under “—Restricted_
_Payments”._

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day
upon prior written request at the Issuer’s offices, or the offices of the Trustee.

**_Permitted Transactions_**

Notwithstanding anything under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” to the contrary,
the Indenture will not restrict or in any manner limit the ability of the Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiaries to effect the Transactions and any related transactions or actions in connection thereto.


-----

**_Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment and Applicable Transactions_**

In connection with the calculation of availability under any ratio or basket under the Indenture in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires that no Default
or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as
applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default
or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreements for such Limited
Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction are entered into after giving
_pro forma effect to the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable_
Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has exercised its option under the first sentence
of this paragraph, and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive
agreements for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable
Transaction were entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition,
Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed not to have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being
taken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable
Transaction is permitted hereunder.

In connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable
Transaction for the purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of a
ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in the Indenture,

in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection
with any Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction, an “LCA
**Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder may be**
deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable
Repayment or Applicable Transaction are entered into (the “LCA Test Date”). If, after giving pro forma
effect to the Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction and the
other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCA Test Date for which internal financial
statements of the Issuer are available, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCA Test
Date in compliance with such ratio or basket.

If the Issuer has made an LCA Election, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio
or basket availability with respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of Restricted
Payments or Investments or the making of Asset Dispositions, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or the designation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable Transaction is consummated or
the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is terminated
or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or
Applicable Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming
such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and other transactions in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been
consummated. If the Issuer has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which
compliance was determined or tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the
Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment or Applicable
Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or
ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest (including if required by the terms of the Indenture to be paid
in cash) on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, which continues for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least
30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its agreements contained in the Indenture
(other than a default in performance or breach of a covenant or agreement which is specifically
dealt with in clauses (1) or (2) above);

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £30.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of £30.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for
a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than (i) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture or (ii) caused
by the action or inaction of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of £20.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents or any Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and


-----

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture notify the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders) of
the Default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, subject to its rights and protections under the Indenture,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and
unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred
and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise
to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of
Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the applicable Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, which shall require the consent of each Holder affected
thereby unless Holders of not less than 90% in then outstanding principal amount waive such Default
or Event of Default) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due,
no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which
a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a
prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking
any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security (or payment
in advance) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or
not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is
continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice
of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines
that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to
the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware
which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes
to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity
or security to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes). Without the consent of Holders holding not less than
90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (10), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes


-----

then outstanding (or, alternatively, the consent of each Holder affected thereby), an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of
and interest on or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the Security Interest granted for the benefit of the Trustee or the
Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of such Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all Guarantors from any of their obligations under their respective
Guarantees or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any amendment or waiver with respect to
any matter described in clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (9) in the preceding paragraph that by its
terms applies to only the GBP Notes or the EUR Notes shall require the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the GBP Notes or the EUR Notes, as
applicable, in order for it to be binding on all holders of such series of Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any
Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Trustee or the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;


-----

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security
Agent or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee, the
Security Agent or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the provisions
described under the “—Indebtedness” or “—Future Guarantees” sections, to add Guarantees with
respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence
the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral
and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of
_the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Guarantee,_
the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or
Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee
or the Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Lien in favour
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee, the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit
Facility, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit
Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
Lien is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Lien in
the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided that the granting of such Lien is not_
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the provisions described under “—Impairment of Security Interests” are complied
with; or

(10) as provided in “—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” or “—Impairment of Security Interests”.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely
on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid
by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in
any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor under the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,


-----

except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the Security Agent and the obligations of
the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer
exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of the provision described
under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default
provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of
the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions
(other than with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default” above
(“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of the provision described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries),_
(6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose),
with respect to the GBP Notes, money in pounds sterling or pounds sterling-denominated UK
Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and, with
respect to the EUR Notes, cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof in an amount sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and, in each case, must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognise income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to
be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when: (1) either (a) all such Notes
previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation or (b) all such Notes
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), with respect to the GBP Notes, money or pounds
sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, or, with
respect to the EUR Notes, cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or
caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of such Notes at Stated
Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under
the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and
(4)). If requested by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders
prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or
any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event
of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under
the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own
affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realise on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders


-----

of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has actual knowledge that it has
acquired a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or
becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been
a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
expenses incurred without gross negligence, wilful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered by
or on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made. Any notice or
communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent
means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect
to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. Notices given by mail will be deemed given five calendar days
after mailing.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Issuer and any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after
the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

British pounds sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer
and any Guarantor under or in connection with the GBP Notes or the relevant Guarantees, if any,
including damages, and euros is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by
the Issuer and any Guarantor under or in connection with the EUR Notes or the relevant Guarantees,
if any, including damages (each, a “Required Currency”). Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than sterling, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent
of the Required Currency amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Required Currency amount is less than the sterling amount expressed to be due to the recipient
or the Trustee under any Note, Guarantee or the Indenture (as applicable), the Issuer and each
Guarantor will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result.
In any event, the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note
or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of


-----

information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a
separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and such Guarantor’s other obligations, will
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted
by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will
continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-pounds sterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such non-pounds sterling amount is Incurred, in the case of term
Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling Equivalent) or
made, as the case may be.

in the United States will appoint Law Debenture Corporate Services Inc., as their agent for service of
process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and Guarantees
brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement,
extinguishment, amendment, repricing, replacement, exchange or other discharge of Indebtedness,
and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable

_pro forma calculations shall be as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial_
officer of the Issuer (and may include anticipated expense and cost reduction and synergies),
including, without limitation, as a result of, or that would result from any actions taken, committed to

day of such period;

(3) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been
a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(4) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(5) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest
expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date
had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation
applicable to such Indebtedness).

_pro forma and other adjustments as are consistent with the_ _pro forma provisions set forth in the_
definition of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall
not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions

above.

“Contingent Obligations” means, with respect to any Person, any obligation of such Person

pursuant to any security, instrument or agreement other than Capital Stock, in each case issued to and
held by any of the foregoing Persons, together with any such security, instrument or agreement and
any other security or instrument other than Capital Stock issued in payment of any obligation under

sinking fund payment prior to the first anniversary of the Stated Maturity of the Notes (other than
through conversion or exchange of such funding into Capital Stock (other than Disqualified

or any of its Subsidiaries; and

(5) pursuant to its terms or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or another intercreditor agreement, is fully subordinated and junior in right of payment
to the Notes pursuant to subordination, payment blockage and enforcement limitation terms

###### BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM

**General**

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes representing the Notes (the
“Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The
Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes may only be traded in denominations of £100,000 and
in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to
own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of
interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical
delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable (or its nominees) will be considered the Holder for all purposes under the Indenture. As
such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of Holders
under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes (as defined below):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or


-----

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue
or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in
denominations of £100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and
the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require
a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed
pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is
replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions
of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer
Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption


-----

of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational procedures;
provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less £100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less,
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream,
which will distribute such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream which will distribute them to their
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the
Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
subscribers registered in “street name”.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents
will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection
with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic
and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in euro.


-----

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a Holder only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their
respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must
transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors”.

After the expiration of the 40-day period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only
upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144
under the Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors”, Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”.
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective
agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations, they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pounds sterling and euros. Book-Entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement
date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisers as to the tax_
_consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of_
_interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, Jersey, the United Kingdom or United_
_States law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such_
_law that may take effect after such date. References in this section to Holders include the beneficial_
_owners of the Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to Jersey, the United Kingdom and_
_United States tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section._
_The statements regarding Jersey, the United Kingdom and United States laws and practices set forth_
_below assume that the Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with_
_the Indenture._

**Certain Jersey Tax Considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Issuer and Holders (other than residents of
Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this
document and is subject to changes in such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or
tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice (including such tax law and
practice as they apply to any land or building situated in Jersey). Prospective investors in the Notes
should consult their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise
disposing of the Notes under the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

**_Taxation of the Issuer_**

The Issuer is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey because it is centrally managed and
controlled and resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction outside Jersey where the highest rate at which
any company may be charged to tax on any part of its income is 10% or higher (the “Management
**and Control Condition”). Consequently, the Issuer will not be liable to Jersey income tax other than**
on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the
Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended (the “1961 Law”)) and payments in respect of the Notes
may be paid by the Issuer without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax.
However, if the Issuer ceases to satisfy the Management and Control Condition, it will be regarded as
resident for tax purposes in Jersey and on the basis that the Issuer is neither a financial services
company nor a utility company for the purposes of the 1961 Law, that it is neither in the trade of
importing into Jersey or supplying in Jersey hydrocarbon oil and that it is not a large corporate retailer
for purposes of the 1961 Law, the Issuer would be subject to income tax in Jersey at a rate of 0%.

Holders (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the
holding, sale or other disposition of such Notes.

**_GST_**

Jersey charges a tax on goods and services supplied in Jersey (“GST”). On the basis that the Issuer
has obtained international services entity status, GST is not chargeable on supplies of goods and/or
services made by the Issuer. The directors intend to conduct the business of the Issuer such that no
GST will be incurred by the Issuer.

**_Stamp Duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Notes except that stamp duty is
payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to


-----

transfer the Notes on the death of a Holder where such Notes are situated in Jersey. In the case of a
grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of the estate
(wherever situated in respect of a holder of the Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey in
respect of a holder of the Notes domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate
of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000. Where the Notes are in registered
form and the register is not maintained in Jersey, such Notes should not be considered to be situated
in Jersey for tax purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there
other estate duties.

If you are in any doubt as to your tax position you should consult your professional tax adviser.

**Certain UK Taxation Considerations**

The following is a summary of the UK withholding taxation treatment and stamp duty and stamp duty
reserve tax treatment at the date hereof in relation to payments of principal and interest in respect of
the Notes. It is based on current law and the practice of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”)
(which may not be binding on HMRC), which may be subject to change, sometimes with retrospective
effect. The comments do not deal with other UK tax aspects of acquiring, holding or disposing of the
Notes. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the
Notes. The following is a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with
appropriate caution. It is not intended as tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the tax
considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser. Noteholders who are in any doubt as
to their tax position should consult their professional advisers. Noteholders who may be liable to
taxation in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or
disposal of the Notes are particularly advised to consult their professional advisers as to whether they
are so liable (and if so under the laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only
to certain UK taxation aspects of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, noteholders should
be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments
in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or
on account of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom.

**_Payment of Interest_**

Interest which has a UK source (“UK interest”) may be paid by the Issuer without withholding or
deduction for or on account of UK income tax if the Notes in respect of which the UK interest is paid
constitute “quoted Eurobonds”. The Notes will constitute quoted Eurobonds provided they are and
continue to be listed on a recognised stock exchange (within the meaning of section 1005 of the
Income Tax Act 2007 (the “Act”) for the purposes of section 987 of the Act) or admitted to trading on
a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a regulated recognised stock exchange (within the meaning
of section 987 of the Act). Securities will be “listed on a recognised stock exchange” for this purpose
if they are admitted to trading on an exchange designated as a recognised stock exchange by an order
made by the Commissioners for HMRC and either they are included in the UK official list (within the
meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or they are officially listed, in
accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in European Economic Area
states, in a country outside the United Kingdom in which there is a recognised stock exchange. The
Exchange (formerly known as the Channel Islands Securities Exchange) is such a recognised stock
exchange. The Issuer’s understanding of current HMRC practice is that securities which are admitted
to trading on that Exchange may be regarded as “listed on a recognised stock exchange” for these
purposes.

In all other cases, UK interest on the notes may fall to be paid under the UK income tax at the basic
rate, currently 20%, subject to such relief as may be available following a direction from HMRC
pursuant to any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.


-----

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If any Guarantor were to make a payment in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due
under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) such payments may
be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to such relief as may be
available under an applicable double tax treaty (a “Treaty”), or to any other exemption which may
apply. Where such a Treaty relief is available, and the applicable conditions in the relevant Treaty are
satisfied, the Noteholder should be entitled to a refund of tax withheld, provided it complies with the
applicable formalities relating to such claim within the relevant limitation period. It may, however, not in
practice be possible for the Noteholder to obtain a direction for the guarantee payments to be made
free from withholding tax.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)_**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT should be payable on the issue of the Notes or on a transfer of the Notes.

**Other Considerations Relating to Taxation**

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax_**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s
**Proposal”) for a directive for a common financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) in Belgium, Germany,**
Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia (the “participating Member States”)
and Estonia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings
in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the
Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a
participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be “established” in
a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a
person established in a participating Member State, or (b) where the financial instrument which is
subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional
Member States of the European Union may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
FTT.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following summary discusses certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. Except as specifically noted below, this discussion applies
only to Notes purchased on original issuance at the issue price on the cover of this Offering
Memorandum, which are held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally,
property held for investment) by U.S. Holders (as defined below).

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of a U.S.
Holder’s particular circumstances or to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:

- financial institutions;

- insurance companies;

- dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

- regulated investment companies;


-----

- real estate investment trusts;

- tax exempt organisations;

- persons holding Notes as part of a hedging transaction, “straddle”, conversion transaction or
other integrated transaction;

- certain former citizens and residents of the United States;

- U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons liable for alternative minimum tax;

- persons required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to accelerate the recognition of any item
of gross income with respect to the Notes on as a result of such income being recognised on an
applicable financial statement; or

- entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
invests in Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status
of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships considering an investment in the
Notes should consult their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of their investment.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended to the date hereof (the
“Code”), administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed U.S.
Treasury Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this Offering Memorandum
may affect the tax consequences described below, possibly on a retroactive basis. No ruling will be
sought from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to any statement in this discussion
and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge such statements, or, if challenged, that
a court will uphold such statements.

This discussion does not address any other U.S. federal income tax laws (such as the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income). Persons considering the purchase of the Notes should
consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their
particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or nonU.S. taxing jurisdiction.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

- a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or
the District of Columbia;

- an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including additional amounts paid in respect of non-U.S.
withholding taxes and without reduction for non-U.S. tax withheld, if any) generally will be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as foreign-source ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued,
in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include, in ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the British pound sterling or the euro
(as applicable) (the “Reference Currency”) interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange
on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realise exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest


-----

income, but it may recognise exchange gain or loss upon the actual disposition of the Reference
Currency received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in the Reference
Currency that has accrued during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will
be determined by translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the
partial period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued interest income using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last
day of the portion of the accrual period within the U.S. Holder’s taxable year. If the last day of an accrual
period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may
translate such interest at the spot rate on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other
obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S.
Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise
exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received.
The amount of exchange gain or loss recognised will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the Reference Currency payment received (translated at the spot rate on the date such
payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that
has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is
in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss will generally constitute U.S. source ordinary income
or loss.

If the issue price of the Notes is less than their principal amount by more than a de minimis amount,
U.S. Holders will be subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules with respect to this original issue
discount (“OID”). OID will be considered to be de minimis if it is less than .25% of the principal amount
multiplied by the number of complete years to stated maturity. U.S. Holders will be required to include
any OID in income for U.S. federal tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with a constant yield
method based on a compounding of interest, even though the cash attributable to this income will not
be received until the Notes are sold, exchanged or retired. OID on the Notes generally would be
accrued in the Reference Currency in a manner similar to accruals of interest by accrual method
taxpayers discussed above. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers concerning how to
account for any OID that may accrue on the Notes.

U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how to account for payments made or
received in the Reference Currency.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of the Notes in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar
amount realised on such disposition (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted basis in the Notes. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted basis in a Note will be
determined by reference to the U.S. dollar cost of the Note and increased for any accruals of OID.

A U.S. Holder will recognise U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on
the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of the Note equal to the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note in Reference Currency measured
on (i) the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date
on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. Any such exchange gain or loss will be realised only to
the extent of total gain or loss realised on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid
interest). Any additional gain or loss realised on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if, at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, the


-----

Notes have been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognised by a non-corporate
holder generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income. The
deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. Holders should consult their tax own advisers regarding how to account for payments made or
received in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

If there is an IPO Pushdown, the Notes could be treated as being exchanged for new Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are treated as being exchanged in this manner, the deemed
exchange would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. Furthermore, the “new”
Notes could be deemed to be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In that event, U.S. holders would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as
it accrues, regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential impact to them of an IPO Pushdown
in their particular circumstances.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of principal and interest in
respect of, and the proceeds from sales, redemption or other disposition of, Notes held by a U.S.
Holder unless the U.S. Holder establishes, if required, that it is exempt from the information reporting
rules, for example, by properly establishing that it is a corporation. If the U.S. Holder does not establish
that it is exempt from these rules, the U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding on these
payments if it fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup
withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and the amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their advisers regarding any
additional tax reporting or filing requirements they may have as a result of the acquisition, ownership
or disposition of the Notes, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial
assets or foreign currency losses. Failure to comply with certain reporting obligations could result in
the imposition of substantial penalties.

###### CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

**Overview**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes
requirements on “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that are subject
to Title I of ERISA, such as pension plans, retirement plans, profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, health
and welfare plans, medical plans, certain voluntary employee’s beneficiary associations and certain
look-through entities, such as tax-exempt group trusts, common or collective trust funds of banks,
collective investment funds, and insurance company separate accounts whose underlying assets
include the assets of such employee benefit plans, certain insurance company general accounts,
separately managed accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such employee benefit
plans and other funds and investment vehicles that are treated as holding plan assets because of
plans’ investment in the entities (each, an “ERISA Plan”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries
with respect to ERISA Plans. ERISA also imposes limits on transactions between ERISA Plans and the
ERISA Plan’s service providers or other related parties.

Each fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider ERISA and the regulations and guidance thereunder
when considering an investment in the Notes. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans, as well as other “plans” and
other retirement arrangements within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that are subject
to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts or “Keogh” plans (together with
an ERISA Plan, a “Plan”), should also consider, among other items, the issues described below when
considering an investment in the Notes.

**Fiduciary Duty of Investing ERISA Plans**

When evaluating the prudence of an investment, the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary should consider the U.S.
Department of Labor (the “DOL”) regulation on investment duties. Under ERISA, a person who
exercises discretionary authority or control regarding the management or disposition of an ERISA
Plan’s assets is generally considered a fiduciary of such an ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans
are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, which should be considered with regards to
each ERISA Plan’s particular facts and circumstances. For example, when considering an investment
in the Notes with an ERISA Plan’s assets, the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary would typically determine,
particularly in light of the risks and limited liquidity inherent in an investment in the Notes, whether the
investment in the Notes would (i) satisfy the diversification requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(C) of
ERISA, (ii) be in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan pursuant
to Section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA and (iii) be prudent with respect to the structure and nature of the
Offering.

In addition, ERISA requires an ERISA Plan’s fiduciary to maintain indicia of ownership for the ERISA
Plan’s assets within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Courts. While it is not intended that the
Issuer’s underlying assets will be “plan assets”, there can be no assurance that, notwithstanding the
Issuer’s commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer’s underlying assets will not otherwise be deemed
to include “plan assets” for the purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In any event,
the Issuer is not accepting any appointment, conditional or otherwise, as a fiduciary to an investing
ERISA Plan. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should also consider ERISA’s rules relating to delegation of
control.

ERISA Plans investing in the Notes may be required to report compensation, including indirect
compensation, paid in connection with the ERISA Plan’s investment on Schedule C of Form 5500
(Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan). The descriptions in this Offering Memorandum of
services provided to stockholders, management fees, incentive fees, ancillary fees, direct fees, other
fees and direct compensation paid by stockholders and any indirect compensation and commissions
earned by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers in respect of an investment in the Notes, including the
fees paid to the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and the payor, are intended to satisfy the disclosure
requirement for “eligible indirect compensation”, for which an alternative reporting procedure on
Schedule C of Form 5500 may be available.


-----

Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should consider whether an investment in the Notes might constitute or
give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

**Prohibited Transactions**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets
of a Plan and persons and their affiliates that have certain relationships to the Plan, including the Plan’s
fiduciaries and other service providers (referred to as “parties in interest” under Section 3(14) of ERISA
and “disqualified persons” under Section 4975 of the Code, and each, a “Party in Interest”).
Regardless of whether our underlying assets are deemed to include the assets of a Plan, an investment
in the Notes by a Plan, with respect to which any of the Issuer, Cinven, the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates (each, a “Transaction Party”) is considered a Party in Interest may constitute or
result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction.

The Transaction Parties may be Parties in Interest with respect to many Plans, and if an acquisition,
holding or disposition of the Notes were determined to be a prohibited transaction between a Plan and
a Party in Interest, a statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption would be required.
Included among the exemptions are the statutory exemption of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to certain transactions between a Plan and a service provider
to the Plan, provided that neither the service provider nor its affiliate has or exercises any discretionary
authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in
the transaction (in other words, not a fiduciary) and provided further that the Plan pays no more than,
and receives no less than, “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction) and the
administrative exemptions of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to
investments made by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected
by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions
involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance
company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by certain
“in-house asset managers”). Each fiduciary of a Plan should consider in an investment in the Notes,
among other things, whether such an investment would involve (i) a direct or indirect extension of
credit to a Party in Interest, (ii) a sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a Party in Interest
or (iii) a transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a Party in Interest of the Plan’s assets. In this regard,
there can be no assurance that any of these or other exemptions will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving an investment in the Notes.

The investment class exemptions described above cover per se prohibited transactions between Plans
and Parties in Interest. Most of the exemptions do not provide relief from some or all of the self-dealing
prohibitions under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and Plan fiduciaries should
consider whether any of the self-dealing prohibitions could be relevant here.

Each fiduciary of a Plan that has engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be required to,
among other potential actions, (i) restore to the Plan any profit realised on the transaction, (ii)
reimburse the Plan for any losses suffered by the Plan as a result of the transaction or (iii) unwind the
transaction. Under Section 4975 of the Code, a Party in Interest may be required to pay excise taxes
based on the amount involved in the transaction (including a 100% excise tax if the transaction is not
corrected within a certain time period).

**The ERISA Plan Asset Regulation**

Under the DOL regulation at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the
“ERISA Plan Asset Regulation”), when a Plan invests in an “equity interest” of an entity (which is
defined as an interest other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local
law and which has no substantial equity features) that is neither a publicly offered security nor a
security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, the Plan’s
assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying


-----

assets unless an exception to this general rule applies, including if it is established that the entity is an
“operating company” or that equity participation in such entity by “Benefit Plan Investors” is not
“significant”.

An “operating company” is defined under the ERISA Plan Asset Regulation as an entity that is primarily
engaged, directly or through a majority owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in the production or sale of
a product or service other than the investment of capital. A “Benefit Plan Investor” means a Plan.
Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in an entity is “significant” under the ERISA Plan Asset
Regulation if, immediately after the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or
more of the value of any class of equity interests in the entity is held by Benefit Plan Investors,
excluding for the purposes of this calculation the value of equity interests held by (i) persons, other
than Benefit Plan Investors, that have discretionary authority or control over the assets of the entity, or
that provide investment advice with respect to such assets for a fee, directly or indirectly, or
(ii) “affiliates” of the foregoing clause (i) persons (with respect to the Issuer’s assets, a “Controlling
**Person”). For these purposes, an “affiliate” of a person, as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of the ERISA**
Plan Asset Regulation, includes any person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries,
“controlling”, “controlled” by, or under common “control” with the person, and “control”, with respect
to a person other than an individual, means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the
management or policies of such person. It must be true immediately after each acquisition, transfer or
disposition of the Notes that less than 25% of the value of any class of equity interests in us is held by
Benefit Plan Investors (excluding any holdings by Controlling Persons) in order for our assets to not
be treated as “plan assets”.

In the event the Notes are treated as equity for purposes of the ERISA Plan Asset Regulation, this could
result, among other things, in the application of the prudence and other fiduciary standards of ERISA
to investments made by the Issuer and the possibility that certain transactions involving the Issuer
could be deemed to constitute direct or indirect prohibited transactions, to the extent such transactions
involved a Party in Interest with respect to a Plan which acquires or holds Notes. The Issuer will not be
an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, and there can be no
assurance that Benefit Plan Investors will hold less than 25% of the total value of each class of the
Notes, excluding holdings by Controlling Persons, at the completion of this Offering or thereafter, and
no monitoring or other measures will be undertaken with respect to the level of such ownership with
respect to any class of the Notes.

Each prospective investor should make its own assessment as to whether or not the Notes will be
respected as indebtedness for purposes of the ERISA Plan Asset Regulation and should consult with
its own legal advisers concerning the potential consequences under the fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any applicable
Similar Law (defined below) of an investment in the Notes with the assets of a Plan or a plan that is
subject to any Similar Law (defined below).

**Similar Law Plans**

“Governmental plans” within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA, “church plans” within the
meaning of Section 3(33) of ERISA that have made no election under Section 410(d) of the Code and
non-U.S. plans described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
and prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may
nevertheless be subject to a U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that contains one or
more provisions that are similar to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”).

**Representations and Warranties**

Each prospective investor in the Notes will be deemed to have represented that (a) it is or it is not a
Benefit Plan Investor or a Controlling Person and (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the
Notes will not result in or constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Law.


-----

Each prospective investor in the Notes that is a Benefit Plan Investor will be deemed to have
represented and warranted by its investment that (x) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any
investment recommendation or investment advice to the Benefit Plan Investor, or any fiduciary or other
person investing on behalf of the Benefit Plan Investor or who otherwise has discretion or control over
the investment and management of “plan assets” (“Plan Fiduciary”), on which either the Benefit Plan
Investor or Plan Fiduciary has relied in connection with the decision for an investment in the Notes,
(y) the Transaction Parties are not otherwise acting as a “fiduciary”, as that term is defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the Benefit Plan Investor or Plan Fiduciary
in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in the Notes and (z) the Plan Fiduciary is
exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the transaction.

Any purported transfer of the Notes in violation of the requirements set forth in these paragraphs shall
be null and void _ab initio, and the Issuer will have the right to compel any transferee acquiring the_
Notes in violation of the requirements set forth in these paragraphs to sell such Notes or to sell such
Notes on behalf of such transferee.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Whether or not
the Issuer’s underlying assets are deemed to be “plan assets”, an investment in the Notes by a Benefit
Plan Investor is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, Plan Fiduciaries
should consult their own counsel as to the consequences under ERISA and the Code of an investment
in the Notes. Fiduciaries of other plans, in consultation with their advisers, should consider the impact
of their applicable Similar Laws on an investment in the Notes and the considerations discussed
above.

###### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

The Issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. The Account Charge will be governed
by the laws of England and Wales. The Issuer Share Pledge and the Receivables Pledge will be
governed by the laws of Jersey. The Indenture (including any future Guarantee) and the Notes will be
governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the
Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its
directors and executive officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a
U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws, may
not be enforceable in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each
case, in connection with any suit, action or proceedings in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or
under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Issuer
or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. It may be
possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons,
including the Issuer, provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of 15 November 1965 is complied
with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or any of its directors or officers, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has
assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is
summarised in part below for the countries in which the Issuer or the Collateral is located, you should
consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those
countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Jersey**

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in
Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such
an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by
the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts
of laws principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money
(although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognised);

- the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach


-----

of Section 5 of the UK Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural
justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

- there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a
Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced
in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty between them providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil
and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws, would not automatically be recognised or directly enforceable in England and Wales.
In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be
initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English
court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court
(subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such
a claim (summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a
claim without proceeding to trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court
in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts
of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, whether the U.S.
court had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law) at the time when
the original proceedings were initiated;

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause, or in
breach of an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was
to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (except with the agreement of the
relevant parties or the relevant parties’ subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court);

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

- the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the
European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the Human Rights Act 1998 (or
any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English
penal, revenue or other public law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained, and not being otherwise in breach
of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;


-----

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English
court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties, and/or prior inconsistent judgment
given by any other court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales;

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied, or not being enforceable by execution solely
in the United States;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English
court; and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date the U.S.
judgment became enforceable.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognised and/or enforceable in England and Wales. In
addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability
if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales in an original action predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws or other laws.

Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment
if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment
debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor, or if an appeal is pending or
anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Finally, note that, in any proceedings
in England and Wales to enforce a U.S. judgment, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim
that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales, unless
the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

###### LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the_
_Issuer and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organised, and a summary of certain limitations on_
_the validity and enforceability of the security interests for the Notes. The description is only a summary_
_and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect_
_the validity and enforceability of the Notes, any future Guarantee or the security interests. Prospective_
_investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisers with respect to such limitations and_
_considerations._

**Jersey**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of the
Issuer, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for
corporate insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and winding up (including just and equitable winding up
and creditors’ winding up).

The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application
for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as
amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre”
(a “declaration”).

On a declaration of désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in
the Jersey Viscount. With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against
the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Jersey
Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt but may prove in the
_désastre. A secured party may, however, without the consent of the Jersey Viscount and without an_
order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of
Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the
proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the relevant secured party
has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor (except to provide in the désastre
_for the balance of the liabilities), and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the_
consent of the Jersey Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the
balance of the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of
an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of
the Companies Law. On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The
creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will
stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate
disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the
winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of
the Royal Court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence
the creditors’ winding up. A secured party may, however, without the sanction of the liquidator and
without an order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7
(Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such
enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the relevant secured party has no other
remedy against the company without leave of the Royal Court (except to prove in the creditors’ winding
up). The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up
procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Companies Law provides that a creditor of a company
is bound (subject to a right of appeal to the Royal Court) by an arrangement entered into by the
company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if (inter alia) three
quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.


-----

**_Compromises and Arrangements with Creditors_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Companies Law the Royal Court may
sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “scheme of arrangement”) between a Jersey company and
its creditors or shareholders (or a class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on application of the
company (or a creditor or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator) order a
meeting to be called at which the proposed scheme of arrangement must be agreed to by a majority
in number representing:

- 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

- 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers
the sanction of the scheme of arrangement. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of
the relevant class of either of them) agree to the scheme of arrangement and, following such
agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the scheme of arrangement, the scheme of arrangement is
binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either of them) and on the company
(or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Companies Law, the Royal Court
may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction
(including any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other
party”) at an undervalue. There is a five year look back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination
pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and the Companies Law contain
detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an
undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a
person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has
been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a
preference (including any guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the
“other party”). There is a twelve month look back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination
pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and the Companies Law contain
detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the
operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with
the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Companies Law, the Royal Court
may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction
providing credit to the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three year look back
period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and the
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.


-----

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey Viscount may within six months following
the date of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Companies Law, a liquidator may,
within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous
property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract
lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily
saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act,
and includes an unprofitable contract. A disclaimer operates to determine, as at the date it is made,
the rights, interests and liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and
to discharge the company/Viscount from all liability in respect of that property as at the date of the
commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration but it does not, except so
far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or
liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed
to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and, accordingly, may prove for
the loss or damage in the _désastre or the creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and_
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to
disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims may
be set aside.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have
capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the
extent that any floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to
apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey
such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the
Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of
the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and
administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognise the
powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey
situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy
Law, assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity,
assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the
extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the
UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented
as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the
nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting
country’s insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the
UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal
Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation,
because Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of
its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic
law and, for example, the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply.


-----

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences,
extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply
in Jersey (as detailed above).

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of
Jersey law. The Jersey situs assets of the Issuer and certain Jersey situs assets of the Parent will be
secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a
secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of
the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any
bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the
2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement
options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power
of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the
event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale
or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the
grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include
such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give
at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation,
has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has
an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the
secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have
otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On
exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all
commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the
collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable
manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any
agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured
party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to
give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice
requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells
collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give
certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having waived this requirement), any person with a
registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral)
a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If
a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation
or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the
secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in
due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has
registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective
immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the
grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and
in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in
the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the grantor of the security. Alternatively,
the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that
amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the Royal Court
on application by a person entitled to the surplus.

**England and Wales**

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security including: (a) an
insolvency officeholder may sell assets which are subject to a floating charge without permission from
the court or from secured creditors, whereas a court order would usually be required for an insolvency


-----

officeholder to sell a fixed charge asset; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, will have priority as against the floating charge over the same charged assets; (c) costs and
expenses (including the office holder’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up or
administration are generally payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the assets of the
company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them in priority to floating
charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with
assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that
such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good
title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges
under English insolvency law; and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential
creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees
(subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees) and, where the floating charge
is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a
ring fenced amount of the proceeds. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or
liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of
enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this
applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over
£10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000. The obligation on such insolvency officeholder
to set aside the prescribed part for unsecured parties does not apply if the net floating charge
realisations are less than £10,000 and the officeholder is of the view that the costs of making a
distribution to unsecured parties would be disproportionate to the benefits. The prescribed part will
apply to all floating charges created on or after 15 September 2003 regardless of whether or not they
fall within one of the exceptions. Therefore, floating charge realisations could be reduced by the
amount of expenses, preferential creditors and the prescribed part.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise as floating charges any
security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee
does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice, as the description given
to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the
chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to
hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge.

**_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a
“victim” of the relevant transaction can apply to the court pursuant to Section 423 of the Insolvency Act
1986, as amended, for an order to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by that company
on the grounds that the security interest or guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors.

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue and
the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond
the reach of actual potential claims against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make
such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or to protect
the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the
security interest or guarantees), though there is protection for a third-party acting in good faith and for
value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any “victim” of the transaction (with the permission
of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) may apply to the court under this
provision, not merely liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency
legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings, and the relevant company
does not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction.


-----

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each a “Bank Account Charge”), the banks with
which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at
least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Bank Account Charge) to exercise
the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements
with the grantor of that security. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely
a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject
to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts
charged under the relevant Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and
converted into a fixed charge and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the
collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set off rights.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Issuer intends to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Credit Suisse International,
Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, London Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank Corporate
Markets plc and NatWest Markets Plc are the Initial Purchasers.

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement between the Issuer and the
Initial Purchasers, dated on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to
sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers severally have agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the
purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and
not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not
jointly, to purchase all of the Notes if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or
refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the purchase agreement provides that
the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the purchase
agreement may be terminated.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers
may change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice. The
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to
investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes
through certain of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial
Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made
by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any
sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer
affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has
also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
purchase agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that
are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the purchase agreement
through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written
consent of Credit Suisse International.

**General**

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application is expected to
be made to the Authority to list the Notes on the Official List and for permission to be granted to deal
in the Notes on the Official List. There can be no assurance that the application to the Authority to list


-----

the Notes on the Official List will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be
granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission. Certain
of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after
completion of this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may
discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such marketmaking activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if
it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be
favourable to you, if at all.

**_Price Stabilisation and Short Positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilising Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase
and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilising
transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess
of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilising transactions
involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit
the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally
sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short
positions. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result,
the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilising Manager to engage in such transactions and neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilising Manager will engage in these
transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any
stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of
this Offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the
earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any
stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilising Manager (or
persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

**_Initial Settlement_**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the ––––– business day
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+–––––”).
Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required
to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next –––––succeeding business day[s] will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will
settle in T+ –––––, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should
consult their own adviser.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in
the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to the Issuer or the
Target and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive


-----

customary fees and commissions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank
loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Target, the Issuer or their respective affiliates.
The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates will receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary
closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer or the Target consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees
and commissions for these transactions. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
will be lenders and/or agents under our Revolving Credit Facility and have entered into commitment
documents as lenders to provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offering is not
consummated, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.

###### NOTICE TO INVESTORS

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer_
_of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and any potential future Guarantee (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not
be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or

Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Issuer
is offering and selling the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers”, commonly referred to as “QIBs”, as defined
in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A (“QIBs”); and

- outside the United States, to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
accordance with Regulation S, and only to investors who:

  - if in a member state of the EEA, are not a retail investor, where “retail investor” means a
person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II; (b) a customer within the meaning the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of

a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

We use the terms “offshore transaction”, “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given
to them in Regulation S.

property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject
to its or their ability to resell such Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not

CODE, TO THE BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR PLAN FIDUCIARY IN CONNECTION WITH THE
BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR’S INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES AND (Z) THE PLAN FIDUCIARY IS
EXERCISING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE TRANSACTION.

ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF THE NOTES IN VIOLATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS SET

A purchaser of Securities will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities.

(10) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture may have the effect of
extending the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(11) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Securities.

(12) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of
the Securities within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering)
may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(13) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to the Issuer, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set out therein
have been complied with.

the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating
to the Issuer or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under
“Plan of Distribution” and “Important Information”.

(15) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements
deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Securities is no longer accurate, it will promptly
notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more
investor accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to
each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

###### LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION

**Admission to Listing**

Application is expected to be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List, that such
permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

The Notes are only intended to be offered in the primary market to, and held by, investors who are
particularly knowledgeable in investment matters.

**Listing Information**

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, copies
of the following documents may be obtained at the registered office of the Issuer during normal

14 days following the grant of listing of the Notes:

- the organisational documents of the Issuer;

- the Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum; and

- the listing wrapper document in connection with the listing and the Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer has appointed Carey Olsen Corporate Finance Limited as listing agent. The Issuer reserves

be made to the Exchange to have the Notes removed from listing on the Exchange, including if
necessary to avoid any new withholding taxes in connection with the listing.

Except as disclosed in this Offering Memorandum:

claims or amounts which are material in the context of the issue of the Notes, and, so far as we

The prior year adjustment is in respect of a reduction in the deferred tax charge in 2019 by £13.6m offset by an
equal and opposite increase in the deferred tax charge in 2020. This adjustment is in respect of a deferred tax
charge that was recognised in 2019 and reversed in 2020. The reversal in 2020 was incorrectly treated as an in
period adjustment rather than a prior year adjustment. There is no impact on the closing deferred tax liability at
31 December 2020.

 General information and basis of preparation

**General Information**
True Potential Group provides financial advisory and investment management services, and support services to
financial advisers.

The Group is incorporated in England, UK. The address of its registered office is Newburn House, Gateway
West, Newburn Riverside, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE15 8NX.

**Statement of compliance**
The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 104�������������������������������������
applicable in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.

**Going Concern**
These condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. This is appropriate
due to the cash generative nature of the group and expectations of future levels of activity and profit. There is a
net liability position however there are sufficient cash resources and other financing facilities available.
Management have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts which demonstrate that the entity will be able to
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these interim
financial statements.

Throughout the period management have monitored cashflow and covenant compliance very closely, running
daily forward-looking modelling on both cashflow and leverage given the market volatility experienced and
the level of debt held by the group. The forecasts positively show significant headroom to covenant compliance
and capital requirements both throughout the year and at the period ended 30 September 2021. The financial
position of the group is continued to be monitored closely to ensure there are sufficient funds in order to meet
liabilities as they fall due and sufficient headroom on covenants.

**Accounting policies**
The accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent with those of the previous financial year
with the exception of the classification of capitalised costs incurred in respect of the refinancing of the groups
finance facilities in 2019. In the prior year these costs were incorrectly capitalised as an Intangible Asset.
During the current period the directors have reassessed the treatment of these costs and reclassified them to
Borrowings. The related amortisation has been reclassified from Administrative expenses to Interest. There
has been no impact on reported profit or net assets as a result of this reclassification.

 General information and basis of preparation (continued)

**Critical estimates and critical judgements**
The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that effect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from estimates.

In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, with
the exception of estimates that are required for the recognition of creditors due after more than one year.
The key estimates in preparing these interim financial statements are:

**i.** **Carrying value of intangibles**
Intangible assets represent the value of the customer relationships purchased by the firm. In
calculating the value of the intangible asset to be capitalised a conversion rate has been
calculated based on a historical average conversion observed on transactions completed by the
year end date. Conversion rates are adjusted to reflect updated actual experience at each
reporting date and at the date of completion of the purchase. Intangible asset balances are stated
at cost less accumulated amortisation, where management determine their best estimate of the
expected future value of the asset. Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment by the
company. The potential impairment is calculated as the expected future cashflows less the
carrying value of the intangible asset at the reporting date. Management are comfortable with
the carrying value of intangible assets supported by the future benefits of the client relationship

**ii.** **Performance fee**
The fair value of the consideration receivable represents the amount of the performance fee
attributable to the True Potential Growth Aligned Fund Range. The performance fee becomes
payable if the unit price of the fund is above the high watermark, with the high watermark
measured as the highest unit price at each previous 30th April. The performance fee is calculated
as 10% of the fund unit price growth above the high watermark, any performance fee payable is
accrued at a fund level on a daily basis. It is recognised on an accruals basis when it is probable
that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. The recognition of the performance fee is
�����������������������������������������������������������

� Length of time to the fund year end
� Growth over the highwater mark
� Assessment of the equity and capital markets as well as the wider economy

 1 Significant changes in the current reporting period 

 Significant events and transactions

(£9,373,310 recognised in year to 31 December 2020 relating to performance fee period to 30 April
2021)

� Head office refurbishment costs incurred £1.9 million between the period 1 January 2021 to 30

###### 2 Turnover

�����������������������������������������������������������nd arose wholly within the United Kingdom. The
turnover recognised in the year splits by class as follows:

**9 months to** **9 months to** Year to 31

 2. Turnover (continued)

_True Potential Adviser Services LLP_

Turnover represents fees earned from the provision of back-office services to financial advice companies.
Turnover is recognised on a receivable basis and arises fully within the UK.

_True Potential Wealth Management LLP_
Turnover represents fees earned from restricted wealth management advice proposition. Turnover is recognised
on a accruals basis and arises fully within the UK.

_True Potential Investment LLP_

Turnover represents fees earned from provision of a wealth platform and investment funds provider. Turnover
is recognised on a accruals basis and arises fully within the UK. The performance fee is recognised on an
accruals basis when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. The performance fee
accrual was reviewed for the period ended 30 September 2021.

� Length of time from reporting date to fund year end (30th April 2022): 7 months, less than 50%
through the fund year
� Headroom between weighted average unit price and the high watermark at 30 September 2021 was
2.6%.

In conclusion, with more than half the fund year remaining until crystallization and 2.6% headroom to the high
watermark, management feel that the risk is too great to determine that future economic benefits are probable.
Therefore the final assessment will not be necessary for the purpose of the 30 September 2021 9 month interim
financial statements.

###### 3 Tax on profit

Income tax (expense)/credit is recognis�����������������������������������������ed average effective annual
income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The estimated average annual tax rate used for the year to
30 September 2021 is 19%, compared to the 17% for the 9 month period ended 30 September 2020. The tax
rate is lower in 9 month period ended 2020 due to an adjustment to turnover for the reversal of accrued
performance fee between 1 May 2019 and February 2020.

The tax charge in respect of the year ended 31 December 2020 has been restated during the period. The
restatement increased the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2020 by £13.6m (the tax charge for the
year ended 31 December 2019 was reduced by an equal amount). See page 8 for more details.

### Report on the audit of the financial statements

###### Opinion

profit and loss account, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended; the statement of accounting policies; and the notes to the financial statements.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted ou������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
fi�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

###### Conclusions relating to going concern

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the
group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

###### Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency
or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement
of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain
opinions and matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors' report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and
Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

###### Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

###### True Potential Group Limited

# Independent auditors’ report to the members of True Potential Group Limited (continued)

**��������������������������������������������������������������������**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstat��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to UK tax legislation and to the requirements of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 for
firms carrying out regulated financial activities, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a
material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that
the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journals entries to increase revenue or profitability, or through
management bias in manipulation of accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed included:

� Discussions with Management including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with
laws, regulation and fraud;
� Review of Board minutes;
� Review of correspondence with tax authorities and regulators;
� Review of legal expenditure in the year to identify potential non-compliance with laws and regulation;
� Evaluation of Management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;
� Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in
particular in relation to the fair value of investments;
� Designing audit procedures that incorporated unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing to
material financial statement line items; and
� Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries with unusual account combinations.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

###### True Potential Group Limited

 ��������������������������������

**General Information**
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������provide financial
advisory and investment management services, and support services to financial advisers.

The company is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated in England, UK. The address of its
registered office is Newburn House, Gateway West, Newburn Riverside, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE15 8NX.

**Statement of compliance**
The Group and individual financial statements have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
applicable in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies have been applied
consistently.

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated and separate financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under the
historical cost convention, as modified by the recognition of certain financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group and Company accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed below.

The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year are set out below.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act from disclosing its
individual profit and loss account.

**Going Concern**
These consolidated and separate financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. This is appropriate
due the cash generative nature of the group and expectations of future levels of activity and profit. There is a
net liability position however there are sufficient cash resources and other financing facilities available.
Management have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts which demonstrate that the entity will be able to
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial
statements.

Throughout the year management monitored cashflow and covenant compliance very closely, running daily
forward-looking modelling on both cashflow and leverage given the market volatility experienced and the level
of debt held by the group. The forecasts positively show significant headroom to covenant compliance and
capital requirements both throughout the year and at the year-end. The financial position of the group is
continued to be monitored closely to ensure there are sufficient funds in order to meet liabilities as they fall due
and sufficient headroom on covenants.

**Basis of consolidation**
The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its
subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2020.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Where the Group owns less than 50% of the

voting powers of an entity but controls the entity by virtue of an agreement with other investors which give it
control of the financial and operating policies of the entity it accounts for that entity as a subsidiary.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently across the group.

**Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102**
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions, which have
been complied with, including notification of, and no obj��������������������������������������������������
shareholders. The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:

(i) from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial statements, includes the

**Turnover**
Group turnover represents fees earned in respect of work carried out in the year in the ordinary course of
business.

_True Potential Adviser Services_

Turnover is recognised on a receivable basis and arises fully within the UK.

_True Potential Wealth Management_
Turnover represents fees earned from restricted wealth management advice proposition. Turnover is recognised
on a accruals basis and arises fully within the UK.

_True Potential Investment_
Turnover represents fees earned from provision of a wealth platform and investment funds provider. Turnover
is recognised on a accruals basis and arises fully within the UK. The performance fee is recognised on a
receivable basis, when the amount can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits
will flow.

**Performance fee**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable and represents the amount receivable for
the performance fee attributable to the True Potential Growth Aligned Fund Range. The performance fee
becomes payable if the unit price of the fund is above the high watermark, with the high watermark measured
as the highest unit price at each previous 30[th] April. The performance fee is calculated as 10% of the fund unit
price growth above the high watermark, any performance fee payable is accrued at a fund level on a daily
basis.

**Goodwill**
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired. Goodwill is eliminated by amortisation through the profit and loss account over 10 years
on a straight-line basis, which is the presumed useful economic life of goodwill under FRS 102.

 ��������������������������������������������

**Goodwill (continued)**
The brand value recognised at acquisition is held at an initial fair value at acquisition, which has been
calculated using the royalty relief method. In line with the requirements of FRS 102 this fair value is accounted
for as the deemed cost of the brand. The True Potential brand is considered to have a useful life of ten years
and is being amortised over this period.

Positive goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised
on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is deemed to be ten years. It is reviewed for
impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or
charges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When it is determined that
the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the excess is written-off to the profit and loss account.

**Tangible fixed assets**
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price
of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less estimated
realisable value by annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The rates applicable on a straight line
basis are as follows:

Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% - 33.3%
Short leasehold buildings length of lease

**Pension scheme**
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are show as either accruals or prepayments in the balance
sheet.

**Intangible fixed assets and amortisation**
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Cost includes the original purchase
price of the asset. Amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of intangible fixed assets
less estimated realisable value by annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The rates applicable on a
straight line basis are as follows:

Deferred Acquisition Costs 10%

Software Licences 10%

Customer relationships - Amortisation is charged on an annual straight line basis over a period 20 years.
Regular impairment reviews are carried out on the realisable value.

Other intangibles - Amortisation on the group re-financing costs is charged on an annual straight line basis
over the term of the loans.

Platform and other developments are amortised on an annual straight line basis over a period of 10 years.
Regular impairment reviews are carried out on the realisable value.

From the year-end 2019 True Potential Group Limited values its investments on a fair value basis, permitted
under FRS102 para 9.26 and this has resulted in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant
information to the users of the financial statements.

���������������������������������������������������������������� For the year ending 31 December 2020, a fair
value has been established as £913,375,000. This results in a FV movement of £130,978,521 through the profit
and loss of True Potential Group Limited. Consideration has been given to the valuation methodology; market
multiples, comparisons and metrics; and the normalised EBITDA position.

The primary valuation method of EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortisation) has been considered against other valuation approaches. It has been considered the most
appropriate valuation method given the structure of the business and with context to the business sector.
Consideration has been given to the multiple used and the observable transaction in October 2019 (FTV share
buy-back) provides support to the EBITDA multiple applied. Analysis has also been undertaken, comparing
this against comparable listed firms in the industry. Any changes to this the methodology would have a
material impact on the balances recognised in the True Potential Group Limited financial statements. An
increase in the EBITDA multiple by 5% would have a £68.6m impact on the fair value assessment at 31
December 2020. The directors agree that the approach and valuation is appropriate.

The fair value will be assessed on the b�������������������������������������������������������������������������
appropriateness of this valuation will be further assessed as at 31 December 2021.

**Operating leases**
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.

**Taxation**
Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is
recognised in the profit and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity respectively. Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

_(i) Current tax_
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax
is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period
end. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

_(ii) Deferred tax_
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences between taxable profits and total
comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise from the inclusion
of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in
financial statements.

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other
deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period
end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

**Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The estimates and
judgements are based on historical experience and contracted rates, including expectation of future events that
are believed to be reasonable.

The key estimates in preparing these financial statements are:

**i.** **Carrying value of intangibles**
Intangible assets represent the value of the customer relationships purchased by the firm. In calculating
the value of the intangible asset to be capitalised a conversion rate has been calculated based on a
historical average conversion observed on transactions completed by the year end date. Conversion
rates are adjusted to reflect updated actual experience at each reporting date and at the date of
completion of the purchase. Intangible asset balances are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation,
where management determine their best estimate of the expected future value of the asset.

Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment by the company. The potential impairment is
calculated as the expected future cashflows less the carrying value of the intangible asset at the reporting
date. Management are comfortable with the carrying value of intangible assets supported by the future
benefits of the client relationship.

###### True Potential Group Limited

 ��������������������������������������������

**Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty (continued)**

**ii.** **Useful economic life**
Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful life. Future results are impacted by the
amortisation periods adopted, and potentially, may differ between expected and actual circumstances.

Management have considered the wider market and analysed the expected length of the client
relationship when determining the useful economic life.

**iii.** **Carrying value of investments**
Investments values are reviewed annually for impairment by the company. The investment value is
calculated as the expected future cashflows.

**iv.** **Debtors due after more than one year**

Debtors due after more than one year represent the value of loans advanced to new True Potential
Wealth Management advisers based on the value of assets transferred, recognised at transaction cost.
Management closely monitors the recoverability of these loans and consider the risk of default on
repayment to be very low. The loans are only advanced as the assets are transferred and management
has comfort over the value of asset received to support the loan payments. Robust compliance
monitoring of the adviser is in place to ensure that the advisers are fit and proper to continue to
provide advice and service to clients. Management will continue to monitor the recoverability of the
loans closely. Where the amount of debtors due after more than one year is so material in the context
of the total net current assets, it is disclosed on the face of the statement of financial position to
prevent misinterpretation.

**v.** **Performance fee**
The performance fee accrued within the funds and included in turnover as at 31 December 2020 was
£9,376,313, this revenue has been recognized on the basis that it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to the entity. The weighted average unit price at the 31 December 2020 was 111.10
against a weighted average high watermark of 100.67, giving headroom of 10.36% above the high
watermark. As of the 24 February 2021 the weighted average unit price is 111.30, giving headroom of
10.55% above the high watermark. The sensitivity of the performance fee has been analysed, if the
unit price moved by 5% at 31 December 2020 this would result in a £4.7m impact on the performance
accrued.

The performance fee continues to accrue on a daily basis and the fund unit prices will be measured
against the high watermark on the 30 April 2021. The performance fee payable will be paid in cash in
May 2021. If at the 30 April the fund price falls below the high watermark, then no performance fee is
payable to True Potential Investments LLP. The performance fee recognised has been reviewed post
year-end for any material changes.

to the users of the financial statements

���������������������������������������������������������������� For the year ending 31 December 2020, a fair
value has been established as £913,375,000. This results in a FV revaluation of £130,978,521 through the
profit and loss of True Potential Group Ltd. Consideration has been given to the valuation methodology;
market multiples, comparisons and metrics; and the normalised EBITDA position.

The primary valuation method of EV/EBITDA has been considered against other valuation approaches. It has
been considered the most appropriate valuation method given the structure of the business and with context to
the business sector. Consideration has been given to the multiple used, the observable transaction in October
2019 (FTV share buy-back) provides support to the EBITDA multiple applied. Analysis has also been
undertaken, comparing this against comparable listed firms in the industry. Any changes to this the
methodology would have a material impact on the balances recognised in the True Potential Group Ltd
financial statements. The directors agree that the approach and valuation is appropriate.

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
appropriateness of this valuation will be further assessed as at 31 December 2021.

All profits for True Potential LLP for the year are allocated to True Potential Group Limited. A capital
contribution has been made to reinvest the profits back into the subsidiaries. The directors believe the carrying
value of the investments is supported by their underlying future cashflows.

###### True Potential Group Limited

 ��������������������������������

**General Information**
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������provide financial
advisory and investment management services, and support services to financial advisers.

The company is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated in England, UK. The address of its
registered office is Newburn House, Gateway West, Newburn Riverside, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE15 8NX.

**Statement of compliance**
The Group and individual financial statements have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom
����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
applicable in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies have been applied
consistently.

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated and separate financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under the
historical cost convention, as modified by the recognition of certain financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group and Company accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed below.

The company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act from disclosing its
individual profit and loss account.

**Going Concern**
These consolidated and separate financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. This is appropriate
due the cash generative nature of the group and expectations of future levels of activity and profit. There is a
net liability position however there are sufficient cash resources and other facilities available. Management
have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts which demonstrate that the entity will be able to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**
The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its
subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Where the Group owns less than 50% of the
voting powers of an entity but controls the entity by virtue of an agreement with other investors which give it
control of the financial and operating policies of the entity it accounts for that entity as a subsidiary.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently across the group.

**Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102**
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions, which have
been complied with, including �����������������������������������������������������������������������������
shareholders. The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:

(i) from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial statements, includes the
���������������������

**Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty**
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The estimates and
judgements are based on historical experience and contracted rates, including expectation of future events that
are believed to be reasonable.

The key estimates in preparing these accounts are:

**i.** **Provisions, including value of intangibles**
Intangible assets represent the value of the customer relationships purchased by the firm, capitalised
costs relating to the platform and other project developments. In calculating the value of certain
intangible assets to be capitalised a conversion rate has been calculated based on a historical average
conversion observed on transactions completed by the year end date. Conversion rates are adjusted to
reflect updated actual experience at each reporting date and at the date of completion of the
purchase. Intangible asset balances are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, where management
determine their best estimate of the expected future value of the asset.

**ii.** **Useful economic life**
���������������������������������������������������������������������e results are impacted by the
amortisation periods adopted, and potentially, may differ between expected and actual circumstances.

Management have considered the wider market, and analysed the expected length of the client
relationship when determining the useful economic life.

**iii.** **Carrying value of investments**
Investments value are reviewed annually for impairment by the company. The investment value is
calculated as the expected future cashflows.

Historically the Group has valued its investments at historical cost less impairment. The Board has
agreed to change this accounting policy and will now value its investments on a fair value basis. This
change will result in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information to the
users of the financial statements. This basis is permitted under FRS102 para 9.26.

**Goodwill**
Positive goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised
on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is deemed to be ten years. It is reviewed for
impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or
charges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When it is determined that
the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the excess is written-off to the profit and loss account.

**Tangible fixed assets**
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price
of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less estimated
realisable value by annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The rates applicable on a straight line
basis are as follows:

Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% - 33.3%
Short leasehold buildings length of lease

**Pension scheme**
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are show as either accruals or prepayments in the balance
sheet.

**Intangible fixed assets and amortisation**
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired. Goodwill is eliminated by amortisation through the profit and loss account over 10 years
on a straight-line basis, which is the presumed useful economic life of goodwill under FRS 102.

The brand value recognised at acquisition is held at an initial fair value at acquisition, which has been
calculated using the royalty relief method. In line with the requirements of FRS 102 this fair value is accounted
for as the deemed cost of the brand. The True Potential brand is considered to have a useful life of ten years
and is being amortised over this period.

Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Cost includes the original
purchase price of the asset. Amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of intangible fixed
assets less estimated realisable value by annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The rates
applicable on a straight line basis are as follows:

Deferred Acquisition Costs 10%

Software Licences 10%

Other intangibles - Amortisation is charged on an annual straight line basis over a period 20 years. Regular
impairment reviews are carried out on the realisable value.

���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�����������������������������������������������The fair value will be assessed ���������������������������������������
at each balance sheet date in the future.

**Operating leases**
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.

**Taxation**
Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is
recognised in the profit and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity respectively. Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

_(i) Current tax_
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax
is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period
end. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

_(ii) Deferred tax_
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences between taxable profits and total
comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise from the inclusion
of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in
financial statements.

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other
deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period
end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2018 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 had already been substantively enacted on 26
October 2015.

As the change to 17% had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its effects are not included

an operational and a financial perspective. The position continues to evolve rapidly and the ultimate impact
will depend on how the specific circumstances of the pandemic develop.

From a financial perspective the group has not noted any significant impact on financial performance since the
