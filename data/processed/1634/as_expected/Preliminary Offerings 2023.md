###### Preliminary offering memorandum

# Windsor Holdings III, LLC


### $1,800,000,000

   % Senior Secured Notes due 2030
Windsor Holdings III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Issuer”), is offering $1,800,000,000 in aggregate principal
amount of its   % Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the “notes”). The notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the
“indenture”) to be entered into among the Issuer, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto from time to time and Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).


We intend to use the proceeds from the issuance of the notes, together with borrowings under the Credit Facilities (as defined
below), the Equity Contribution (as defined herein) and cash from the balance sheet of Univar Solutions Inc. (the “Company” or
“Univar”), to fund the Transactions (as defined herein) and to pay related fees and expenses.

The issuance of the notes may occur prior to the closing of the Merger (as defined herein). If so, on the issue date, pending the
consummation of the Merger, the gross proceeds from this offering of the notes will be deposited into a segregated escrow
account (with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as escrow agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement) together with additional
amounts (or, pursuant to letters of credit or equity commitment letters, rights to receive all or a portion of such amounts) from
time to time as described under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” until the date that
the Escrow Conditions (as defined herein) are satisfied. Prior to the release of the notes proceeds from escrow, the escrow account
and the funds therein will be pledged on a first-priority basis as collateral for the benefit of holders of the notes. If the Escrow
Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to January 31, 2024, or such earlier date as the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that
the Escrow Conditions cannot be satisfied or upon the occurrence of certain other events described in this offering memorandum,
the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price for the notes is 100% of the
issue price of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption.
See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If the issuance of the notes occurs on the
closing date of the Merger (the “Merger Closing Date”), none of the escrow provisions described in this offering memorandum
will be applicable, no proceeds of this offering will be deposited into the escrow account and all such proceeds will be provided to
the Issuer on the issue date for use as described under “Use of Proceeds.” References in this offering memorandum to the
“Release Date” refer to (i) the issue date, if this offering closes on the date of the closing of the Merger and (ii) otherwise, the date
of release of the notes proceeds from escrow.

Prior to the Release Date, the notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. From and after the Release Date,
the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Issuer’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that
guarantees the Issuer’s new senior secured first lien term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). For so long as the Term Loan
Facility remains outstanding, to the extent lenders under the Term Loan Facility release the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor,
such subsidiary guarantor will also be released from its obligations under the notes.

From and after the Release Date, the notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on the Notes Priority
Collateral (as defined herein and which generally includes most of the Issuer’s and subsidiary guarantors’ assets other than the
ABL Priority Collateral (as defined herein)) and by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (which generally includes
most of the Issuer’s and subsidiary guarantors’ inventory and accounts receivable and related assets), in each case subject to
certain exceptions and permitted liens as described herein. The Issuer’s new senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility
(the “ABL Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) will be secured by first-priority liens on
the ABL Priority Collateral and similar assets of certain foreign subsidiaries that will be borrowers or guarantors under the ABL
Facility but not subsidiary guarantors of the notes or the Term Loan Facility, and by second-priority liens on the Notes Priority
Collateral, in each case as described herein. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

From and after the Release Date, the notes and related guarantees will rank (i) equally in right of payment with all existing and
future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors, (ii) senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the notes, (iii) effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the
subsidiary guarantors, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the notes, (iv) effectively senior to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors secured by a junior-priority lien on the collateral, to the extent of the
value of the collateral securing the notes, (v) effectively senior to all indebtedness of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors
under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral, (vi) effectively junior to all indebtedness of the
Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral, (vii)


-----

subordinated to all obligations of each of the Issuer s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the notes, including the Issuer s
foreign subsidiaries that are obligors under the ABL Facility.

We will pay interest on the notes on         and         of each year. The first such payment will be made on           ,
2023. The notes will mature on           , 2030. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or
after           , 2026 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes prior to           ,
2026 in an amount not to exceed the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to           , 2026, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the applicable “make-whole”
premium set forth in this offering memorandum. There is no sinking fund for the notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notes
may be redeemed pursuant to a special mandatory redemption as described above.

**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36 to read about important factors you should consider before investing in the**
**notes.**

**Offering price of the notes:   % plus accrued interest, if any, from           , 2023.**

**The issuance and sale of the notes and the related guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.**
**Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the notes are**
**being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A**
**under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on**
**Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified**
**that the seller of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided**
**by Rule 144A. The notes are not transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer**
**Restrictions.”**

**Currently, there is no public market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities**
**exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated dealer quotation system. We are not obligated under any**
**registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the notes and the related guarantees for resale or to exchange**
**the notes and the related guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of**
**any other jurisdiction.**

The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to investors on or about             , 2023 in book entry form through the
facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the accounts of its participants, including Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as
operator of the Euroclear System, and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

This offering memorandum is highly confidential. You should carefully read the information contained in
this offering memorandum. We have not, and the initial purchasers have not, authorized anyone to provide you with
information that is different than the information provided herein. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no
assurances as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. This offering memorandum may
only be used where the offer and sale of the notes is permitted. The information contained in this offering
memorandum is as of the date hereof and subject to change, completion or amendment without notice. The delivery
of this offering memorandum at any time shall not, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has
been no change in the information contained in this offering memorandum or in our affairs since the date of this
offering memorandum. If you do not purchase the notes or the offering is terminated for any reason, you agree to
return this offering memorandum to: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York
10179.

This offering memorandum has been prepared by us based on information we have or have obtained from
sources we believe to be reliable. Summaries of documents contained in this offering memorandum may not be
complete, and we refer you to such documents for a more complete understanding of what we discuss in this
offering memorandum. The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the

financial condition and other information described herein may change after such date. You should consult your own
legal, tax and business advisors regarding an investment in the notes. Information in this offering memorandum is
not legal, tax or business advice.

You should base your decision to invest in the notes solely on information contained in this offering
memorandum. Neither we nor the initial purchasers have authorized anyone to provide you with any different
information either in verbal or written form. Univar’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) are not incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum and you should not base your decision to
invest in the notes on any information in Univar’s filings with the SEC that is not contained in this offering
memorandum. In making any investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of us
and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe
anything in this offering memorandum as legal, business or tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its
own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase
the notes under applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations.

Contact the initial purchasers with any questions concerning this offering or to obtain documents or
additional information to verify the information in this offering memorandum.

We are offering the notes in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act for an offer
and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. If you purchase the notes, you will be deemed to have
made certain acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.” You may

or sale of the notes is not permitted. We do not make any representation to you that the notes are a legal investment
for you.

Each prospective purchaser of the notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in
any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the notes and must obtain any consent, approval or permission
required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and neither we nor the initial
purchasers shall have any responsibility therefor.

**None of the SEC, any state securities commission or any other regulatory authority has approved or**
**disapproved of the notes or determined if this offering memorandum is truthful or complete. Any**
**representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about          , 2023,
which will be the        business day following the date of pricing of the notes, or “T+      .” Under Rule 15c6
ii


-----

1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes before the second business day prior to the anticipated settlement
date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+  , to specify an alternate
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Such purchasers should consult their
own advisors.

The initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the
notes, including over-allotment, stabilizing and short-covering transactions in the notes and the imposition of a
penalty bid during and after this offering of the notes. Such stabilization, if commenced, may be discontinued at any
time. For a description of these activities, see “Plan of Distribution.”

We have prepared this offering memorandum solely for use in connection with the offer of the notes to
persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S.
persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. You agree that you will hold
the information contained in this offering memorandum and the transactions contemplated hereby in
confidence. You may not distribute this offering memorandum or disclose any information in this offering
memorandum to any person, other than a person retained to advise you in connection with the purchase of the
notes. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and to make no copies of this
offering memorandum or any documents referred to herein. We and the initial purchasers may reject any offer to
purchase the notes in whole or in part, sell less than the entire principal amount of the notes offered hereby or
allocate to any purchaser less than all of the notes for which it has subscribed.

THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION
THEREFROM. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO
BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. SEE

iii


-----

definitive agreements. Copies of the definitive agreements will be made available without charge to you in response

**NO REVIEW BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information that would be
required if this offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. This offering
memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed by the
SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the notes, and we have no intention to offer notes registered
under the Securities Act in exchange for the notes offered in this offering or to file a registration statement with
respect to the notes. The indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

This offering memorandum contains historical financial statements and financial information of Univar for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023.
Univar’s fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year.

The Issuer was formed on March 9, 2023 and has conducted limited activities prior to the Transactions.
Therefore, no historical financial statements or financial information of the Issuer are presented in this offering
memorandum.

This offering memorandum also presents unaudited pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2023 gives effect to the Transactions as if they
occurred on March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data gives
effect to the Transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, including the historical financial data and
pro forma adjustments for the Transactions, has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022, and then adding the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31,
2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 and the unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the three
months ended March 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022 are based on the historical consolidated audited annual and unaudited interim financial statements of Univar.
The unaudited pro forma data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma
information presented in this offering memorandum is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the Transactions been
completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information presented in this offering
memorandum does not purport to project our future financial position or operating results.

The information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to, and does not, comply with all of
the disclosure requirements of the SEC that would apply if this offering were being made pursuant to a registration
statement filed with the SEC. Additionally, the financial information included in this offering memorandum will not
be subject to review by the SEC. Compliance with such requirements could require the modification or exclusion of
certain financial measures and/or other information included in this offering memorandum and the inclusion of
certain information not included in this offering memorandum.

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this offering memorandum to
“we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to the Issuer and each of its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect
to the Merger.

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

We present EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization in this offering memorandum because we believe they provide
investors with additional information to measure our performance and evaluate our ability to service our
indebtedness. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization is appropriate to provide
additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about certain items that we do not
expect to continue at the same level in the future as well as other items. Further, we believe Reported Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before
Normalization provide a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use the metrics for evaluating our
business performance and understanding certain significant items.

EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization are not presentations made in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and our use of the terms EBITDA, Reported Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before
Normalization varies from others in our industry. EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization should not be considered as
alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of
operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization have important
limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our
results as reported under GAAP. For example,

EBITDA:

    - excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;

    - does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and
amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;

    - does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments, on our indebtedness; and

    - excludes the impact of certain non-operating accounts, such as interest income.

In addition, Reported Adjusted EBITDA:

    - excludes impairment charges;

    - excludes the impact of gain and losses on the sale of businesses;

    - excludes transaction and integration related expenses;

    - excludes stock-based compensation expense;

    - excludes restructuring charges, employee severance costs and facility closure costs;

    - excludes multi-employer pension plan exit liability, certain pension gains and non-operating retirement
benefits;

v


-----

    - excludes gain on sale of property, plant and equipment;

    - excludes the impact of gains and losses due to foreign currencies;

    - excludes the impact of undesignated derivate instruments, debt refinancing costs and fair value
adjustments for warrants;

    - excludes discrete tax items; and

    - excludes certain other adjustments, which may include non-recurring and/or non-cash income and
expenses.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA:

    - includes the impact of transactional gains and losses due to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations;

    - aligns rent expense, which is recorded on a straight-line basis, to actual cash outflows per the lease
agreements, in accordance with GAAP;

    - excludes the impact of other non-recurring items, such as sublease income and an environmental
provision, as well as the equal and offsetting insurance recovery receivable; and

    - excludes certain net losses from unconsolidated joint ventures net of cash dividends received.

Further, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA:

    - excludes the impact of the supply chain disruption and destocking in 2022, including a normalization
adjustment for temporary pricing surges within the first three fiscal quarters of 2022, as well as
subsequent destocking in the fourth quarter of 2022;

    - includes estimated cost savings and acquisition related synergies;

    - excludes the impact of exited businesses and includes the pre-acquisition impact of acquired
businesses; and

    - does not reflect the impact of earnings, charges or expenses resulting from matters that we may
consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations.

Further, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization:

    - includes the impact of the supply chain disruption and destocking in 2022 that is excluded from the
calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Reported Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods is consistent with the basis of presentation of “Adjusted
EBITDA” in Univar’s prior public filings and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included
in this offering memorandum. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum differs from the
presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in Univar’s prior public filings for the reasons stated above. Our definitions of
Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
Before Normalization allow us to add back certain non-cash and non-recurring charges or costs that are deducted in
calculating net income. However, some of these are expenses that involved cash, may recur, vary greatly and are
difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition,
certain of these expenses can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes.

vi


-----

Because of these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results and use EBITDA, Reported Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before
Normalization only supplementally.

For more information on the use of non-GAAP financial information, see “Summary—Summary Historical
and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

We include statements and information in this offering memorandum concerning our industry ranking and
the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations and market opportunity, which are based on
information from independent industry organizations and other third-party sources. We have not independently
verified any third-party information and such information is inherently imprecise. In addition, projections,
assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the industry in which we operate and our future performance
are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described
in “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from
those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

**TRADEMARKS**

This offering memorandum contains references to our trademarks and service marks, including “Univar”,
“Univar Solutions”, and the stylized Univar Solutions logo. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names
referred to in this offering memorandum may appear without the [®] or TM symbols, but such references are not
intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the
rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. Other trademarks and tradenames appearing in
this offering memorandum are the property of their respective holders. We do not intend our use or display of other
companies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of
us by, any other companies.

**DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

“predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “plan,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “future,” “project,” “estimate,” and
similar expressions (or the negative of such expressions) are forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statements contained in this offering memorandum are qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking
statements are made based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a
number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including those described under “Risk Factors.” Should one or more
of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected. There are a number of important factors that could
cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements,
including, among other things, risks relating to the expected timing, consummation, and financial benefits of the
Merger. Other risk factors include, but are not limited to:

    - general economic conditions, particularly fluctuations in industrial production and consumption and
the timing and extent of economic downturns, and increased competitive pressures, including as a
result of competitor consolidation;

    - significant changes in the business strategies of producers or in the operations of our customers;

**Our Company**

We are a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as
a provider of value-added services, to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase
chemicals and ingredients from thousands of producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute,
transport, and sell those materials safely to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120
countries.

Our go-to-market approach focuses on leveraging the scale of our operations and our local industry
and geographic knowledge to create differentiated value for our customers and suppliers. This is primarily
achieved through our Chemicals & Services (“C&S”) channel, through which we can leverage the scale of our
operations and is intensely focused on customer service, and our Ingredients & Specialties (“I&S”) channel,
which focuses on specialty chemicals and ingredients paired with in-depth technical expertise. This dualchannel approach allows us to meet the specific needs of each customer across their entire product
development, commercialization, and raw material purchasing journey, creating value across the entire
customer production chain. Our C&S channel features a broad portfolio of commodity products and we
believe that our focus on customer service in this business channel allows us to gain a competitive advantage
over other players operating in the market. Our I&S channel leverages the breadth of our supplier and
customer relationships and a technically focused sales process aimed at achieving new authorizations and
customer and volume retention.

We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, including
approximately 9,700 employees and 600 facilities, supported by the largest private transportation fleet in the
industry: approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers; and approximately 2,500 railcars, 120 rail and
barge terminals and 20 deep sea terminals, focused on timely and safe delivery to a spectrum of customers,
large and small. With our global sales force, a vast supplier network, unparalleled logistics know-how, deep
market and regulatory knowledge, world-class formulation and recipe development, and industry-leading
digital tools, we are committed to helping customers and suppliers anticipate and navigate today’s challenges
and capture the meaningful growth opportunities that exist in their industries.

Beyond traditional distribution services, our value-added services include e-commerce, digital
marketing, chemical waste management, on-site storage, packaging, private label and technical application
and formulation support for industries such as Beauty and Personal Care, Food, Pharma, Coatings, Adhesives,
Sealants and Elastomers (“CASE”), Lubricants and Metalworking, Homecare and Industrial Cleaning,

Agricultural, Water Treatment, and Electronics. Our scale, along with our dense logistics network, longstanding regulatory permits, exclusive product offering of premier brands, centralized business technology
infrastructure, industry-leading safety record, and value-added services, along with established relationships
with the leading chemicals and ingredients producers in our industry allow us to meet the end market,
technical development, and material supply needs of our customers, while serving as an extension of our
premier suppliers. This approach allows us to execute an intense focus on service, while lowering costs.

While the global chemical distribution industry is large and highly fragmented, with thousands of
distributors, it represents a relatively small portion of all chemical industry sales. While the total chemical and
ingredient industry is projected to grow at rates close to the gross national product of the countries in which
we operate around the world, the distributed chemicals portion of the industry is projected to grow at a faster
rate as producers and customers increasingly realize the economic benefits of this channel. Suppliers rely on
us to warehouse, repackage, transport, market and sell their products as a way to expand their industry access,
enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase
products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their
chemical and ingredient sourcing process through access to just-in-time delivery, excellent product
availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe
and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals fully compliant with increasing local and federal regulations.

Chemical distributors play an essential role within the global chemical and ingredient value chain by
providing customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals that create value-added products. While certain
chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also thousands of
smaller, regional customers who may be more economically served by distributors given their more “local” reach
and last-mile expertise.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $2.7 billion in net sales, $83.1 million of net
income and $215.4 million in Reported Adjusted EBITDA. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we
generated $11.5 billion in net sales, $545.3 million of net income and $1,045.9 million in Reported Adjusted
EBITDA. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $11.3 billion in net sales, $447.6
million of net income, $972.7 million in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and $1,028.0 million in Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics, see “—Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data.”

**_Products and End Markets_**

We source and inventory commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such
as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads directly from producers and break down the bulk quantities to
repackage, market, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.

In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our
transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous
materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our
customers. We also have state-of-the-art solution centers at locations across the globe, consisting of
formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and
innovative technical capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product
development cycles. Each of these locations is staffed by a team of chemists and food scientists, many with
doctorate-level educations. At the heart of our business model are our highly trained professionals with deep
industry experience within the specific markets they serve.

We serve a diverse set of end markets and regions, with no end market accounting for more than 18%
of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The following charts illustrate the geographical
and end market diversity of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022:

We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the
market and allow us to compete across our end markets:

    - we operate an expansive North American site network and approximately 80% of our U.S.

manufacturing GDP is located within a 60-minute drive time from one or more of our facilities;

    - we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and maintain appropriate inventory levels

throughout the year to ensure security of supply to our customers;

    - we have invested in a strong digital platform that allows us to identify orders, target customers,

access real-time pricing information and ensure the availability of freight-logical product where
and when it is needed;

    - we offer competitive pricing for our products while delivering attractive levels of profitability; and

    - we are contracted and work closely with the leading suppliers in the industry and maintain an

expert sales force with deep ties to customers to market and sell their product into the market.

We have established clear goals within our C&S channel. We are targeting organic growth of over 100
basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 22% over the next three to five years.

We also have clear strategic priorities for C&S to ensure we continue to gain share within our core
markets and continue our track record of delivering strong growth, including:

    - execution of strategic capital investments to ensure high levels of service, improved safety and
the ability to maximize growth in a dynamic market;

    - continuing to compete successfully at the local level with global scale, matching the intensity of
our more regional competitors with our advantageous size and scale; and

    - remaining “Easy to Do Business With” for our customers and suppliers as a trusted distributor in
our industry.

_I&S. Our Ingredients and Specialties channel serves a more value added, higher-growth portion of the_
market tailored to specific end market requirements. For each I&S market, we have dedicated sales, marketing,
product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of the markets they serve. We
represent approximately 500 strategic specialty and ingredient chemical suppliers and sell their portfolios to
approximately 42,000 customer locations around the world. These specialty products are typically sold in lower
volumes, but at a higher gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), than commodity products. These products
also tend to provide “sticky” business as they become vital components to customers’ procurement needs.

In I&S, sustained growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce effectiveness, delivering solutions
through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our comprehensive supply chain
infrastructure. I&S focuses on seven global markets and is serviced through our Life Sciences (Beauty &
Personal Care, Food Ingredients and Pharmaceutical Ingredients) and Industrial Solutions (CASE, Homecare
& Industrial Cleaning and Lubricant & Metalworking Fluids) businesses.

We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the
market and allow us to compete across our customer and end markets:

    - strong formulation know-how and application laboratories to innovate with customers, including
through our industry-leading laboratory capabilities;

    - ability to meet our customers’ needs with a comprehensive product portfolio and industry focus
sales, marketing and product management;

    - reliable “on time in full” delivery and supply assurance, underpinned by strong relationships
between customers and company service representatives; and

    - partnerships with high-quality suppliers and brands with high-quality products across end
markets, including securing exclusive relationships for premium parts of our portfolio where we
operate symbiotically with our suppliers.

**Our Mission**

We believe that we are well positioned to drive profitable growth, increase our market share and
capitalize on industry outsourcing trends by focusing on our key initiatives to Streamline, Innovate, and Grow.

_Streamline. We are committed to continuously improving our operating performance and lowering_
our costs per transaction. In particular, we seek to:

    - align our business teams with identified growth opportunities in customer end markets, product
markets, services, and industries in a way that narrows focus and increases accountability;

    - increase our use of digital tools to simplify tasks, lower costs and improve customer experience;

    - continue to use Lean Six Sigma methodologies to deliver project-by-project productivity gains;

    - increase the cost efficiency of our warehouses, terminals, tank farms and logistics, and improve
our net working capital efficiency;

    - deliver a compelling customer value proposition by providing simplified sourcing, cost effective
just-in-time delivery and managed inventory along with value-added services; and

    - continue to build on our industry leading safety performance, and sustainability initiatives as a
differentiator with both customers and producers.

We have identified significant incremental opportunities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs
throughout the organization. The five key areas to be targeted span across: (1) Organization, general and
administration; (2) Fleet & logistics Improvement; (3) Procurement; (4) Go-to-Market strategy; and (5)
Warehouse improvement & commercial efficiencies. Between approximately $114 and $211 million of cost
saving opportunities have been identified by an independent third-party study, approximately $40 million of
which was already announced to the market in 2022 by Univar as a part of the Value Capture program. We are
estimating that we will be able to achieve an additional $75 million of cost savings above previous 2023
targets and believe this will take between 12 and 18 months to realize with one-time implementation costs of
approximately $37 million.

_Innovate. We intend to deliver our digital transformation by combining the most advanced ERP and_
smart asset “Internet of Things” technology. We intend to enrich the customer and supplier experience with
market leading tools and quality processes that will further separate us from our competitors. We expect that
our superior market intelligence and analytics capabilities will allow us to predict trends and lead innovations.

We believe our digital expertise will help us deliver end-to-end supply chain solutions, from our
suppliers’ manufacturing facilities right through to our customers’ machines, allowing us to work as an
extension of their teams and networks to create a whole new level of new ecosystem for our industry.

industries and applications. Our technical team comprises both lab-based and field-based experts, many with
doctorate and other advanced degrees in their scientific field.

_Grow. We believe our initiatives will allow us to outperform competitors, leading to market share_
gains. We will continue to streamline and enhance our customer experience in order to be the most customerfriendly distributor to do business with and to increase customer preference for Univar Solutions. In addition,
we believe our industry-focused go-to-market strategy combined with innovative sales and marketing support
and strong customer preference will lead to winning additional product authorizations from suppliers. In
particular, we seek to:

    - further develop a highly skilled and well-equipped sales force utilizing a value-based
consultative sales approach that is aligned to customer and end market needs by geography,
product, service and industry specialization;

    - continue to increase our technical and industry-specific product and market expertise;

    - develop a world-class marketing capability to dynamically identify and align resources with
high-growth, high value opportunities;

    - cultivate and maintain long-term producer relationships through deep market and product
knowledge, value-based selling, reduced complexity in distribution channels and offering
complementary products and services as a total solution for our customers;

    - offer industry leading digital solutions that drive customer and supplier preference, enhance
supply chain efficiency, empower employees with valuable insights and provide new sources of
profitable growth through innovation; and

    - evaluate strategic acquisitions to increase our presence and develop competitive advantage in
attractive end markets and with products and service capabilities that benefit from our scale
advantages.

We are committed to developing a healthy, high-performance culture through the selection,
recognition and development of our employees. We aspire to build an environment where the best people want
to work and add value for our customers, producers and shareholders. We will strengthen the overall
governance and efficiency of our global business operations with integrated, disciplined operating processes
and by leveraging best practices.

**Industry Overview**

Chemical distributors play an essential role within the global chemical value chain by providing
customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals that create value-added products. While certain
chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also thousands of

-----

smaller, regional customers who may be may be more economically served by distributors given their more
“local” reach and last-mile expertise. Distributors fill this gap by purchasing chemicals and ingredients from
producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell those chemicals to customers
through a more regional supply chain and at volumes that may be meaningfully below traditional order sizes
for producers. The chemical distribution market is highly fragmented due to the diverse range of products,
services, customers, and its regionalized nature.

While the industry consists of tens of thousands of players, scaled distributors have some competitive
advantages due to their existing capital investment, significant logistics networks and experience operating in a
highly regulated environment. As of 2022, the estimated size of the market for chemical consumption is
approximately $4,800 billion, of which approximately $1,500 billion is for chemicals considered nondistributable (e.g., products that travel to customers through pipelines), resulting in a market for distributable
chemical consumption of approximately $3,300 billion. Within this market, it is estimated that only 11% is
currently served through distributors globally.

Since 2015, the distribution market has grown steadily at approximately 3-5% year over year. From
2019-2022, the market experienced an increased growth rate of approximately 4-5%, underpinned by increased
pricing throughout COVID-19 driven by supply chain constraints, which is expected to normalize in 2023. In
the period from 2023 through 2027, the chemical distribution market is expected to grow at approximately 45%.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We derive our strength and competitive advantage from our global scale and capabilities, comprised
of transportation, storage infrastructure, exclusive authorizations of premier brands, depth and breadth of
product offering, a trained, highly skilled salesforce, industry-leading safety, regulatory, and quality,
sustainability leadership, long-standing relationships with producers, and technical differentiation, along with
our industry-leading service levels. Our private fleet enables us to provide same day and next day service to
many of our customers, which would not be feasible through many common carriers. This results in a higher
degree of security and reliability to our customers, as we are able to control our supply chain and manage our
costs better than if we were on the open marketplace.

In addition, our propriety technology platform enables us to centralize our data and exchange
information in real-time. This is highly scalable for customers, suppliers, markets, regions, and ensures our
success in the digital future. Management discipline around data and analytics drives superior demand
planning, pricing, optimization of our operations, and last mile expertise to control the inherent complexity of the
distribution business.

Our channel approach to market across C&S and I&S allows us to meet the service, portfolio and
technical needs of our global customer base in a manner that is relevant to their specific industry and
geographic needs, providing a small distributor feel of intimacy to our customers. Coupling this with our scale,
network, and intense focus on service allows us to win differentially in the market. Overall, our ability to lead
across the factors that matter most to our customers across both channels enables us to be one of the leaders
across the chemical distribution industry.

**_Attractive industry with significant demand tailwinds in strong end markets to fuel long-term organic growth_**

Chemicals distributors serve as key intermediaries between customers and producers to sell products
that are cost-ineffective for larger producers. We are well positioned to benefit from the growing trend of
chemical and ingredient producers and customers outsourcing key tasks to distributors. Third-party chemical
and ingredient distribution represents a small portion of the market, with distributors underpenetrated relative
to other industries (including building materials, steel, auto parts and others). However, the market remains
large with global third-party chemical distribution industry sales of approximately $320 billion in 2022.
Historically, chemical distribution was viewed as a channel to reach smaller customers but is increasingly
important to larger customers. The relatively low current penetration rate, combined with rising regulatory
requirements, an increased focus on ESG, customer regionalization, and supplier globalization, are expected to
be strong tailwinds for increased outsourcing penetration across both specialty and commodity chemicals. It is
a highly fragmented industry with a significant number of small, local participants; our scale provides a
meaningful competitive advantage.

As a full-line distributor with a strong, highly scaled supply-chain-network across a broad geographic
region, we are well suited to help customers and producers consolidate their distributor relationships and lower
their total costs of ownership while improving upon their service levels. Amidst a backdrop of industry-wide
underinvestment in software and digitization, we have a “First Mover” advantage derived from our leading
proprietary platform. Our advanced centralized business platform simplifies logistics and reduces complexity
and costs. As one of the leaders in chemical and ingredient distribution, we believe we can accelerate this trend
by increasing the attractiveness of our total value proposition to both customers and our suppliers.

**_Truly global platform with expansive scale and market access – #1 in North America and #2 in EMEA – powered_**
**_by centralized business technology solution_**

We operate one of the most extensive chemical and ingredient distribution networks in the world,
comprising more than 600 distribution facilities, approximately 90 million gallons of chemical storage tank
capacity and hundreds of tractors, railcars, tankers and trailers operating daily through our facilities. Our rail
and barge network, which consists of approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers, approximately 2,500
railcars, 120 rail & barge terminals, and 20 deep sea terminals, provides an irreplicable logistics network. This
highly responsive service level enables our customers to lower their inventory levels while relying on the
security of supply our scale and supplier relationship enables us to provide.

-----

The images below display show the locations of our distribution centers, site locations and industryleading density compared to our competitors, respectively:

Our scaled business model and numerous access points to the market enables a high level of
diversification across suppliers, customers, products and end markets:

    - our top 10 customers represent approximately 6% of our sales;

    - we offer over 15,000 products within our portfolio, with our top 15 products representing less
than 20% of our gross profit; and

    - none of our end markets represents more than approximately 18% of our sales.

We believe our purchasing power and global procurement relationships provide us with advantages
over local and regional competitors due to economies of scale. We purchase thousands of different chemicals
and ingredients from thousands of producers with flexible supply agreements without specific obligations to
buy, allowing us to manage our working capital. Additionally, many of our supply relationships for premier
brand are exclusive, providing us “sticky” business opportunities with additional pricing power.

**_Unique value proposition, positioning the business as the top choice for customers_**

Quality of service and maintaining close connections to customers is critical in distribution and an
area where we differentiate ourselves against our competitors. Our model and go-to-market approach benefit
our customers in multiple ways and we provide a range of value-added services beyond simple product
transportation, including:

    - safe and responsible handling, warehousing, and delivery with industry leading safety and
security ratings;

    - packaging sized to fit customers’ needs and tailored solutions including private label services;

    - a comprehensive portfolio of branded products and services that emphasize sustainable solutions;

    - relationships with the leading suppliers for any given product and application, including 67 new
supplier authorizations in 2022;

    - investment in digital tools that enable customers to search, select, source, and self-serve with
real-time results 24/7;

    - global scale, providing security of supply and reduced vendor lists;

    - robust sales, marketing, product management, and technical teams service the needs of the industries
and regions where we do business;

    - technical expertise and on-demand product support; and

    - simplified, safe, and reliable sourcing with a lower total cost of ownership for customers.

**_Long-standing and strong relationships with premier global suppliers_**

We have developed strong, long-term relationships, many spanning several decades, with the world’s
premier global chemical and ingredient producers. Today, we distribute their products to more than 100,000
customer locations around the globe, from small and medium sized businesses to global corporate accounts.
Our global network of over 1,300 suppliers provide diversification (our top 10 suppliers represent
approximately 41% of our chemical & ingredient purchases for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022) and
supply chain resiliency while maintaining security of supply. Supplier relationship lengths of over 40 years
have provided opportunities for us to integrate our service and logistics capabilities into our customers’ and
producers’ business processes while promoting collaboration on supply chain optimization, marketing and
other revenue enhancement strategies. We are able to offer a compelling and industry leading value
proposition to each of our suppliers, which underpins our ability to retain and expand our product offering.
Key points of differentiation include:

    - expand supplier reach by providing local market and industry specific knowledge and presence;

    - business intelligence allows suppliers to focus on production rather than customer service;

    - leading digital infrastructure to reduce complexity and costs while driving market penetration
and demand growth; and

    - knowledge of global trends across consumer and industrial markets to allow placing of supplier
products with right customers at right time.

**_Highly resilient business model with cash generative financial profile and an inherent downside hedge_**

Our distributor business model is highly resilient to recessionary periods. The earnings and cash flow
we generate benefits from the substantial diversity of our customers, end markets and geographic presence.
Since 2007, we have been able to consistently improve our Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin across
recessionary periods including the “Great Financial Crisis” (“GFC”), the oil price crash of 2015 and 2016, and
the COVID-19 pandemic, where our ability to work with both customers and suppliers to provide product at a
time of global supply chain disruption led to record profitability.

**_Value creation through the Nexeo Acquisition_**

Our 2019 combination with Nexeo Solutions (“Nexeo”) solidified our position as the largest chemical
and ingredients distribution sales force, broadest product offering and most efficient supply chain network in
North America. The Nexeo acquisition further enhanced the profitability and scale of our business, providing
us with, among other things:

    - approximately $130 million of acquired EBITDA (pro forma for the divestiture of Nexeo’s
plastics business);

    - a meaningful increase in the size of the North American logistics platform, strengthening our
presence in its key end markets and underpinning the buildout of a global high quality I&S
organization;

    - an alignment of business models, go-to-market strategies, superior product offerings, and digital
capabilities, which leveraged the strengths of the acquired Nexeo assets;

    - an expansion of our product portfolio and offering, particularly in specialty chemicals and
ingredients;

    - a truly market-leading SAP platform, providing us access to the premier digital platform in
chemical distribution, with existing integrated pricing and AI tools, with a highly synchronized
integration with our existing digital solutions offering; and

    - formation of an all-internal team to lead the integration, proving-out our capabilities as a sector
consolidator.

At the time of the Nexeo acquisition, we expected the combination to deliver $100 million of annual
run-rate cost savings by the third year following close. As of March 31, 2023, we had realized $125 million of
run-rate cost savings, following the integration of the business, as shown in the chart below:

Overall, the Nexeo acquisition solidified Univar Solutions’ position as a leading player in North
America and transformed the business through increased scale, improved end market position, and the
implementation of a high end digital platform.

**_Safety and sustainability_**

Our safety culture is embedded into everything we do at Univar Solutions. Safety is foundational in
planning for operations, products, processes and facilities. Specific initiatives include, among others, data
driven and causality-based accident prevention work, improved process and facility controls, mandatory
general education and role specific safety training, joint management-worker health and safety committees,
safety audits, incident investigation and improvement measures.

Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in global safety metrics during the last seven
years. We track worker injuries using the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (“OSHA”)
standardized methodology of Total Case Incident Rate (“TCIR”) which is the rate of recordable injuries per
200,000 hours worked. 2022 was our safest year on record with a TCIR of 0.33, compared with 0.40 in 2021
and ahead of our 2025 target of 0.38.

We believe this results in a competitive advantage by:

    - maintaining and improving relationships with our customers and suppliers, who view safety
performance as a key criterion for vendor selection;

    - improving employee recruitment and retention; and

    - reducing the likelihood of incidents and enabling our employees to focus on their contributions.

Additionally, we believe our focus on safety improves our service, productivity and financial performance.

We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that
meet growing customer and societal sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that
our ability to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance
environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities
presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and industry developments.

We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to these expectations through our global
sustainability goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while
addressing remediation, reducing resource use, progressing responsible sourcing and bringing more
sustainable solutions to market. In 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact,
reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular

Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, David Jukes, who has been with us for
over 21 years and has over 39 years of experience in the chemical and ingredient distribution industry. Since
mid-2012, our senior management team has implemented an enhanced business strategy and successfully

Since becoming the CEO in 2018, David and the team have transformed our business into a business
with over $1 billion Reported Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and have created an organization with higher
margins, lower exposure to cyclical end markets, and have executed the transformational integration of Nexeo
into Univar Solutions’ DNA. This management team will continue to lead our organization following the
transaction.

**The Transactions**

On March 13, 2023, Univar entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with
Windsor Parent, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Parent”), and Windsor Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates
of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo”) and Platinum Falcon B 2018 RSC
Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (“ADIA”). Holdings and the
Issuer are wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent and Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of

17


-----

the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Univar (the “Merger”), with Univar surviving the
Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective
Time”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Univar, par value $0.01 per share (a “Share”) (other
than (a) certain Shares owned by (x) Univar as treasury stock or otherwise, (y) Holdings or Merger Sub or (z) any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings (other than Merger Sub) or of Univar, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
which are held by stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal for such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and have complied with and have not waived, effectively
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal under Delaware law with respect to such Shares, and (c) Shares covered by
share awards granted subject to any time-based vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions), will be automatically
converted into the right to receive $36.15 per Share in cash without interest. In accordance with the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub may acquire certain Canadian assets of Univar on the day prior to the Merger Closing Date.

The issuance of the notes may occur prior to the completion of the Merger. If so, on the issue date, pending
consummation of the Merger, the gross proceeds from this offering of the notes will be deposited into a segregated
escrow account pledged on a first-priority basis as collateral for the benefit of holders of the notes (with J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., acting as escrow agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement) together with an additional amount of
cash or cash equivalents in an amount that, when taken together with the rights to receive any cash or cash
equivalents under one or more letters of credit or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters (as defined below),
would equal the amount of interest that would accrue on the notes to, but excluding, July 31, 2023. If neither the
Release Date nor a special mandatory redemption has previously occurred, no later than three business days prior to
the end of each month (commencing July 31, 2023) and subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Issuer
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) in the escrow account an additional amount of cash or cash equivalents equal
to the interest that would accrue on the notes to, but excluding, the last day of the next succeeding month. At the
Issuer’s option, funds managed by affiliates or certain investment affiliates of the Sponsor will (i) enter into equity
commitment letters pursuant to which they will, among other things, agree to contribute cash or cash equivalents
directly or indirectly to the Issuer in an amount equal to all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on the
notes until the special mandatory redemption date in the event that the special mandatory redemption date occurs
(each, a “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letter” and, collectively, the “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment
Letters”) and/or (ii) in lieu of all or a portion of such amount, deposit or cause to be deposited in the escrow account
an amount of cash and/or cash equivalents (either in the form of cash or letters of credit). The Sponsor Escrow
Interest Commitment Letters, if applicable, will automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (x) the
completion of the special mandatory redemption and (y) the date of satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (as
described below).

Upon delivery to the escrow agent and the Trustee of an officer’s certificate instructing the escrow agent to
release the escrowed funds and certifying that prior to or substantially concurrently with the release of funds from
escrow to us (i) the Merger will be consummated in all material respects as described above, (ii) the Credit Facilities
will be entered into and (iii) the Equity Contribution (as defined below) will be made in an aggregate amount
sufficient, when taken together with the escrowed funds, borrowings available under the Credit Facilities and cash
and cash equivalents of Univar, to consummate the Merger and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith
(collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”), the escrowed funds will be released to the Issuer. See “Description of
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In addition, if the Escrow Conditions are satisfied, a
deferred discount will be paid to the initial purchasers in connection with this offering.

If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to January 31, 2024 or such earlier date as the Issuer
determines in its sole discretion that the Escrow Conditions cannot be satisfied or the Issuer notifies the escrow
agent and the Trustee in writing that the Issuer will not pursue the consummation of the Merger and/or the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated (such earliest date, the “Escrow Termination Date”), the Issuer will be required to
redeem the notes no later than five business days thereafter at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the notes,
together with accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory
redemption. Escrowed funds would be released and applied to pay for any such redemption. See “Description of
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If the issuance of the notes occurs on the Merger
Closing Date, none of the escrow provisions described in this offering memorandum will be applicable, no proceeds
of this offering will be deposited into the escrow account and all such proceeds will be provided to the Issuer on the
issue date for use as described under “Use of Proceeds.”

18


-----

At or prior to the closing of the Merger, funds affiliated with or controlled by our Sponsor and certain coinvestors will directly or indirectly contribute an aggregate amount of approximately $3,727.9 million in cash
(which amount may be increased or decreased depending on the final amount of cash of Univar designated by Parent
to be used to fund a portion of the Merger consideration, the amount of fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions and the actual amount of cash to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross
currency swaps) in the form of equity to Parent, which amount will be indirectly contributed to the Issuer in the form
of common equity and used to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses. We refer to
this cash equity contribution as the “Equity Contribution.”

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into a credit agreement governing the five-year
$1,400.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”), $500.0 million of which
we expect to be drawn at the closing of the Merger, and a credit agreement governing the seven-year $2,300.0
million (equivalent) senior secured first lien term loan facility, comprised of a $1,750.0 million U.S. dollar tranche
and a $550.0 million (equivalent) euro tranche (the “Term Loan Facility” and, together with the ABL Facility, the
“Credit Facilities”). See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the Credit Facilities.

Univar intends to issue a conditional notice of redemption to redeem all $454.0 million of its outstanding
5.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Existing Notes”) on the Merger Closing Date at a redemption price equal to
102.563% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date. To the extent that the redemption does not occur on the Merger Closing Date, Univar expects to
satisfy and discharge its obligations under the Existing Notes, and the governing indenture, on the Merger Closing
Date by depositing with the trustee under such indenture funds sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price for
the Existing Notes, including all accrued and unpaid interest, on the scheduled redemption date. In connection with
the Merger, any outstanding borrowings under Univar’s existing term loan credit facilities and asset-based revolving
credit facilities (the “Existing Facilities”) will be repaid and the commitments thereunder will be terminated.

Throughout this offering memorandum, we refer to the Merger, the Equity Contribution, the entry into, and
borrowings under, the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the redemption of Univar’s outstanding Existing
Notes (including any related satisfaction and discharge), the repayment of the Existing Facilities and the termination
of the commitments thereunder, the consummation of this offering and, in each case, the use of proceeds thereof,
collectively, as the “Transactions.”

**Sources and Uses of Funds**

We intend to use the proceeds from the issuance of the notes, together with borrowings under the Credit
Facilities, the Equity Contribution and cash from the balance sheet of Univar, to fund the Transactions and to pay
related fees and expenses.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions,
assuming they occurred on March 31, 2023 and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. The actual
sources and uses of funds may vary from the estimated sources and uses of funds set forth below. The estimated
sources and uses of funds presented below should be read in conjunction with “—The Transactions,” “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility,

approximately $500.0 million of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger (in addition to
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date of the
Transactions). Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March
31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date of the Transactions and
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date of the
Transactions, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility
as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility.

(2) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $2,300.0 million (equivalent) Term Loan

Facility, comprised of a $1,750.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and a $550.0 million (equivalent) euro tranche, all
of which will be drawn at the closing of the Merger. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description
of the Term Loan Facility.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby and does not reflect the initial purchasers’

discounts and commissions, original issue discount on the notes or estimated fees and expenses related to this
offering. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay
related fees and expenses. If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Termination
Date, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

(4) Represents amounts invested directly or indirectly in equity securities of Parent by funds affiliated with or

controlled by the Sponsor and certain co-investors, which will be contributed as cash by Parent indirectly to the
Issuer. The proceeds from the Equity Contribution will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay
related fees and expenses. The actual amount of the cash Equity Contribution will depend on certain factors,
such as fees and expenses, cash balances of Univar on the Merger Closing Date and the actual amount of cash
to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency swaps. For more information regarding
the equity ownership of Parent upon the closing of the Transactions, see “—The Transactions,” “—Corporate
Structure” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”

(5) Represents the estimated cash to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency swaps in

connection with the Merger based on the fair value of the swaps as of March 31, 2023.

(6) The actual amount of cash available as a source of funds will depend on, among other things, the cash balances

of Univar as of the Merger Closing Date.

(7) Represents the estimated aggregate Merger consideration payable to equity holders of Univar on the Merger

Closing Date.

(8) Represents the $454.0 million aggregate principal amount of Univar’s outstanding Existing Notes to be

redeemed at a redemption price equal to 102.563% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes. The final
redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest from June 1, 2023 to, but excluding, the

20

redemption date, which is not included in the amount set forth above. The final redemption price will vary
based on the date of redemption and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes to the date of
redemption. See “—The Transactions.”

(9) As of March 31, 2023, there was approximately $1,979.5 million outstanding under Univar’s Existing Facilities,

which will be repaid in full and terminated concurrently with the consummation of the Merger.

(10) Represents estimated transaction fees and expenses of approximately $438.0 million. Estimated transaction fees

and expenses include costs associated with the financing and other transactional fees and expenses, including
legal, accounting and other professional fees.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under Univar’s Existing
Facilities, holders of the Existing Notes and/or holders of Univar’s common stock and therefore will receive a
portion of the gross proceeds of the notes offered hereby. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the Credit Facilities and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith, and have, from time to time, performed various commercial and investment
banking and financial advisory services for us. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, is acting as Escrow Agent in connection with the Transactions and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith. Apollo Global Securities, LLC is an affiliate of Apollo, our Sponsor, and will
receive a portion of the gross spread as an initial purchaser in the sale of the notes offered hereby. See “Plan of
Distribution” for more details.

**Corporate Structure**

The diagram below sets forth a simplified version of our organizational structure and our principal
indebtedness after the completion of the Transactions. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does
not represent all legal entities affiliated with, or all obligations of, the Issuer.

21


-----

(1) Holdings will guarantee the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility on a limited recourse basis but will not guarantee the

notes. In addition, Holdings will pledge all of the equity interests it directly holds of the Issuer to secure the Term Loan
Facility on a first-priority basis and the ABL Facility on a second-priority basis. The equity interests of the Issuer held by
Holdings will not secure the notes.

(2) As of the closing date of the Transactions, the Issuer will pledge substantially all of its material owned assets, other than the

ABL Priority Collateral and subject to certain exceptions (the “Notes Priority Collateral”), as collateral for the Term Loan
Facility and the notes on a first-priority basis and for the ABL Facility on a second-priority basis. The Issuer will pledge
substantially all of its inventory and accounts receivable and related assets, subject to certain exceptions (the “ABL Priority
Collateral”), as collateral for the ABL Facility on a first-priority basis and for the Term Loan Facility and the notes on a
second-priority basis. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

(3) As of the closing of the Transactions, we expect that approximately $500.0 million will be drawn and outstanding under the

ABL Facility. Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023,
approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of
credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of borrowings
available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility.

(4)  At the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Univar, with Univar surviving the Merger as a

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

22


-----

(5) As of the closing date of the Transactions, all wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than

domestic subsidiaries that are subsidiaries of foreign subsidiaries), including Univar, will guarantee the Credit Facilities and
the notes. In addition, all such subsidiary guarantors will pledge substantially all of their material owned assets, other than
ABL Priority Collateral, subject to certain exceptions (the “Notes Priority Collateral”), as collateral for the Term Loan
Facility and the notes on a first-priority basis and for the ABL Facility on a second-priority basis. The subsidiary guarantors
will pledge substantially all of their inventory and accounts receivable and related assets, subject to certain exceptions (the
“ABL Priority Collateral”), as collateral for the ABL Facility on a first-priority basis and for the Term Loan Facility and the
notes on a second-priority basis. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

(6) Non-guarantor subsidiaries consist of non-wholly owned subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries (and domestic subsidiaries that

are subsidiaries of foreign subsidiaries) and certain other subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
held approximately 36% of our consolidated assets and during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries generated approximately 34% of our total revenues and approximately 34% of our Reported Adjusted EBITDA.
As of March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had approximately $387.0 million of outstanding indebtedness,
excluding intercompany obligations. Certain foreign subsidiaries will be obligors under the ABL Facility but will not
guarantee the Term Loan Facility or the notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**

**Mandatory Redemption .....................** The issuance of the notes may occur prior to the completion of the

Merger. If so, on the issue date, pending consummation of the
Merger, the gross proceeds from this offering will be deposited into a
segregated escrow account pledged on a first-priority basis as
collateral for the benefit of holders of the notes (with J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., acting as escrow agent, pursuant to an escrow
agreement) together with an additional amount of cash or cash
equivalents in an amount that, when taken together with the rights to
receive any cash or cash equivalents under one or more letters of
credit or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters, would equal
the amount of interest that would accrue on the notes to, but
excluding, July 31, 2023. If neither the Release Date nor a special
mandatory redemption has previously occurred, no later than three
business days prior to the end of each month (commencing July 31,
2023) and subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Issuer
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) in the escrow account an
additional amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to the interest
that would accrue on the notes to, but excluding, the last day of the
next succeeding month. At the Issuer’s option, funds managed by
affiliates or certain investment affiliates of the Sponsor will (i) enter
into the Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters pursuant to
which they will, among other things, agree to contribute cash or cash
equivalents directly or indirectly to the Issuer in an amount equal to
all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes until
the special mandatory redemption date in the event that the special
mandatory redemption date occurs and/or (ii) in lieu of all or a
portion of such amount, deposit or cause to be deposited in the
escrow amount an amount of cash and/or cash equivalents (either in
the form of cash or letters of credit). The Sponsor Escrow Interest
Commitment Letters, if applicable, will automatically terminate on
the earliest to occur of (x) the completion of the special mandatory
redemption and (y) the date of satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions.
Upon delivery to the escrow agent and the Trustee of an officer’s
certificate instructing the escrow agent to release the escrowed funds
and certifying as to the Escrow Conditions, the escrowed funds will
be released to the Issuer.

If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow
Termination Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem the notes no

24


-----

later than five business days thereafter at a price equal to 100% of the
issue price of the notes, together with interest accrued and unpaid on
the notes, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Escrowed
funds would be released and applied to pay for any such
redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.” If the issuance of the notes occurs on the
Merger Closing Date, none of the escrow provisions described in this
offering memorandum will be applicable, no proceeds of this offering
will be deposited into the escrow account and all such proceeds will
be provided to the Issuer on the issue date for use as described under
“Use of Proceeds.”

**Guarantees ..............................................** Prior to the Release Date, the notes will not be guaranteed by any of
the Issuer’s subsidiaries. From and after the Release Date, the Issuer’s
obligations under the notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Issuer’s present and future
direct or indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that
guarantee the Term Loan Facility. See “Description of Notes—
Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**Ranking ...................................................** The notes and the related guarantees will be senior secured
obligations and, from and after the Release Date, will:

                      - be secured by the collateral as set forth under “Description
of Notes—Security”;

                      - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the subsidiary
guarantors;

                      - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer and the
subsidiary guarantors that are, by their terms, expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the notes;

                      - be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors, to
the extent of the value of the collateral securing the notes;

                      - be effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors secured by a
junior-priority lien on the collateral, to the extent of the
value of the collateral securing the notes;

                      - be effectively senior to all indebtedness of the Issuer and the
subsidiary guarantors under the ABL Facility, to the extent
of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral;

                      - be effectively junior to all indebtedness of the Issuer and the
subsidiary guarantors under the ABL Facility, to the extent
of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral;

                      - be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer
and the subsidiary guarantors that is secured by assets or
properties not constituting collateral securing the notes, to
the extent of the value of such assets and properties; and

                      - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the notes,
including the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries that are obligors
under the ABL Facility.

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, the notes would have ranked equally to $2,300.0 of
senior secured indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Further,

25


-----

all amounts drawn under the ABL Facility will be secured on a firstpriority basis by the ABL Priority Collateral and on a second-priority
basis by the Notes Priority Collateral. As of March 31, 2023, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have
had approximately $677.9 million available for borrowing under the
$1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing
base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million, approximately
$500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be
outstanding as of the closing date of the Transactions). Certain
hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements that are
entered into with the lenders under the ABL Facility will be secured
by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility.

As of March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries held
approximately 36% of our consolidated assets and during the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
generated approximately 34% of our total revenues and
approximately 34% of our Reported Adjusted EBITDA. As of March
31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had approximately $387.0
million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany
obligations. Certain foreign subsidiaries will be obligors under the
ABL Facility but will not guarantee the Term Loan Facility or the
notes.

**Security ....................................................** From and after the Release Date, the notes and the related guarantees
will be secured by first-priority security interests in the “Notes
Priority Collateral” (which generally includes most of the Issuer’s and
subsidiary guarantors’ assets other than the ABL Priority Collateral)
and by second-priority security interests in the “ABL Priority
Collateral” (which generally includes most of the Issuer’s and
subsidiary guarantors’ inventory and accounts receivable and related
assets), in each case subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.
For more information, see “Description of Notes—Security.”

**Intercreditor Agreements ......................** The security granted in the ABL Priority Collateral to secure the
notes and the Term Loan Facility on a second-priority basis will also
be granted to secure, on a first-priority basis, indebtedness under the
ABL Facility, and the security granted in the Notes Priority Collateral
to secure the notes and the Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis
will also be granted to secure, on a second-priority basis,
indebtedness under the ABL Facility. In addition, the indenture
governing the notes will permit us to secure additional indebtedness
with liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and the Notes Priority
Collateral under certain circumstances.

The agent for the ABL Facility, the agent for the Term Loan Facility,
the Trustee and the collateral agent for the notes will enter into an
intercreditor agreement (the “ABL Intercreditor Agreement”) to set
forth the relative priorities of the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral
and the Notes Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility, the Term
Loan Facility and the notes. Pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, the lenders under the ABL Facility and the holders of
certain debt (including certain hedging, cash management and bank
product obligations) will receive priority treatment with respect to the
proceeds of an enforcement of the security interest in or other
recoveries from the ABL Priority Collateral. See “Description of
Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreements—ABL Intercreditor

26


-----

Agreement.”

In addition, the administrative agent for the Term Loan Facility, the
Trustee and the collateral agent for the notes and the Term Loan
Facility will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement”) governing the relationship between the
lenders under the Term Loan Facility and holders of the notes as well
as holders of any other indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis
with the notes and the Term Loan Facility. See “Description of
Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreements—First Lien Intercreditor

the applicable redemption date plus the applicable “make-whole”
premium.

On or after               , 2026, we may redeem some or all of
the notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to (but excluding) the applicable redemption date.

Additionally, prior to               , 2026, we may redeem up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes in an amount
not to exceed the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the
redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the applicable
redemption date.

indenture governing the notes, the holders of the notes will have the
right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, to (but excluding) the date of purchase.

See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

**Asset Sales ...............................................** If we sell certain assets, under certain circumstances we may be
required to offer to purchase the notes as described under
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.”

**Certain Covenants ..................................** The indenture governing the notes, among other things, limits our

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA**

Set forth below is the summary historical consolidated financial and other operating data of Univar for the
periods and as of the dates indicated. We have derived the consolidated statements of operations data and cash flows
data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of
December 31, 2021 and 2022 from Univar’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum. We have derived the condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data
for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023 and the condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of March
31, 2023 from Univar’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. We have derived the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2020 and the condensed
consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2022 from Univar’s audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements, respectively, not included in this offering memorandum. The results of operations for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the full year or any future
period.

The table below also includes our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations
data, giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022. The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data has been prepared as if the Transactions occurred on March 31,
2023. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are
reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information herein has been adjusted to
depict the accounting for the Transactions, which reflect the application of the accounting required by GAAP,
linking the effects of the Transactions to the historical consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of
management, the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data includes all adjustments necessary to
present a fair statement of the pro formal financial information. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of
operations or financial position actually would have been if the Transactions had occurred at any other date, and
such data does not purport to project our results of operations for any future period.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.
The pro forma information presented, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary
estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this
offering memorandum and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes
available. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary
asset and liability valuations. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon closing of the
Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and the actual balance of our
net assets on the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the
differences may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of the purchase price, which could
affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial data, including a change to goodwill and net income.

The summary historical and pro forma condensed consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction
with “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical consolidated financial statements of
Univar and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used to assess operating performance is defined as net earnings (loss) plus interest and

financing costs, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Reported Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods is
consistent with the basis of presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in Univar’s public filings and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used to
assess operating performance, is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items and other adjustments. Adjusted
EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum for historical periods is not consistent with the basis of presentation of
Adjusted EBITDA in Univar’s prior public filings, but rather reflects a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA that will be
permitted by the indenture, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the Term
Loan Facility. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the items set forth below. Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization is Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA including the impact of the supply chain
disruption and destocking in 2022 that is excluded from the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Each of the above described EBITDA-based measures is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an
alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of
liquidity. Additionally, each such measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flows available for management’s
discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service
requirements. Such measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of such measures in
isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. The Issuer compensates for the limitations of using nonGAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the
factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations,
these EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See “Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Information.”

The Issuer believes EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because EBITDA excludes the results of decisions that are
outside the control of operating management and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term
strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. In
addition, EBITDA provides more comparability between the historical operating results and pro forma operating results that
reflect the acquisition method of accounting and the new capital structure.

The Issuer believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Reported Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization are
appropriate to provide additional information to investors in our debt about certain material non-cash items and about certain
items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future as well as others. The Issuer expects to use Pro Forma

32


-----

Adjusted EBITDA internally to make operating decisions and believes this measure is helpful to investors because it allows
period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results. The information can also be used to perform
trend analyses and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted. Finally, the Issuer believes
such information provides a higher degree of transparency. The indenture, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility,
the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and other debt agreements will permit us to exclude other charges
and expenses and make other or different adjustments in calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. See “Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Information” and “Description of Notes.”

-----

(a) Represents an adjustment to exclude various nonrecurring and non-cash expenses (income), including (i) third-party

expenses related to acquisition and integration activities, including expenses for deal advisors, legal counsel,
investment bankers, and other consultant fees, (ii) restructuring charges primarily related to headcount and facility
footprint rationalizations intended to streamline the Company’s cost structure and operations, (iii) non-cash (gain) loss
on the sale of property, plant and equipment, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and (v) a one-time
charge to establish an accrual for the withdrawal liability related to the Company’s multi-employer pension plan.

(b) Represents an adjustment to exclude non-operating charges (income), including (i) non-operating retirement benefits,

as well as pension mark to market and curtailment and settlement (gains) losses, (ii) gains and losses associated with
undesignated foreign currency derivatives and swaps, (iii) revaluation gains and losses on the Company’s loans, (iv)
transactional foreign exchange gains and (losses), (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (vi) debt refinancing costs,
and (vii) the fair value revaluation of the Company’s warrants.

(c) Represents an adjustment to remove non-cash impairment charges from adjusted earnings.

(d) Represents an adjustment to exclude the loss (gain) associated with the sale of the Canada Agriculture Services

business in 2020 and the sale of the Distrupol business in 2021.

(e) Represents an adjustment to remove a one-time charge incurred related to a change in treatment of Brazilian value
added taxes (“VAT”).

(f) Represents the estimated management fee payable to an affiliate of Apollo commencing after the close of the Merger.

(g) Represents an adjustment to include the Company’s transactional realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and

(losses).

(h) Represents an adjustment to present the Company’s rent expense to actual cash rent payments made per the lease

agreements.

(i) Represents an adjustment to (i) remove the net income from unconsolidated joint ventures reported under the equity

method of accounting and (ii) include cash dividends received from the unconsolidated joint ventures.

(j) Represents an adjustment to remove other non-recurring items such as (i) sublease income, and (ii) an environmental

provision that was recorded in 2021, with an equal and offsetting insurance recovery receivable recorded in 2022.

(k) Represents an adjustment to normalize the supply chain disruption and destocking impact on the Company’s operations

in 2022. This adjustment attempts to normalize temporary pricing surges within the first three quarters of 2022, as well
as the earnings impact of destocking in the fourth quarter of 2022. See below for further detail:

i. During 2022, market prices of certain product categories increased significantly due to low overall supply in the
market. Since the Company was able to maintain its supply during the period, the Company benefited from the
temporary increase in pricing. This adjustment removes the net earnings impact of this significant pricing event
net of related sales bonuses of $144.5 million.
ii. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the industry experienced a significant destocking event as a result of supply
chain disruptions. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company experienced a significant decrease in
volume. This adjustment normalizes fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA by including the estimated earnings of $25.7
million that the Company would have earned absent this industry wide destocking event.

(l) Represents additional estimated operational cost savings over a period of time through various initiatives such as (i)

approximately $4 million of savings as a result of warehouse operations improvement and consolidation, (ii)
approximately $7 million of savings driven by fleet and logistics improvements, (iii) approximately $39 million of
organizational and general and administrative expense optimization, including public company cost savings as the
Company will be taken private, (iv) approximately $14 million of savings driven by direct and indirect procurement
optimization, and (v) approximately $11 million of savings as a result of go to market channel optimization. These
estimates are based on the current estimates of the Issuer, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Issuer to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by estimates. To achieve this level of annual cost
savings, we expect to incur approximately $37 million of one-time costs (approximately $25 million in 2024 and $12
million in 2025). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize any or all of our
estimated cost savings and synergies, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.”

34


-----

(m) Removes the EBITDA associated with the Company’s divestiture of the Russia Joint Venture.

(n) Represents an adjustment to include the pre-acquisition EBITDA of businesses that the Company acquired or signed a

purchase agreement to acquire on a pro forma basis, including Vicom, Kale Kimya, and Chemsol.

(o) Represents estimated pro forma synergies associated with the Company’s acquisitions of Kale Kimya and Chemsol.

This adjustment is primarily related to (i) margin and volume expansion from leveraging suppliers and new supplier
authorizations, net of estimated incremental operating expenses to service the increased volume, and (ii) cost savings
through removal of duplicative operating expenses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may
not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings and synergies, which would have a negative effect on our results of
operations.”

(2) Working Capital is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities as presented in the historical and pro forma

condensed consolidated balance sheet.

(3) The ratio of net first-lien debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate principal

amount of indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the notes, net of expected unrestricted cash and
cash equivalents of approximately $100.0 million as of the closing date of the Transactions, by Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA.

(4) The ratio of net total debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate principal amount

of indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the notes, net of expected unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents of approximately $100.0 million as of the closing date of the Transactions, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

(5) The ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by dividing Pro Forma Adjusted

EBITDA by pro forma cash interest expense. Pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by adjusting total cash interest
expense to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the notes, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and the repayment of the
Existing Facilities and redemption of the Existing Notes. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Data” for a discussion of the assumptions used when calculating pro forma cash interest expense. Actual cash interest
expense will primarily depend upon the interest rates payable on the notes and the Credit Facilities and excludes non-cash
amortization of debt issuance costs.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in_
_this offering memorandum, before purchasing any notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely_
_affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the risks described below are not the_
_only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those that we currently view_
_to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of_
_operations. In any such case, you may lose all or a part of your investment in the notes._

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, some or all of which may not be_**
**_satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all._**

Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including: antitrust clearance in
Brazil, Canada, China, European Union, Mexico, Turkey and the United States; foreign direct investment approval
in France, Italy and Spain; and approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). As
of the date hereof, the parties have received antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union,
Mexico and the United States, and foreign direct investment approval in Italy. We can provide no assurance that all
conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending Merger could be
exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.

Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifications) and compliance in all material respects
with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger, including,
with respect to Univar, covenants to conduct its business in the ordinary course and to not engage in certain kinds of
material transactions prior to closing. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed or that, if
completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.

If the Merger is not consummated on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum, we
will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to the initial issue price of the
notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date up to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not receive your expected return on the notes and may not
be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if
you purchase the notes at a price greater than the initial issue price of the notes, you may suffer a loss on your
investment. See “—Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—In the event that the Merger is not consummated on
or prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Merger is terminated at any time prior thereto, or other conditions to
the release of the escrowed proceeds of this offering are not satisfied, the notes will be subject to special mandatory
redemption and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the notes.”

**_Univar will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may_**
**_make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners._**

Our efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty
surrounding, Univar’s business, which may materially adversely affect Univar’s results of operation and its business.
Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect Univar’s ability to recruit prospective employees
or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger
is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. A substantial
amount of Univar management’s and employees’ attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger
and thus is being diverted from Univar’s day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to Univar’s future could adversely
affect its business and its relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers
and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with Univar, or seek to change existing business
relationships with Univar. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect
Univar’s revenue, earnings and financial condition. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be
exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.


-----

**_Significant costs and significant indebtedness will be incurred in connection with the consummation of the_**
**_Transactions, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs._**

We expect to incur significant costs in connection with completing the Transactions. These costs include
the redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest in connection with the redemption of the Existing Notes and
other financing fees, advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees in connection with the
Transactions, and may include costs for employee retention, redeployment, relocation or severance and increased
fees and expenses beyond our current estimates, including due to delays in consummating the Transactions. See
“Summary—Sources and Uses of Funds” and “Use of Proceeds.”

While we expect to incur a significant amount of transaction fees and other one-time costs related to the
consummation of the Transactions, additional unanticipated costs may yet be incurred. In addition, we expect to
incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with our business initiatives, which cannot be estimated accurately
at this time.

**_The announcement and pendency of the Merger could adversely impact Univar’s business, financial condition,_**
**_and results of operations._**

Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on Univar’s employees, customers and other parties may have
an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations regardless of whether the Merger is
completed. These risks to Univar’s business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in
the completion of the Merger:

    - the impairment of Univar’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate its employees, including key
personnel;

    - the diversion of significant management time and resources toward the completion of the Merger;

    - difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners;

    - delays or deferments of certain business decisions by Univar’s customers, suppliers, and other business
partners;

    - the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to Univar’s
business because the Merger Agreement requires Univar to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its
business in the ordinary course and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business
organization intact and to maintain existing relations with key customers, suppliers, lenders, partners,
officers, employees, governmental entities and other third parties with whom Univar and its
subsidiaries have significant business relationships or regulatory relationships and to not engage in
certain types of transactions prior to the completion of the Merger;

    - litigation relating to the Merger and the costs related thereto; and

    - the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction
costs in connection with the Merger.

**_We do not currently control Univar and will not control Univar until the completion of the Merger._**

We do not currently control Univar and will not control Univar until the completion of the Merger. Until
that time, we cannot assure you that Univar will be operated in the same way that it would be operated under our
control. The covenants in the indenture governing the notes will not apply to Univar until the consummation of the
Merger.


-----

**_The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data presented in this offering memorandum may not_**
**_be a reliable indicator of our future results._**

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data included in this offering memorandum is
derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Univar included in this offering memorandum and is
based on certain assumptions and estimates. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data may
not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial position would have been had the Transactions
occurred during the periods presented or what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in
the future. Certain of the information in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data is based on
preliminary estimates of fair value, which estimates will be adjusted based upon valuations that must be performed
as of the closing date. Any such adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value could be material. See
“Summary,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and the historical financial statements and the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings and synergies, which would have a negative effect on_**
**_our results of operations._**

Following the Merger, we expect to realize certain cost savings and synergies, including through various
initiatives such as (i) warehouse operations improvement and consolidation, (ii) fleet and logistics improvements,
(iii) organizational restructuring and general and administrative expense optimization, (iv) public company cost
savings as the Company will be taken private, (v) direct and indirect procurement optimization, and (vi) go to
market channel optimization. Any cost savings or synergies that we realize may differ materially from our estimates.
The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. This information is speculative in
nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the estimated cost savings and synergies
may not materialize or may vary from actual results. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings and synergies
associated with the adjustments included or permitted by the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit
agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities to be included when calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and
customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. We will be required to
make significant cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings and synergies, and these cash costs are not reflected
in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We currently expect to incur approximately $37 million of one-time costs to
achieve the $75 million of estimated cost savings and synergies included in the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures will not be higher than we anticipate, and we may need
to incur incremental costs to achieve such cost savings and synergies or additional cost savings or synergies. In
addition, we will not fully realize such cost savings or synergies within 12 to 18 months of the completion of the
Merger, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings and synergies. Our ability to realize these
anticipated savings and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on
the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results.

In addition, any cost savings or synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in
revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For example, reducing
sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to disruption of our operations,
loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards,
controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. Our expected cost savings and
synergies are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. Our calculation of Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for estimated cost savings and synergies expected to be implemented.
Although we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, investors should not place undue reliance
upon the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA given how it is calculated and the possibility that the
underlying estimates and assumptions may ultimately not reflect actual results. There can be no assurances that we
will achieve the cost savings and synergies that we or our independent third party consultant have identified within
the time frames that we or our independent third party consultant expect or at all. If our cost savings and synergies
are less than our estimates or our cost savings initiatives adversely affect our business or cost more or take longer to


-----

implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results could be lower than we
anticipate. As a result, our future performance may differ significantly from the pro forma condensed consolidated
financial data of the Issuer set forth herein.

Further, no third party, including our independent auditor or any of the initial purchasers, has performed
any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these estimated cost savings or synergies, or their
respective achievability. In addition, the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will
govern the Credit Facilities permit us to adjust EBITDA for items that would not meet the standards for inclusion in
pro forma financial statements under accounting regulations and the other SEC rules. Some of these adjustments
may be considered to be too speculative to merit adjustment under accounting regulations; however, the indenture
that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities would permit such
adjustments for purposes of determining Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of these adjustments, we may be
able to incur more debt or pay dividends or make other restricted payments in greater amounts than would otherwise
be permitted without such adjustments.

The future performance of the Issuer may differ significantly from the anticipated performance of the Issuer
set forth herein. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data.”

**_We are involved in litigation relating to the Merger that could divert management’s attention and harm our_**
**_business._**

We are a defendant in lawsuits related to the Merger. These suits generally allege, among other things, that
the directors of Univar violated certain disclosure obligations in connection with disclosures made to Univar
stockholders concerning the Merger and/or ran an inadequate sale process. The complaints seek, among other things,
injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, declaratory relief finding breach of fiduciary duties
and/or violation of the Exchange Act claims, rescissory damages or rescission in the event of consummation of the
Merger, direction mandating the filing of a new disclosure document, and certain fees and expenses. Defense of
these suits may be expensive and may divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect
our business.

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_We are affected by general economic conditions, particularly fluctuations in industrial production and_**
**_consumption, and an economic downturn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

We sell chemicals that are used in manufacturing processes and as components of or ingredients in other
products. Our sales are correlated with and affected by fluctuations in the levels of industrial production,
manufacturing output and general economic activity. Producers of commodity and specialty chemicals are likely to
reduce their output in periods of significant contraction in industrial and consumer demand, while demand for the
products we distribute depends largely on trends in demand in the end markets our customers serve. A majority of
our sales are in North America and Europe and our business is therefore susceptible to downturns in those
economies, as well as, to a lesser extent, the economies in the rest of the world.

Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our products and services, could decline as a result of a
large number of factors outside our control, including the impact of pandemics and other public-health emergencies,
economic recessions, reduced customer demand (whether due to changes in production processes, consumer
preferences, the industries in which the customer operates, laws and regulations affecting the chemicals industry and
the manner in which they are enforced, or other factors), inflation, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates, and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. For
example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused growth in certain of our end markets, such as in homecare and industrial
cleaning and pharmaceuticals, while other end markets, such as the upstream refining market, were materially and
adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize our growth goals and targeted gross
profit margins.


-----

General economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers,
could affect overall demand for chemicals. Any overall decline in the demand for chemicals could significantly
reduce our sales and profitability. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we would face increased credit
risk. In addition, volatility and disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our sales and results of
operations by limiting our customers’ ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain or expand their
own operations.

A historical feature of past economic weakness has been significant destocking of inventories, including
inventories of chemicals used in industrial and manufacturing processes. It is possible that an improvement in our
net sales in a particular period may be attributable in part to restocking of inventories by our customers and represent
a level of sales or sales growth that will not be sustainable over the longer term. Further economic weakness could
lead to insolvencies among our customers or producers, as well as among financial institutions that are
counterparties on financial instruments or accounts that we hold. Any of these developments could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Significant changes in the business strategies of producers or in the operations of our customers could adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Significant changes in the business strategies of producers could disrupt our supply. Large chemical
manufacturers may elect to sell certain products (or products in certain regions) directly to customers or utilize
digital marketplaces, bypassing distributors such as us. While we do not believe that our results depend materially
on access to any individual producer’s products, a reversal of the trend toward more active use of distributors would
likely result in increasing margin pressure or products becoming unavailable to us.

In addition, unpredictable events may have a significant impact on the industries in which many of our
customers operate, reducing demand for products that we normally distribute in significant volumes. Significant
disruptions of supply and disruptions in customer industries could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully._**

The chemical and ingredient distribution and services industry is highly competitive. Chemicals can be
purchased from a variety of sources, including traders, brokers, wholesalers and other distributors, as well as directly
from producers. Many of the products we distribute or finish are essentially fungible with products offered by our
competitors, including emerging competitors. The competitive pressure we face is particularly strong in sectors and
markets where local competitors have strong positions or where new competitors can easily enter. Increased
competition from distributors of products similar to or competitive with ours could result in price reductions,
reduced margins and a loss of market share.

We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. We must
also compete with smaller companies that have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases. In
certain countries, some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have
greater resources within those countries than we do.

**_Consolidation of our competitors in the markets in which we operate could place us at a competitive disadvantage_**
**_and reduce our profitability._**

We operate in an industry that is highly fragmented on a global scale, but in which there has been a trend
toward consolidation in recent years. Consolidation of our competitors may also further enhance their financial
position, provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and
allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively
compete for customers. This may jeopardize the strength of our positions in one or more of the markets in which we
operate and any advantages we currently enjoy due to the comparative scale of our operations. Losing some of those
advantages could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our growth
potential.


-----

**_Disruption of our supply chain due to various acute or severe causes could have an adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In coordination with our suppliers, our ability to move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage
or disruption to our collective supply or distribution capabilities resulting directly or indirectly from pandemics and
other public-health emergencies, labor shortages, border closures, natural disasters, weather and physical climate
change related events, lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, global trade flow disruption,
increased airport and shipping port congestion, climate change, plant downtime (whether our own or others’), power
outages, explosions, information technology system and/or network disruptions, terrorism, strikes or other labor
unrest, or other reasons could seriously harm our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and
suppliers. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these
events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could have a negative impact on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Some of the foregoing examples are hypothetical, but others have been or are being experienced by the
Company. For example, during 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, weather events and supply constraints
impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our operations. The combination of supplier shut-downs, port
congestion, acute pandemic recovery demand and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have resulted in sustained supply
chain constraints, product shortages and chemical price inflation. In some instances, we have placed certain of our
products on allocation due to limited supplies.

**_The prices and costs of the products we purchase may be subject to large and significant price increases. We_**
**_might not be able to pass such cost increases through to our customers. We could experience financial losses if_**
**_our inventories of one or more chemicals exceed our sales and the price of those chemicals decreases_**
**_significantly while in our inventories or if our inventories fall short of our sales and the purchase price of those_**
**_chemicals increases significantly._**

We purchase and sell a wide variety of chemicals, the price and availability of which may fluctuate, and
may be subject to large and significant price increases. For example, ongoing shortages across a range of chemicals
and ingredients have generally led to fluctuations in chemical prices globally. Many of our contracts with producers
include chemical prices that are not fixed or are tied to an index, which allows our producers to change the prices of
the chemicals we purchase as the price of the chemicals fluctuates in the market. Changes in chemical prices affect
our net sales and cost of goods sold, as well as our working capital requirements, levels of debt and financing costs.
We might not always be able to reflect increases in our chemical costs, transportation costs and other costs in our
own pricing. Any inability to pass cost increases onto customers may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In order to meet customer demand, we typically maintain significant inventories, and we are therefore
subject to a number of risks associated with our inventory levels, including the following:

    - declines in the prices of chemicals that are held by us;

    - the need to maintain a significant inventory of chemicals that may be in limited supply and therefore
difficult to procure;

    - buying chemicals in bulk for the best pricing and thereby holding excess inventory;

    - responding to the fluctuating demand for chemicals;

    - cancellation of customer orders; and

    - responding to customer requests for rapid delivery.

In order to manage our inventories successfully, we must estimate demand from our customers and
purchase chemicals that substantially correspond to that demand. If we overestimate demand and purchase too much


-----

of a particular chemical, we face a risk that the price of that chemical will fall, leaving us with inventory that we
cannot sell profitably or have to write down such inventory from its recorded value. If we underestimate demand and
purchase insufficient quantities of a particular chemical and prices of that chemical rise, we could be forced to
purchase that chemical at a higher price and forego profitability in order to meet customer demand. Our business,
financial condition and results of operations could suffer a material adverse effect if either or both of these situations
occur frequently or in large volumes.

**_We require significant working capital, and we expect our working capital needs to increase in the future, which_**
**_could result in having lower cash available for, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisition_**
**_financing._**

We require significant working capital to purchase chemicals from chemical producers and distributors and
sell those chemicals efficiently and profitably to our customers. Our working capital needs may increase if the price
of products we purchase and inventory increase. Our working capital needs also increase at certain times of the year,
as our customers’ requirements for chemicals increase. We need inventory on hand to have product available to
ensure timely delivery to our customers. If our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance
our working capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may not be able to obtain chemicals to respond to
customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales.

In addition, the amount of working capital we require to run our business is expected to increase in the
future due to expansions in our business activities. Disruptions in our supply chain could also create the need to
invest additional working capital in on-hand inventory than in prior years. If our working capital needs increase, the
amount of free cash we have at our disposal to devote to other uses will decrease. A decrease in free cash could,
among other things, limit our flexibility, including our ability to make capital expenditures and to acquire suitable
acquisition targets that we have identified. If increases in our working capital occur and have the effect of decreasing
our free cash, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on transportation assets, some of which we do not own, in order to deliver products to our customers._**

Although we maintain a significant portfolio of owned and leased transportation assets, including trucks,
trailers and rail cars, we also rely on transportation and warehousing provided by third parties (including common
carriers and rail companies) to deliver products to our customers. Our access to third party transportation is not
guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport chemicals at economically attractive rates in certain circumstances,
particularly in cases of adverse market conditions or disruptions to transportation infrastructure. In addition, we
could face a challenge with attracting and retaining qualified drivers primarily due to intense market competition,
which may subject us to increased payments for driver compensation. If we are unable to continue to attract and
retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could face difficulty meeting customer orders or be forced to forego
business that would otherwise be available to us, which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to
maintain or grow our business. We are also subject to increased costs that we may not always be able to recover
from our customers, including fuel prices, as well as charges imposed by common carriers, leasing companies and
other third parties involved in transportation.

**_Accidents, safety failures, environmental damage, product quality issues, delivery failures or hazards and risks_**
**_related to our operations and the hazardous materials we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport or dispose_**
**_of could damage our reputation and result in substantial damages or remedial obligations._**

Our business depends to a significant extent on our customers’ and producers’ trust in our reputation for
reliability, quality, safety and environmental responsibility. Actual or alleged instances of safety deficiencies,
mistaken or incorrect deliveries, inferior product quality, exposure to hazardous materials resulting in illness, injury
or other harm to persons, property or natural resources, or of damage caused by us or our products, could damage
our reputation and lead to customers and producers curtailing the volume of business they do with us. Also, there
may be safety, personal injury or other environmental risks related to our products which are not known today. Any
of these events, outcomes or allegations could also subject us to substantial legal claims, and we could incur
substantial expenses, including legal fees and other costs, in defending such legal claims, which could materially
impact our financial position and results of operations.


-----

Actual or alleged accidents or other incidents at our facilities or that otherwise involve our personnel or
operations could also subject us to claims for damages by third parties. Because many of the chemicals that we
handle are dangerous, we are subject to the ongoing risk of hazards, including leaks, spills, releases, explosions and
fires, which may cause property damage, illness, physical injury or death. We sell products used in hydraulic
fracturing, a process that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into subsurface rock formations to release and
capture oil and natural gas. The use of such hydraulic fracturing fluids by our customers may result in releases that
could impact the environment and third parties. Several of our distribution facilities are located near, and our
transportation routes could take us through, high-density population centers. If any such events occur, whether
through our own fault, through preexisting conditions at our facilities, through the fault of a third party or through a
natural disaster, terrorist incident or other event outside our control, our reputation could be damaged significantly.
We could also become responsible, as a result of environmental or other laws or by court order, for substantial
monetary damages or expensive investigative or remedial obligations related to such events, including but not
limited to those resulting from third party lawsuits or environmental investigation and cleanup obligations on and
off-site. The amount of any costs, including fines, damages and/or investigative and remedial obligations, that we
may become obligated to pay under such circumstances could substantially exceed any insurance we have to cover
such losses.

Any of these risks, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business exposes us to significant risks, not all of which are covered by insurance._**

Because we are engaged in the blending, managing, handling, storing, selling, transporting and disposing of
chemicals, chemical waste products and other hazardous materials, product liability, health impacts, fire damage,
safety, cyber security and environmental risks are significant concerns for us. We are also exposed to present and
future chemical exposure claims by employees, contractors on our premises and other persons located nearby, as
well as related workers’ compensation claims. Although we carry insurance to protect us against many risks
involved in the conduct of our business, we do not insure against all such risks and the insurance we carry is subject
to limitations, including exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits. Due to the variable condition of the insurance
market, we have experienced and may experience in the future, increased deductible retention levels and increased
premiums. We also may be unable to obtain at commercially reasonable rates in the future adequate insurance
coverage for the risks we currently insure against, and certain risks are or could become completely uninsurable or
eligible for coverage only to a reduced extent. Increased insurance premiums or the occurrence of significant
uncovered losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in tax laws may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating_**
**_results._**

New income, sales, use, product or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be
enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further,
existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied
adversely to us. Recently enacted changes to the U.S. federal tax regime could impact our tax liability and cash tax
payments. Most notably, in July 2022 excise taxes were imposed on a number of commodity chemical products
impacting our overall costs.

Our businesses are subject to income taxation in the United States as well as internationally. The
Company’s operations are subject to multiple, and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations. Recently, many
countries have adopted, or are considering revisions to their existing tax laws based on recommendations issued by
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. These
changes could materially impact our tax liability because of our organizational structure and significant international
operations.


-----

**_We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions, ventures and strategic investments, some of which_**
**_may be significant in size and scope, which have involved in the past and will likely involve in the future_**
**_numerous risks. We may not be able to address these risks without substantial expense, delay or other operational_**
**_or financial problems._**

Acquisitions or investments have involved in the past and will likely involve in the future various risks,
such as:

    - integrating the technologies, operations and personnel of any acquired business;

    - the potential disruption of our ongoing business, including the diversion of management attention;

    - the possible inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or
investment;

    - customer attrition arising from preferences to maintain redundant sources of supply;

    - producer attrition arising from overlapping or competitive products;

    - assumption of contingent or unanticipated liabilities or regulatory liabilities;

    - dependence on the retention and performance of existing management and work force of acquired
businesses for the future performance of these businesses;

    - regulatory risks associated with acquired businesses (including the risk that we may be required for
regulatory reasons to dispose of a portion of our existing or acquired businesses); and

    - the risks inherent in entering geographic or product markets in which we have limited prior experience.

Future acquisitions and investments may need to be financed in part through additional financing from
banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or through other arrangements, and
could result in substantial cash expenditures. The necessary acquisition financing may not be available to us on
acceptable terms if and when required, particularly if our debt leverage levels make it difficult or impossible for us
to secure additional financing for acquisitions.

**_Our balance sheet includes significant goodwill and intangible assets, the impairment of which could affect our_**
**_future financial condition and results of operations._**

We carry significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, our
goodwill and intangible assets totaled $2,288.2 million and $167.0 million, respectively. At least annually, the
Company assesses goodwill for impairment. If testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value is
written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings. Weakened demand for a specific product line or
business could result in an impairment. Intangible assets are amortized for book purposes over their respective
useful lives and are tested for impairment if any event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that carrying
value may not be recoverable. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of
goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our Sponsor’s interests may conflict with or differ from our interests or interests of holders of the notes._**

Our Sponsor controls our ultimate parent company, which indirectly owns 100% of the Issuer’s equity. In
addition, representatives or designees of our Sponsor will initially comprise the majority of our ultimate parent
company’s directors. As a result, our Sponsor can control our ability to enter into significant corporate transactions
such as mergers, tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of our Sponsor and
its affiliates could conflict with or differ from our interests. For example, the concentration of ownership held by our
Sponsor could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger, takeover or other


-----

business combination which may otherwise be favorable for us. If we encounter financial difficulties or are unable
to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our Sponsor and certain of its affiliates as equity holders might
conflict with your interests as a holder of the notes. Our Sponsor may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions,
divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even
though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the notes.

Additionally, our Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete, directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor may also
pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. Any such investment may increase the potential for the conflicts of interest
discussed in this risk factor. So long as our Sponsor continues to indirectly control a significant amount of the equity
of our ultimate parent company, even if such amount is less than 50%, it will continue to be able to substantially
influence or effectively control our ability to enter into any corporate transactions. Following the closing of the
Merger, our equity securities will not be registered under the securities laws of the United States or in any other
jurisdiction and will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange and, consequently, we will not be subject to the
corporate governance requirements of U.S. securities authorities or to any corporate governance requirements of any
U.S. securities exchange.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 or the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act._**

We will not be subject to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes Oxley”). Sarbanes Oxley requires
public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of
material information and to have management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis.
Sarbanes Oxley also requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over financial
reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements and to have management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the
independent auditor for the company attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to
have comparable procedures in place as compared to public companies.

Univar will not be required to file periodic reports or other information with the SEC upon the closing of
this offering. Holders of the notes will be entitled to receive only certain reports as described under “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information.” These reports are, however, more limited than if we
were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Additionally, because our equity securities will not
be registered under the securities laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction and will not be listed on any
securities exchange, we will not be subject to certain of the corporate governance requirements of the U.S. securities
authorities or to any corporate governance requirements of any securities exchange.

**Risks Related to Technology**

**_Our business could be seriously impacted by cybersecurity incidents, including security breaches._**

Cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, private
information including without limitation the personally identifiable information (“PII”) of our employees or business
partners, cause a disruption in the Company’s operations or harm the Company’s reputation. During the normal
course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our
information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. To date, no cybersecurity
incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. Additionally, the increase in
remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased cyber-security and fraud risks.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s cyber-security programs, procedures, controls and intelligence will
be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Moreover such programs are costly to maintain and it is
expected that such costs will increase over time. If any security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of
sensitive information (including without limitation PII), critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our
operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or
cash flows, and could result in claims being brought against us.

**Litigation, Environmental and Regulatory Risk**

**_As a result of our current and past operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws_**
**_and regulations, which expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions
because we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport and arrange for the disposal of chemicals, hazardous
materials and hazardous waste. These include laws and regulations governing our management, storage,
transportation and disposal of chemicals; product regulation; air, water and soil contamination; activities related to
climate change; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites, including any spills or releases that may
result from our management, handling, storage, sale, or transportation of chemicals and other products. Compliance
with these laws and regulations, and with the permits and licenses we hold, requires that we expend significant
amounts for ongoing compliance, investigation and remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations,
permits or licenses, we may be subject to fines, damages and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions and
investigations, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In
addition, future changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could have an
adverse effect on us by adding restrictions, reducing our ability to do business, increasing our costs of doing
business, reducing our profitability or reducing the demand for our products.

Previous operations, including those of acquired companies, have resulted in contamination at a number of
current and former sites, which must be investigated and remediated. We have ongoing investigations and
remediation activities, or are contributing to cleanup costs, at approximately 128 currently or formerly owned,
operated or used sites or other sites impacted by our operations. We have spent substantial sums on such
investigation and remediation and we expect to continue to incur such expenditures in the future. We may incur
losses in connection with investigation and remediation obligations that exceed our environmental liabilities. There
is no guarantee that our estimates will be accurate, that new contamination will not be discovered or that new
environmental laws or regulations will not require us to incur additional costs. Any such inaccuracies, discoveries or
new laws or regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could be held liable for the costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any
real property we have ever owned, leased, operated or used or other sites impacted by our operations. Some
environmental laws could impose on us the entire cost of cleanup of contamination present at a site even though we
did not cause all of the contamination. These laws often identify parties who can be strictly and jointly and severally
liable for remediation. The discovery of previously unknown contamination at current or former sites or the
imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation or
remediation obligations with respect to contamination that has impacted other properties, could lead to additional
costs or the need for additional accruals that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or civil judgments related to third party
claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous materials or chemicals we blend,
handle, store, sell, transport or dispose of), product quality issues, property damage or contribution to remedial
obligations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at certain third party sites at which we have
arranged for the disposal of our hazardous wastes. We may be identified as a potentially responsible party at
additional sites beyond those for which we currently have financial obligations. Such developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Societal concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the
environment have resulted in a growing trend towards increasing levels of product safety and environmental
protection regulations. These concerns could influence public perceptions, impact the commercial viability of the
products we sell and increase the costs to comply with increasingly complex regulations, which could have a
negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional findings by government
agencies that chemicals pose significant environmental, health or safety risks may lead to their prohibition in some
or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate.


-----

**_Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The repackaging, blending, mixing, manufacturing, sale and distribution of chemical products by us,
including products used for food, pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement applications, involve an inherent risk of
exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity and reputational
harm. A product liability claim, judgment or recall against our customers could also result in substantial and
unexpected expenditures for us, affect confidence in our products or services and divert management’s attention
from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the type
or level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain
comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment
against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Many of the products we sell have “long-tail” exposures, giving rise to liabilities many years after their sale
and use. Insurance purchased at the time of sale may not be available when costs arise in the future and producers
may no longer be available to provide indemnification.

**_Our business is subject to additional general regulatory requirements, which increase our cost of doing business,_**
**_could result in claims and enforcement actions and could restrict our business in the future._**

Our general business operations are subject to a broad spectrum of international, federal, state and local
laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to antitrust, environmental, food and drug, labor
and human resources, tax, trade compliance, unclaimed property, transportation, anti-bribery, banking and treasury,
privacy and data protection (including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), among others.
These laws and regulations add cost to our conduct of business and could, in some instances, result in claims or
enforcement actions or could reduce our ability to pursue business opportunities. Any changes in the laws and
regulations applicable to us, the enactment of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with, or
increased enforcement activity of, such laws and regulations, could significantly impact our products and services
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally,
governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.

**_We are exposed to litigation and other legal and regulatory actions and risks in the ordinary course of our_**
**_business, and we could incur significant liabilities and substantial legal fees._**

Especially because of the nature of our business, we are subject to the risk of litigation, other legal claims
and proceedings, and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of our business. Also, there may be
safety or personal injury risks related to our products which are not known today. The results of legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot guarantee that the results of current or future legal proceedings will
not materially harm our business, reputation or brand, nor can we guarantee that we will not incur losses in
connection with current or future legal proceedings that exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of
such proceedings or that exceed any applicable insurance coverage. The occurrence of any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**International Market Risk**

**_Our results of operations could suffer if we are unable to expand into new geographic markets or manage the_**
**_various risks related to our international activities._**

Our profitability and longer-term success may be adversely affected if we fail to continue to expand our
penetration in certain foreign markets and to enter new and emerging foreign markets. The profitability of our
international operations will largely depend on our continued success in the following areas:

    - securing key producer relationships to help establish our presence in international markets;


-----

- hiring and training personnel capable of supporting producers and our customers and managing
operations in foreign countries;

- localizing our business processes to meet the specific needs and preferences of foreign producers and
customers;

- building our reputation and awareness of our services among foreign producers and customers; and

- implementing new financial, management information and operational systems, procedures and
controls to monitor our operations in new markets effectively, without causing undue disruptions to
our operations and customer and producer relationships.

In addition, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:

- varying and often unclear legal and regulatory requirements that may be subject to inconsistent or
disparate enforcement, particularly regarding environmental, health and safety issues and security or
other certification requirements, as well as other laws and business practices that favor local
competitors, such as exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on investments by
foreign companies or other governmental actions;

- less stable supply sources;

- regional conflicts that may result in supply chain disruptions;

- competition from existing market participants that may have a longer history in and greater familiarity
with the foreign markets where we operate;

- tariffs, export duties, quotas and other barriers to trade; as well as possible limitations on the
conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by our
foreign subsidiaries;

- divergent labor regulations and cultural expectations regarding employment and agency;

- different cultural expectations regarding industrialization, international business and business
relationships;

- foreign taxes and related regulations, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against
taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to
repatriate earnings to the United States;

- extended payment terms and challenges in our ability to collect accounts receivable;

- changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;

- compliance with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act
and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, the violation of which could expose us to severe
criminal or civil sanctions; and

- compliance with anti-boycott, privacy, economic sanctions, anti-dumping, antitrust, import and export
laws and regulations by our employees or intermediaries acting on our behalf, the violation of which
could expose us to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions.


-----

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations._**

We have sizable sales and operations in Canada, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. We
report our consolidated results in US dollars and the results of operations and the financial position of our local
operations are generally reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into US dollars at the applicable
exchange rates. As a result, our financial performance is impacted by currency fluctuations.

**Employee and Benefit Plan Risk**

**_We may be unable to attract or retain a qualified and diverse workforce._**

We depend upon the ability and experience of a number of our executive management and other key
personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the chemicals and chemical distribution industries
and the selected markets in which we operate. The loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior
executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also might suffer
an additional impact on our business if one of our senior executives or key employees is hired by a competitor.

In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and
develop qualified and diverse personnel to operate and expand our businesses. We compete with other companies
both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we fail to hire, retain and develop a sufficient
number of qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our businesses, our businesses, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath
contributed to fewer workers participating in the workforce than in February 2020. We expect we will continue to
experience labor shortages, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Negative developments affecting our pension and multi-employer pension plans in which we participate may_**
**_occur._**

We operate a number of pension plans for our employees and have obligations with respect to several
multi-employer pension plans sponsored by labor unions in the United States. The terms of these plans vary from
country to country. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with the Company’s pension plans are affected
by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and
the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a
number of assumptions, which represent management’s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the
most significant impact on costs and liabilities are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets for
the funded plans, retirement rates and mortality rates. Changes to the funded status of our pension plans as a result
of updates to actuarial assumptions and actual experience that differs from our estimates are recognized as gains or
losses in the period incurred under our “mark to market” accounting policy, and could result in a requirement for
additional funding.

As of December 31, 2022, our pension plans were underfunded by $82.7 million. Rising interest rates have
positively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. When interest rates decline, funding requirements for our
pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our
obligations under these pension plans, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures,
seek additional capital, or incur indebtedness. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan
union sponsored multi-employer pension plan in which we participated until 2021 is also underfunded. While we
have recorded an estimated withdrawal liability associated with leaving this plan, changes to that estimate could
force us to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital or incur indebtedness.

**_A portion of our workforce is unionized and labor disruptions could decrease our profitability._**

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 24% of our labor force is covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, including approximately 12%, 46% and 24% of our labor force in the United States, Europe and Canada,
respectively. Approximately 1% of our labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire


-----

within one year. These arrangements grant certain protections to employees. We cannot guarantee that we will be
able to negotiate these or other collective bargaining agreements or arrangements with works councils on the same
or more favorable terms as the current agreements or arrangements, or at all, and without interruptions, including
labor stoppages at the facility or facilities subject to any particular agreement or arrangement. A prolonged labor
dispute, which could include a work stoppage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**Environmental, Social, and Governance Risks**

**_Our ability to execute on our initiatives and goals related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG)_**
**_matters and the increasing legal and regulatory focus on ESG could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which may require ongoing investment to
execute, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their
intended outcomes. In addition, our ability to implement some of our strategies and goals may be dependent on
external factors out of our control such as third-party collaboration, scientific and technological developments, and
the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale. A failure to achieve our goals could expose our business
to reputational damage and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

U.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters
and new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters are under consideration. Such laws
and regulations could affect the output of producers of commodity and specialty chemicals as well as demand in the
end markets our customers serve. Responding to any such laws and regulations could require us to incur additional
expenditures to either purchase new, or modify existing, equipment or processes, and the implementation of new
practices and reporting processes could introduce additional compliance risk. In addition, any such laws and
regulations could expose us to fines, litigation and increased tax responsibilities, and negatively impact our ability to
compete with companies situated in geographies not subject to such limitations. A failure to meet the increasing
ESG expectations of our investors and customers could also lead to market share loss.

**Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds**

**_In the event that the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Merger is_**
**_terminated at any time prior thereto, or other conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds of this offering_**
**_are not satisfied, the notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption and, as a result, you may not obtain_**
**_the return you expect on the notes._**

If the issuance of the notes occurs prior to the closing of the Merger, pending consummation of the Merger,
the gross proceeds from this offering of the notes and certain additional amounts from time to time as described
under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” will be deposited into a
segregated escrow account pledged as collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes. However, in lieu of
depositing all or a portion of such additional amounts in the escrow account, at the Issuer’s option one or more
letters of credit or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters may be provided instead. See “Description of
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The escrow agent will release the escrow proceeds to
us at the time of the consummation of the Merger if the Escrow Conditions described in this offering memorandum
are satisfied. The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions. If the Escrow Conditions are not
satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem all of the outstanding
notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the issue price of the notes, together with interest accrued and unpaid
on the notes, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon a special mandatory redemption, you may not
be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if
you purchase the notes at a price greater than the issue price of the notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment.


-----

**_Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the holders of the notes will effectively only have recourse to the funds_**
**_deposited in the escrow account._**

On the issue date the notes will be issued solely by, and will be the obligation solely of, the Issuer and will
not be guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries. Until the consummation of the Merger, holders of the notes will only
have (i) a first-priority security interest in any interest the Issuer has in the escrow collateral and (ii) a right to
receive the funds held in the escrow account if the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied, as described under
“Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and will not have any recourse to the
Issuer’s subsidiaries. The Issuer will have limited assets until the consummation of the Merger and no significant
independent operations. The Issuer will only be required to deposit amounts in respect of accrued interest into the
escrow account related to the notes on a monthly basis for the following month or, instead of depositing such
amounts, at its option, funds managed by affiliates or certain investment affiliates of the Sponsor may provide one or
more letters of credit or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters. As a result, the ability of the Issuer to pay
accrued interest on the notes upon the occurrence of a special mandatory redemption of the notes may depend on the
enforceability of any of the Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters and the performance by the Sponsor of its
obligations under such Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters. See “Description of Notes—Escrow Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.” In addition, we may cause one or more letters of credit to be issued to fund a
portion of the special mandatory redemption from escrow and have not determined the issuer(s) of such letter(s) of
credit. Holders of the notes would be subject to the credit risk of any such letter of credit issuer(s). Therefore, the
ability of holders to receive accrued interest on the notes in the case of a special mandatory redemption of all of the
notes could be limited under certain circumstances.

**_If a bankruptcy or reorganization case is commenced, the escrowed funds might be deemed to be property of the_**
**_bankruptcy estate such that bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of funds in the escrow account and the_**
**_holders of the notes might become unsecured creditors._**

If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against the Issuer,
while amounts remain in the escrow account described under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption,” applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the escrow agent from releasing the funds in the
escrow account or applying those funds to effect the special mandatory redemption, as applicable, of the notes or
otherwise applying those funds for the benefit of the holders of the notes. The court adjudicating that case might find
that such escrow account is the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the escrow account will
be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the special mandatory redemption price, the automatic stay
provisions of the U.S. federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from foreclosing upon or
disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the facts
and circumstances of any particular case or could be materially delayed). As a result, the holders of the notes may
not be able to have the escrow funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture, and could
suffer a loss as a result.

In addition, if the court adjudicating the Issuer’s bankruptcy or reorganization case finds that the escrowed
funds are property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate
or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, over the objection of the holders of the notes with or without
restrictions or could order that the holders accept different, less liquid collateral than the funds in the escrow
account. As a result, the holders of the notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.

**_The parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of the Merger_**
**_Agreement without noteholder consent._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to amendments
or waivers of the terms thereof. The release of the escrow funds pursuant to the escrow agreement is not conditioned
on the holders of the notes consenting to any such amendment or waiver, so long as the Merger is consummated in
all material respects as described under “Summary—The Transactions.” Accordingly, the Merger Agreement may
be amended or waived in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the holders of the notes.


-----

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund_**
**_our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making_**
**_debt service payments on the notes._**

After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we will be a highly leveraged company. As of the closing
of the Merger, after giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to have $4,600.0 million face value of outstanding
indebtedness (excluding capital leases and finance lease obligations), and approximately $677.9 million available for
borrowing under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing base availability of
approximately $1,307.2 million, approximately $500.0 expected to be drawn as of the closing date and
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date), and for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we would have had total pro forma debt service payment obligations of
approximately $411.1 million.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you as a holder of the notes. For
example, it could:

    - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the
notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including
restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture
governing the notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness;

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest
and the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

    - make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive
disadvantage;

    - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new
technologies, making capital expenditures or exploiting business opportunities;

    - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things,
our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets;

    - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all notes tendered to us upon the occurrence
of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event of default under
the indenture governing the notes; or

    - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under the Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest.

In addition, the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the notes will
contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best
interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived,
could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.


-----

**_Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured_**
**_debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of
the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities will contain restrictions
on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of
important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.
As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $677.9 million available for borrowing under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of
estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million, approximately $500.0 million expected to
be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of
the closing date), all of which would be secured. The covenants under the indenture governing the notes and the
credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities will, and the covenants under any other of our existing or future
debt instruments could, allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and, subject to certain
limitations, such additional indebtedness could be secured. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn
our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under “—Our substantial indebtedness could
materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react
to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes.” In
addition, certain hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements that are entered into with the lenders
under the ABL Facility will be secured by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund_**
**_our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under our indebtedness that may not be successful._**

Our ability to pay principal and interest on the notes and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend
upon, among other things:

    - our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic,
industry and competitive conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control;

    - our future ability to refinance or restructure our debt obligations, which depends on, among other
things, the condition of the capital markets, our financial condition and the terms of existing or future
debt agreements; and

    - our future ability to borrow under the ABL Facility, the availability of which depends on, among other
things, our compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to
draw under the ABL Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the
payment of principal and interest on the notes or our other indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are
insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek
additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may
not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or
refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, and
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the capital markets on terms that are attractive or at all.
These risks have been heightened as a result of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including
elevated inflation and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, among other things. Any refinancing of our
debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of
our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements,
including the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and


-----

might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may
not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could
realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Following the
closing of the Transactions, our Sponsor and its affiliates and our other equityholders have no continuing obligation
to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt
obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could result in a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could negatively impact our ability
to satisfy our obligations under the notes.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders of the notes
could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities
could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and terminate their commitments to loan
money, our secured lenders (including the lenders under the Credit Facilities and the holders of the notes) could
foreclose against the assets securing their loans and the notes and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
All of these events could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the notes.

If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to repay or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness,
including the notes, before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to
enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

**_Repayment of the Issuer’s debt, including the notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by its subsidiaries._**

The Issuer is a holding company and has no direct operations other than holding the equity interests in its
subsidiaries, including Univar, and activities directly related thereto. Accordingly, repayment of the Issuer’s
indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the Issuer’s subsidiaries and, if
they are not guarantors of the notes, their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries will not have any
obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries
may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect
of its indebtedness, including the notes. Each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and under certain
circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from them, and the
Issuer may be limited in its ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to the Issuer. While
the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities will limit the ability of
the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany
payments to the Issuer, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the
Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

The notes will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that are
not guaranteeing the notes, and the claims of creditors of these subsidiaries, including trade creditors, will have
priority as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred
equity interests and their trade and other creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. As
of March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries held approximately 36% of our consolidated assets and during
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 34% of our total
revenues and approximately 34% of our Reported Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 31, 2023, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries had approximately $387.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations. We
may create, acquire or designate additional entities that are non-guarantors in the future.

In addition, the indenture governing the notes will, subject to some limitations, permit these non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities,
such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Moreover, the indenture will not restrict the
amount of indebtedness or other liabilities that can be incurred by our unrestricted subsidiaries.


-----

The notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any other subsidiaries that are not
material or wholly-owned, including certain foreign subsidiaries that will be obligors under the ABL Facility. These
non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefore, whether by dividends, loans,
distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any of
the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights
of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively
subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity
interests of those subsidiaries.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the_**
**_notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including defaults under the Credit
Facilities that are not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness
could leave us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on the notes and could substantially decrease the
market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds
necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness, or if we
otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments
governing our indebtedness (including the Credit Facilities), we could be in default under the terms of the
agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect
to (i) declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
(ii) terminate their commitments and cease making further loans and (iii) institute foreclosure proceedings against
our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders
under the Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants and seek a waiver, we may not be
able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or noteholders. In such a case, we would be in default under these
facilities, the lenders and noteholders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

Upon any such bankruptcy filing, we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the notes
(and any guarantor that had also filed for bankruptcy would also be stayed from making any ongoing payments on
the applicable guarantee), and the holders of the notes may not be legally entitled to receive post-petition interest or
applicable fees, costs or charges, or any “adequate protection” under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended
(the “Bankruptcy Code”).

**_The lenders under the Term Loan Facility will have the discretion to release any guarantors under the Term_**
**_Loan Facility or liens securing the Term Loan Facility in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those_**
**_guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the notes or such liens to be released from the security_**
**_interests securing the notes._**

While any obligations under the Term Loan Facility remain outstanding, any guarantee of the notes may be
released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the Trustee under the indenture that will govern
the notes, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the Term Loan Facility or any other
indebtedness. See “Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.” The lenders under the Term Loan Facility will
have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Term Loan Facility in a variety of circumstances. You will
not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and
other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be
senior to claims of noteholders.

In addition, liens on the collateral securing the notes will generally be released if the lenders under the
Term Loan Facility release their lien on such collateral, other than in connection with a termination of the Term
Loan Facility and payment in full of loans thereunder. Holders of the notes would therefore no longer have a secured
claim on such collateral and would only share ratably with all unsecured creditors in the value of such assets.


-----

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the notes will contain,
and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to,
among other things:

    - incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or
make other restricted payments;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - make loans or certain investments;

    - sell certain assets;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

    - substantially alter the businesses we conduct;

    - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

    - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the ABL Facility will require us to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—The ABL Facility—Restrictive Covenants and Other
Matters.”

As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we
may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.

A failure to comply with the covenants under the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities, the
indenture governing the notes or any of our other existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default,
which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In the event of any such event of default, the lenders under the Credit Facilities:

    - will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us, if applicable;

    - could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to
be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit;

    - could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or

    - could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes;

any of which could result in an event of default under the notes.

Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to


-----

repay those amounts, the lenders under the Credit Facilities and any of our other existing or future secured
indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the Credit Facilities or such other
indebtedness (including the notes). We will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Credit
Facilities and the notes.

If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities or our other indebtedness, including the
notes, were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such
indebtedness in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees of the notes_**
**_will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in connection with a sale or other
disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture. The
indenture governing the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a
guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the subsidiary guarantee of such guarantor
being automatically released. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the
indenture governing the notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries
will be released, which will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes. If the guarantee by a
subsidiary guarantor of the Term Loan Facility is released or discharged, other than in connection with a termination
of the Term Loan Facility and payment in full of loans thereunder, or a subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a
subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing certain secured indebtedness,
such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well. If the guarantee of any subsidiary
guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the
indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or
unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of
all circumstances in which a subsidiary guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see
“Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus, without duplication, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Additionally, under the Credit Facilities, a change of control
constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings and terminate their
commitments to lend. The source of funds for any repurchase of the notes and repayment of any borrowings under
the Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other
sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds
at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in the Credit Facilities
will not allow such repurchases. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such
repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to
repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged
recapitalizations and securitizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a change
of control under the indenture governing the notes, but could affect our capital structure or credit ratings. See
“Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

Courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which will be the governing law of
the indenture governing the notes) have not provided clear and consistent meanings of such change of control
provisions which leads to subjective judicial interpretation. In addition, a court case in Delaware has questioned
whether a change of control provision contained in an indenture could be unenforceable on public policy grounds.

**_We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could affect our ability to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the indenture


-----

governing the notes may allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a change of control but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our
ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes. The definition of change of control for purposes of the notes
includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets taken as a whole. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require us to repurchase notes as a result of a transfer of
less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the notes at maturity._**

At the maturity of the notes, the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, will become due and payable. We may not have the funds to fulfill these obligations or the
ability to renegotiate these obligations. If, upon the maturity date, other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the
notes, we could try to obtain waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or
we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. In these circumstances, if we were not
able to obtain such waivers or refinance these borrowings, we would be unable to repay the notes.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and guarantees and any_**
**_related security interests and require noteholders to return payments received and applicable law may also limit_**
**_the maximum amount the subsidiary guarantors may guarantee._**

If we or any guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code or encounters other financial
difficulty, under federal or state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law a court may void or otherwise
decline to enforce the notes or the guarantees and any related security interests. A court might do so if it found that
when we issued the notes or a subsidiary guarantor entered into its guarantee or granted any related security
interests, or in some states when payments became due under the notes or the guarantees, we or such subsidiary
guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business as conducted or contemplated;

    - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay; or

    - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed
against us or the subsidiary guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

The court might also void an issuance of notes or a guarantee or any related security interests, without
regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the notes or the applicable guarantor entered into its
guarantee or granted any related security interests with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court passing on us or a guarantor
regarding the notes or any guarantee or the related security interests would likely find that we or a guarantor did not
receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee or any related security
interests if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the
notes. Specifically, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since
the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the
applicable subsidiary guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees and any related security interests or
take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes or any
guarantee or any related security interest, you would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable
guarantor, or the right to enforce upon the underlying collateral that is the subject of the related security interest in
question. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining
obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or a


-----

guarantor. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the avoidance of the notes could result in an event of default with
respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws will
vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred,
such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or any of the
guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not
determine that we or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date or that any payments to the holders of the notes
(including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other
grounds. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

    - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

The guarantee by each guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor is permitted to
guarantee under applicable law. As a result, any such guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to
zero, depending on, among other things, the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Although each guarantee
entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum
amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer or fraudulent conveyance, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those
guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount
that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we
or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to
a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year
period prior to a bankruptcy filing or third party within a 90-day period prior to a bankruptcy filing and such
payment would give such insider or third party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under
the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Also, any future guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes might be avoidable by the guarantor (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by its other creditors) as a preferential transfer or
otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the guarantor is insolvent at
the time of the guarantee, that guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a
bankruptcy case of the guarantor under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code than if such guarantee had not been given,
and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the
guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. To the extent that the guarantee is avoided as
a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the guarantee.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or
guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of equitable subordination if
the court determines that (i) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable
conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and
(iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.


-----

After giving effect to the Transactions, assuming the ABL Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed
blended interest rates would result in an approximately $4.6 million change in annual interest expense on
indebtedness under the Credit Facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the
exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not
maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may
not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks.

In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”) convened by the Federal Reserve
Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a
new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities, as the rate that,
in the consensus view of the ARRC, represented best practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and
other financial contracts. The Credit Facilities will carry floating interest rates that are tied to SOFR.

SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury
securities. SOFR is observed on a daily basis and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the
current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate for specified tenors and relies, to some degree, on
the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government
securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is
therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions.
As a result, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such reference rate in underlying contractual
arrangements, and there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any
time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility
or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events.

Publication of SOFR began in April 2018 and it therefore has a limited history. The future performance of
SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical performance. Prior observed patterns, if any, in the
behavior of market variables may change in the future. While some pre-publication historical data have been
released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, such analysis inherently involves assumptions, estimates and
approximations. The future performance of SOFR is impossible to predict, and therefore no future performance of
SOFR may be inferred from any of the historical simulations or historical performance. Hypothetical or historical
performance data are not indicative of, and have no bearing on, the potential performance of the SOFR.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as administrator of SOFR, may make methodological or other
changes that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to the method by which SOFR is
calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate SOFR or timing related to the
publication of SOFR. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a change in
the amount of our annual interest expense on our indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable_**
**_securities laws, and the notes are not subject to any registration rights. The indenture governing the notes will not_**
**_be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust_**
**_Indenture Act._**

The notes are being issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under U.S. and applicable state
securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. and applicable state securities laws, and you may be
required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. By receiving the notes, you will be
deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer
Restrictions.” We and the guarantors will, not be obligated to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under
U.S. securities laws or register the reoffer and resale of notes under U.S. securities laws. As a result, the
transferability of the notes may be negatively affected. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The indenture will not be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and the Issuer will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of
the Trust Indenture Act or similar provisions in the indenture.


-----

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no_**
**_assurance that any active trading market will develop, or if developed be maintained, for the notes._**

The notes are a new issue of securities for which there is no established public market. We do not intend to
have the notes listed on a national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system. Affiliates of
certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations; however, they are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and they may
discontinue their market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, the ability of the initial purchasers
to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of
regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities)
applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes. Therefore, an
active or liquid market for the notes may not develop or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any
market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our performance, the market for similar
securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors. If an active market
does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the notes may be materially and adversely affected.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may not be free from
similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In
addition, the notes may trade at a discount from their value on the date you acquired the notes, depending upon
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

Furthermore, recent regulatory actions by the SEC under Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act (and any
potential regulatory developments stemming from the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to
debt securities) may restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes on any interdealer
quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025, which may materially affect the liquidity and
trading prices for the notes. As a consequence, an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the
notes, you may not be able to sell the notes, or, even if you can sell the notes, you may not be able to sell them at an
acceptable price. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until certificated notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the notes, owners of
the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of notes. Instead, DTC, or its nominee, will be the
sole holder of the notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the notes in
global form will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to DTC. Thereafter, such payments will be
credited to DTC participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the notes in global form and credited by
such participants to indirect participants. Unlike holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will
not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the notes. Instead, if a holder owns a book-entry interest, such holder will be permitted to act only to the
extent such holder has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, a participant. We cannot
assure holders that the procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable holders
to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

**_Changes in our credit rating could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the notes. A
negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices of the notes and on our
ability to obtain future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, provided that at such time no
default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants will include restrictions on, among other
things, our ability to make certain distributions, incur indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There
can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or that if the notes ever are rated investment
grade they will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain
transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. To the extent the covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of
default under the indenture governing the notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_The terms and conditions of the Credit Facilities have not been finalized._**

The credit agreements relating to the Credit Facilities have not been finalized. Our entry into the Credit
Facilities is subject to market conditions, and we cannot assure you that the Credit Facilities will be completed in the
manner, on the terms or on the timetable described herein, or at all. Future changes in market conditions may result
in less favorable terms for the Credit Facilities and any changes to the terms of the Credit Facilities may increase our
interest expense and adversely affect our business. The terms of the Credit Facilities could also change in a way that
increases our indebtedness or makes it easier to incur debt in the future.

**_We will in most cases have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the notes and the guarantees._**

The collateral documents for the notes allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over,
freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the notes and the related
guarantees.

In addition, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of the Trust Indenture Act, including,
without limitation, Section 314(d) thereof. We may, therefore, among other things, without any release or consent by
the Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to collateral permitted by the indenture governing the
notes, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments (including repayments of indebtedness), all of which could reduce the pool of assets securing the notes.
See “Description of Notes—Security.”

**_The notes and related guarantees will be secured on a ratable basis with the collateral securing the Term Loan_**
**_Facility, except that the notes will not be guaranteed by Holdings which guarantees the Term Loan Facility on a_**
**_limited recourse basis and the notes and related guarantees will not be secured by a pledge of the equity interests_**
**_Holdings directly holds of the Issuer which secures the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we can incur additional_**
**_debt that would also be ratably secured._**

The notes and related guarantees will be secured by liens on the collateral, which also secures, on a ratable
basis, obligations under the Term Loan Facility and certain related hedging, cash management and bank product
obligations, in each case, subject to certain permitted liens, exceptions and encumbrances described in the indenture
governing the notes and the security documents relating to the notes, such exceptions including that (1) Holdings
guarantees the Term Loan Facility on a limited recourse basis but will not guarantee the notes and (2) Holdings
pledges all of the equity interests it directly holds of the Issuer to secure the Term Loan Facility but will not pledge
such equity interests to secure the notes. As such, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all of the notes. As set
out in more detail under “Description of Notes—Security,” lenders under the ABL Facility, lenders under the Term
Loan Facility and certain of our hedging, cash management and bank product obligations will also be entitled to
receive proceeds from the realization of the collateral along with holders of the notes upon foreclosure on collateral
or in the event of our or any subsidiary guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization
or similar proceeding. In the event of our or any subsidiary guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,
dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding, the collateral must be used to pay the obligations under the Term
Loan Facility and holders of certain of our hedging, cash management and bank product obligations and the notes
ratably, pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement entered into for the benefit of the holders of the notes and
the lenders under our Term Loan Facility, subject, in the case of the ABL Priority Collateral, to first satisfying our
obligations under the ABL Facility and other obligations that are secured by a first-priority lien on the ABL Priority
Collateral pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the indenture governing the notes


-----

will permit us and the guarantors to create additional liens under specified circumstances, including liens senior in
priority and pari passu to the liens on the collateral securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may
further limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

**_The secured indebtedness under the ABL Facility is effectively senior to the notes and the Term Loan Facility to_**
**_the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral._**

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that, upon an enforcement action or insolvency, holders of
indebtedness under the ABL Facility will be entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of the ABL Priority Collateral
upon a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding before the proceeds are applied to
pay obligations with respect to the notes and the Term Loan Facility. Holders of the indebtedness under the ABL
Facility will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the realization of value of the ABL Priority Collateral to repay
such indebtedness in full before the holders of the notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be
entitled to any recovery from such collateral. Certain hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements
that are entered into with the lenders under the ABL Facility will be secured by the same collateral that secures the
ABL Facility. As a result, the notes and the Term Loan Facility will effectively be junior in right of payment to
indebtedness under our ABL Facility and such other obligations to the extent of the realizable value of ABL Priority
Collateral and holders of the notes and lenders under the Term Loan Facility will only be entitled to receive
proceeds from the realization of value of the ABL Priority Collateral after all indebtedness and other obligations
under the ABL Facility are repaid in full. In addition, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of
each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the notes, including the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries that
will be obligors under the ABL Facility. A substantial portion of the collateral constitutes ABL Priority Collateral.
The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also contains a number of waivers by holders of the notes and the lenders under
the Term Loan Facility of important rights that otherwise accrue to secured creditors in a bankruptcy. For a more
complete description, see “Description of Notes—Security.”

Approximately $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the ABL Facility is expected to be drawn at
the closing of the Merger (in addition to approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding
as of the closing date). Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of
March 31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and approximately
$129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, we would have had
approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions. The estimated borrowing base availability of $1,307.2 million as of
March 31, 2023 will be updated based on a field exam and appraisal and therefore could differ as of the closing date
of the Transactions. There can be no assurances that the borrowing base availability will be the same or higher in the
future. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility. See “Use of Proceeds” and
“Capitalization.”

**_The rights of holders of the notes in the ABL Priority Collateral may be adversely affected by the ABL_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement._**

Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the
obligations under the ABL Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to
be secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a first-priority basis, will rank senior to the liens on the notes and the
related guarantees. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the obligations under the ABL Facility (or
any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be secured by the ABL Priority
Collateral on a first-priority basis (including post-petition interest, fees and expenses, whether or not allowed or
allowable in any bankruptcy case), will be paid with the proceeds of the ABL Priority Collateral prior to the
obligations under the notes and related guarantees in certain circumstances, including in the event of any foreclosure
by the lenders under the ABL Facility or a bankruptcy event. The lenders under the ABL Facility, as holders of firstpriority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, will control substantially all enforcement matters related to such ABL
Priority Collateral, pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the permitted firstpriority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, including under the ABL Facility, may cause the collateral agent under
the ABL Facility (the “ABL Agent”) to dispose of, release, or foreclose on, or take other actions with respect to, the
ABL Priority Collateral (including certain amendments of and waivers under the security documents with respect


-----

thereto) with which holders of the notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the notes,
even after a default under the notes in the case of an enforcement action by the ABL Agent.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit parties with second-priority liens on the ABL Priority
Collateral, including the holders of the notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Facility, from foreclosing on such
collateral at any time prior to the payment in full of the permitted obligations secured by the ABL Priority Collateral
on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Credit Facility. To the extent the ABL Priority
Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a first-priority basis,
including all obligations under the ABL Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in certain
circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the ABL Agent, in connection with a sale
or other disposition of the ABL Priority Collateral permitted under the terms of both the ABL Facility and indenture
governing the senior secured or during an event of default under the ABL Facility, in connection with a sale
consented to by the ABL Agent), the second-priority liens securing the notes in the ABL Priority Collateral will
automatically also be released. In addition, the security documents related to the holders of the notes’ secondpriority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent and each other collateral agent party to the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral until such firstpriority lien obligations are paid in full, and the security documents related to the first-priority lien on the ABL
Priority Collateral securing the obligations under the ABL Facility may not be amended in any manner that
contravenes the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Collateral Agent. The ABL
Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the notes would be
required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer with
respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of the
obligations under the ABL Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of the ABL Priority Collateral
would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the notes after payment in full of the
obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, including all obligations under the
ABL Facility. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL Credit
Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of ABL Priority Collateral or debtor-in-possession
(“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the ABL Priority Collateral, the holders of the notes would
(assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the Notes Priority
Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) be limited in raising objections to such
use of cash collateral or DIP financing. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the holders of
the notes to raise various other objections or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the ABL Facility,
including, among other things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral,
and will also place certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the ABL
Priority Collateral from a bankruptcy court, even though such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were
being affected.

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a lien on the collateral that secures our Term Loan_**
**_Facility, the representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility will initially control actions with respect_**
**_to the collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral that will secure the notes and the Term
Loan Facility on a ratable basis will be subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the Trustee, the
administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility and the collateral agent for the notes and the Term Loan Facility.
Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral,
including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control
such proceedings will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility
until (1) our obligations under the Term Loan Facility are discharged (which discharge does not include certain
refinancings of our Term Loan Facility) or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the
indenture governing the notes, if the authorized representative of the holders of the notes represents the largest
outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral (other than the Term
Loan Facility) and has complied with the applicable notice provisions and if the notes are at the time due and


-----

payable in full. As of the issue date, Wilmington Trust, National Association, the Trustee, will be the authorized
representative for the noteholders under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the
administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility, will be the authorized representative for the Term Loan Facility
under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Wilmington Trust, National Association will be the collateral agent for
the notes and the Term Loan Facility.

However, even if the authorized representative of the notes gains the right to direct the collateral agent in
the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers
with respect to the collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under our Term Loan
Facility) if the authorized representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility has commenced and is
diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that
collateral (whether the Issuer or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or
otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

In addition, the documents governing our indebtedness will permit us, subject to certain limits, to issue
additional series of notes or other debt that also have a first-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. At any time
that the representative of the lenders under our Term Loan Facility does not have the right to take actions with
respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes to the authorized
representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a firstpriority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. If we issue additional notes or other debt that is equal in priority to the
liens securing the notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative
for those additional notes or other debt would be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the notes.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the notes may
not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of the
shared collateral to secure that financing, or to the use of cash collateral unless and until the authorized
representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility object thereto, subject to certain conditions and limited
exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the notes
would be unable to raise an objection.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the notes and the collateral will exclude certain_**
**_“excluded property”._**

The collateral securing the notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections as may be accepted by the collateral agent for the notes and any other creditors that have the
benefit of senior priority liens on the collateral securing the notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the
notes are issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could
materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral
agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. In addition, the collateral will exclude certain “excluded property”
and the value of such excluded property could be material. See “Description of Notes—Security.” These assets that
are excluded from the collateral securing the notes and related guarantees may be pledged to secure other
indebtedness. Consequently, our obligations under the Credit Facilities, the notes and the related guarantees would
be effectively subordinated to other indebtedness that is secured by assets not constituting collateral securing the
notes, to the extent of the value of such assets. Furthermore, because Holdings will not be a guarantor, no assets of
Holdings (including the capital stock of the Issuer) will secure the notes even though such assets secure the Term
Loan Facility and the ABL Facility.

The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
availability of suitable buyers. No appraisals of any of the collateral have been prepared by us or on behalf of us in
connection with this offering. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of
this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the
assets pledged as collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions,
our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events.
Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes, the ABL


-----

Facility, the Term Loan Facility and any additional future pari passu obligations. Any claim for the difference
between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the collateral securing the notes and the
obligations under the notes, the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility and any additional future pari passu
obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and
other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or
against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the
notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses would cease to accrue on the notes from
and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed and you will not be entitled to adequate protection on account of
any undersecured portion of your claims.

The security interest of the collateral agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of
a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will
be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given
when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the collateral agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the collateral securing the notes is subject to liens permitted under the indenture governing the
notes, whether arising on or after the date the notes are issued. The existence of any permitted liens could materially
and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes, as well as the ability of the collateral agent to
realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, not all of the Issuer’s and subsidiary guarantors’ assets will
secure the notes. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

**_Pledges of equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries may not constitute collateral for the repayment of_**
**_the notes because such pledges may not be perfected pursuant to foreign law pledge documents._**

Part of the collateral securing the notes may consist of a pledge of certain equity interests of foreign
subsidiaries owned by us or our subsidiary guarantors (limited to 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the
non-voting capital stock of CFCs). Although such pledges of capital stock will be required to be granted under U.S.
security documents, it may be necessary or desirable to perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge documents.
We will not be required to provide such foreign law pledge documents. Unless and until such pledges of equity
interests are properly perfected, they may not constitute collateral for the notes.

**_Foreign law security documents, and perfection or other actions under foreign law will not be required, but will_**
**_be entered into and taken for the benefit of the lenders under the ABL Facility._**

We will not be required to provide foreign law security documents or take perfection or other actions under
foreign law. The ABL Facility will require foreign law security documents, and perfection and other actions under
foreign law for the benefit of the lenders under the ABL Facility. Accordingly, even though certain assets may be of
the type that constitute Notes Priority Collateral, the ABL lenders may have a superior or prior security interest in
such asset by virtue of the foreign law security documents or other perfection steps taken outside of the United
States for the benefit of the lenders under the ABL Facility.

**_Security over some of the collateral may not be in place on the issue date or may not be perfected on such date,_**
**_and any unresolved issues may impact the value of the collateral. Rights in the collateral may be materially and_**
**_adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral now or in the future._**

Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the
collateral securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such notes if the collateral agent for
the notes is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the indenture
governing the notes. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the noteholders’ security interest in
specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements, delivery of certain stock certificates and
instruments, if permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, filings with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, and the filing of mortgages and other
perfection actions required by the security documents. We will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to


-----

have all security interests that are required to be perfected by the security documents to be in place within a
specified period of time after the issue date or, if the Merger is not consummated on the issue date, the Merger
Closing Date. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such
security interests may negatively impact the value of the collateral. To the extent a security interest in certain
collateral is not perfected on the issue date of the notes (or, if the Merger is not consummated on the issue date, the
Merger Closing Date), such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or
otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property
and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, certain intellectual property
and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither
the Trustee nor the collateral agent for the notes will monitor and neither has any obligation to monitor, and there
can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and
rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in
such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the
priority of the security interest in favor of the collateral agent for the notes, as applicable, against third parties. Even
if the collateral agent for the notes does take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests, any
such security interests that are perfected after the date of the indenture (or, if the Merger is not consummated on the
issue date, the Merger Closing Date) would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer or otherwise in
any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on such date were no longer subject to such risk. In
addition, even if the collateral agent for the notes does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired in the future,
such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy case under
certain circumstances. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date
increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

The indenture governing the notes and the security documents will not require us to take a number of
actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the collateral agent for the benefit of the senior
secured noteholders. As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the collateral agent for the benefit of the
senior secured noteholders in a portion of the collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be subject to
other liens) under applicable law.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the_**
**_notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (other than to the Issuer or a subsidiary guarantor)
in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture;

    - in respect of the property and assets of a restricted subsidiary that is a subsidiary guarantor, upon the
designation of such subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the
indenture;

    - with respect to collateral held by a subsidiary guarantor, upon the release of such subsidiary guarantor
from its guarantee, including the release of such subsidiary guarantor from its guarantee at any time the
notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P (provided that no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing at such time);

    - pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or ABL Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Collateral” and “Description of Notes—Security.”

**_The security interests of the senior secured noteholders in after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a timely_**
**_manner or at all._**

If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the
indenture governing the notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security


-----

interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral,
additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of
physical collateral, if permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of
mortgages or deeds of trust. Even if such additional actions are taken to perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral, to the extent a security interest in any collateral is not perfected on the issue date of the notes,
such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or otherwise, which could impact
the value of the collateral. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date
increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_Bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral._**

The right of the collateral agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the collateral upon the
occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes is likely to be significantly impaired (or at
a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us
before the collateral agent repossessed and disposed of the collateral (and sometimes even after). Upon the
commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the collateral agent is prohibited
from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously
repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given under the particular
circumstances or could be materially delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to
retain and use collateral, including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt
instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate
protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured
creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments
or the granting of additional or replacement security or superpriority administrative expense claims if and at such
times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the
collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured
creditor may not require compensation for any such diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the
collateral exceeds the debt it secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case, or the length of any delay in making such payments;

    - whether or when the collateral agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time; or

    - whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss
of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection” or otherwise.

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require prior permission from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given or could be materially delayed). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy
court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is to be paid out
of the proceeds of the collateral, the holders of the notes would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value
of the collateral to which the holders of the notes are entitled and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall or
under collateralization. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs,
expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of its collateral
is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations
secured by the collateral, and the holders of the notes would not be entitled to adequate protection on account of any
undersecured portion of their claims.

In addition, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the holders of the notes
from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be


-----

provided to us that is secured by the collateral securing the notes or to the use of cash collateral that has not been
opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties thereunder,
subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral securing the notes
could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the_**
**_security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Certain security interests in favor of the collateral agent for the notes, including mortgages on certain of our
real properties and after-acquired property, will be granted or perfected after the Release Date. To the extent any
security interest in the collateral securing the notes is not perfected as of the Release Date, we will use our
commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected within 120 days following the Release
Date of the notes. Additionally, certain filings and other actions required for perfection of the liens on collateral,
prior to, on and after the date of the issuance of the notes may be delayed, or not completed at all, as a result of the
occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any applicable registration system, filing offices or
related service not being available. If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject
to a bankruptcy case after the issue date of the notes, any security interest in other collateral, or any guarantees
delivered after the issue date of the notes, would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on
the issue date of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy
or potentially by other creditors as a preference under bankruptcy law if certain events or circumstances exist or
occur.

Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under
bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing or “antecedent” indebtedness.
Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes, including
pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued,
may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time
of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of
the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been
given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the
pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a year.
Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and
(1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the notes had been perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the
issue date of the notes (as applicable) had been issued, less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy
case (or, if applicable, one year), such liens or guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a preference by the
bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the notes (even if the liens perfected or
other guarantees issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the
grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the
benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and may be required to return prior payments.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks, which may limit your ability to recover as a secured creditor if there are_**
**_losses to the collateral, and which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results._**

We maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards. There are, however, losses that may not
be insured. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance
proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the first-priority secured obligations, including the Term
Loan Facility, the notes and related guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss affecting any of our assets,
certain items may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage, the extended
period needed to obtain replacement units or inventory may cause significant delays, which may have an adverse
impact on our operations and results. In addition, certain zoning or other laws and regulations may prevent
rebuilding substantially the same facilities in the event of a loss, which may have an adverse impact on our
operations and results. Such adverse impacts may not be covered, or fully covered, by property or business
interruption insurance.


-----

**_State law may limit the ability of the collateral agent for the notes to foreclose on the real property and_**
**_improvements included in the collateral._**

The notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on future owned real property and improvements of
at least $50 million in fair market value. The laws of the states where any future real property is located may limit
the ability of the collateral agent and the holders of the notes to foreclose on the real property collateral and
improvements located in such states. State law governs the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage
liens against real property interests that secure debt obligations such as the notes. Applicable state laws may impose
procedural requirements for foreclosure different from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than
the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate
defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a
right of redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and one form of action rules
that can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless
of the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that lien searches on the collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees thereof
will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have an
adverse effect on the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose upon the collateral securing the notes and
guarantees thereof.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We intend to use the proceeds from the issuance of the notes, together with borrowings under the Credit
Facilities, the Equity Contribution and cash from the balance sheet of Univar, to fund the Transactions and pay
related fees and expenses. However, the issuance of the notes may occur prior to the completion of the Merger. If so,
on the issue date, pending the consummation of the Merger, the gross proceeds from this offering of the notes will
be deposited into a segregated escrow account pledged on a first-priority basis as collateral for the benefit of the
holders of the notes so long as the proceeds of the notes remain in escrow. The release of the escrowed proceeds will
be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions,
assuming they occurred on March 31, 2023 and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. The actual
sources and uses of funds may vary from the estimated sources and uses of funds set forth below. The estimated
sources and uses of funds presented below should be read in conjunction with “Summary—The Transactions,”
“Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

**Sources of funds** **Uses of funds**

**($ in millions)**
ABL Facility[(1)] ..................................... $ 500 Merger consideration[(7)] ......................... $ 5,817
Term Loan Facility[(2)] ........................... 2,300 Redemption of Existing Notes[(8)] ........... 466
Notes offered hereby[(3)] ........................ 1,800 Repayment of Existing Facilities[(9)] ....... 1,980

Termination of Swaps[(5)] ....................... 95

Cash from balance sheet[(6)] ................... 278

Total sources of funds ..................... $ 8,701 Total uses of funds ........................... $ 8,701

(1) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility,

approximately $500.0 of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger (in addition to
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date). Based on
estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately
$500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit
expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of
borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility.

(2) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $2,300.0 million (equivalent) Term Loan

Facility, comprised of a $1,750.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and a $550.0 million (equivalent) euro tranche, all
of which will be drawn at the closing of the Merger. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description
of the Term Loan Facility.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby and does not reflect the initial purchasers’

discounts and commissions, original issue discount on the notes or estimated fees and expenses related to this
offering. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay
related fees and expenses. If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Termination
Date, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

(4) Represents amounts invested directly or indirectly in equity securities of Parent by funds affiliated with or

controlled by the Sponsor and certain co-investors, which will be contributed as cash by Parent indirectly to the
Issuer. The proceeds from the Equity Contribution will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay
related fees and expenses. The actual amount of the cash Equity Contribution will depend on certain factors,


-----

such as fees and expenses, cash balances of Univar on the Merger Closing Date and the actual amount of cash
to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency swaps. For more information regarding
the equity ownership of Parent upon the closing of the Transactions, see “Summary—The Transactions,”
“Summary—Corporate Structure” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”

(5) Represents the estimated cash to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency swaps in

connection with the Merger based on the fair value of the swaps as of March 31, 2023.

(6) The actual amount of cash available as a source of funds will depend on, among other things, the cash balances

of Univar as of the Merger Closing Date.

(7) Represents the estimated aggregate Merger consideration payable to equity holders of Univar on the Merger

Closing Date.

(8) Represents the $454.0 million aggregate principal amount of Univar’s outstanding Existing Notes to be

redeemed at a redemption price equal to 102.563% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes. The final
redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest from June 1, 2023 to, but excluding, the
redemption date, which is not included in the amount set forth above. The final redemption price will vary
based on the date of redemption and accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes to the date of
redemption. See “Summary—The Transactions.”

(9) As of March 31, 2023, there was approximately $1,979.5 million outstanding under Univar’s Existing Facilities,

which will be repaid in full and terminated concurrently with the consummation of the Merger.

(10) Represents estimated transaction fees and expenses of approximately $438.0 million. Estimated transaction fees

and expenses include costs associated with the financing and other transactional fees and expenses, including
legal, accounting and other professional fees.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under Univar’s Existing
Facilities, holders of the Existing Notes and/or holders of Univar’s common stock and therefore will receive a
portion of the gross proceeds of the notes offered hereby. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the Credit Facilities and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith, and have, from time to time, performed various commercial and investment
banking and financial advisory services for us. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, is acting as Escrow Agent in connection with the Transactions and will receive customary
compensation in connection therewith. Apollo Global Securities, LLC is an affiliate of Apollo, our Sponsor, and will
receive a portion of the gross spread as an initial purchaser in the sale of the notes offered hereby. See “Plan of
Distribution” for more details.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of March 31, 2023 on an
actual basis and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. The information in this table should be
read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical
consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum. Our historical capitalization and the
adjustments necessary to arrive at the pro forma amounts below can be found under “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” in our Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
March 31, 2023.

**As of March 31, 2023**

Total stockholders’ equity (deficit)[(6)]................................................... 2,591.2 3,517.9

Total capitalization .............................................................................. $ 5,139.7 $ 8,232.9

(1) Approximately $277.7 million of cash and cash equivalents is expected to be used as a source of funds in connection with

the Transactions. The actual amount of cash and cash equivalents available as a source of funds and the remaining cash on
the balance sheet will depend on, among other things, the cash balances as of the Merger Closing Date and fees and
expenses. Actual cash and cash equivalents as of the closing date of the Transactions is expected to be approximately $100.0
million, but will vary depending on, among other things, transaction fees and expenses, the actual closing date of the
Merger, interest paid on Univar’s indebtedness prior to the closing date of the Transactions, actual prepayment penalties and
premiums in connection with the repayment in full of Univar’s existing indebtedness and changes in working capital and
operating cash flows prior to the closing date of the Transactions.

(2) Univar intends to issue a conditional notice of redemption to redeem all $454.0 million of its outstanding Existing Notes on

the Merger Closing Date at a redemption price equal to 102.563% of the principal amount of the Existing Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. To the extent that the redemption of the Existing
Notes does not occur on the Merger Closing Date, Univar expects to satisfy and discharge its obligations under the Existing
Notes, and the governing indenture, on the Merger Closing Date by depositing with the trustee under such indenture funds
sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price for the Existing Notes, including all accrued and unpaid interest, on the
scheduled redemption date. In connection with the Merger, all outstanding borrowings under Univar’s Existing Facilities
will be repaid and the commitments thereunder will be terminated.

(3) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility, approximately $500.0

million of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger (in addition to approximately $129.3 million of letters
of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date). Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately
$1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and
approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, we would have had
approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility.


-----

(4) Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we will enter into the $2,300.0 million (equivalent) Term Loan Facility, all of

which will be drawn at the closing of the Merger. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the Term
Loan Facility.

(5) Represents the principal amount of notes to be issued by the Issuer concurrently with the closing of the Merger. If the

Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

(6) As adjusted amount represents amounts invested directly or indirectly in equity securities of Parent by funds affiliated with

or controlled by our Sponsor and certain co-investors in connection with the Transactions. Total stockholders’ equity
(deficit), as adjusted, includes approximately $209.9 million of estimated transaction-related payments and share-based
compensation expense that will be immediately expensed upon closing of the Transactions.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 and the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023,
the three months ended March 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 are based on the historical consolidated audited annual and unaudited interim financial
statements of Univar included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2023. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations gives effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2022, the earliest period presented, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of operations.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023, including the historical financial data and pro forma adjustments for the Transactions, has been
calculated by subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 from the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data
for the year ended December 31, 2022, and then adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement
of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, the unaudited
condensed consolidated pro forma financial data includes all adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of the
pro formal financial information.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data has
been prepared to give effect to transactions that have occurred or are probable for which disclosure of pro forma
financial information would be material to investors, as described in the notes below.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data herein has been adjusted to depict the
accounting for the Transactions (“Transaction Accounting Adjustments”), which reflect the application of the
accounting required by GAAP, giving effect to the Merger in the historical consolidated financial statements. In
addition, pro forma adjustments have been presented related to the financing of the Merger and other material items.
Items that do not meet the classification requirements as Transaction Accounting Adjustments are shown in a
separate column entitled “Financing and Other Adjustments.” We elected not to present the reasonably estimable
cost savings, synergies, and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur
(“Management’s Adjustments”) and will only be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments and Financing and
Other Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data. See “Summary—
Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” for a discussion of Management’s
Adjustments.

Pro forma adjustments were made primarily to reflect:

    - Transaction Accounting Adjustments:

      - the Merger;

      - changes in the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities to reflect their estimated fair values
at the date of closing of the Merger, including values assigned to previously unrecognized
intangible assets and related changes in amortization expenses;

      - transaction costs and fees in connection with the Merger; and

      - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax.


-----

    - Financing and Other Adjustments relate to probable or consummated transactions that are considered
to be material to investors:

      - the Equity Contribution, the cash portion of which will be used to fund a portion of the
Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses;

      - the use of proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds from the
issuance of the notes and the proceeds from the draw on the ABL Facility to fund a portion of the
Transactions, including to repay the debt outstanding under Existing Facilities and Existing Notes
(collectively, the “Univar Existing Debt”) and to pay related fees and expenses, including changes
in interest expense resulting therefrom and amortization of estimated debt issuance costs; and

      - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are presented for informational purposes
only and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance
sheet would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily
indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Summary—
The Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
as well as the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to
our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The acquisition method of accounting requires use
of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value
as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.” The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data
presented herein, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering memorandum and
the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price
allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary asset and liability valuations. The
actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a
number of factors, including additional information available and the actual carrying value of the net assets on the
closing date of the Transactions. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and
the differences may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of purchase price, which could
affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial data, including a change to goodwill and net income. Historical and pro forma
earnings per share have not been presented because we do not believe such information is relevant to prospective
investors of the notes. Amounts included below may not add due to rounding.

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet**

(1) Represents the historical balance sheet of Univar as of March 31, 2023.

(2) Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows:

(a) Reflects the payment of (i) the Merger consideration of $5,908.7 million in cash, based on the
number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as well as payments required to be
made under the Merger Agreement on the closing date of the Merger to certain holders of
Company Equity Awards (as defined in the Merger Agreement), including $92.0 million of
reimbursed seller estimated transaction costs and (ii) the estimated transaction related payments of
approximately $150.1 million. Actual cash and cash equivalents as of the Merger Closing Date
will vary depending on, among other things, transaction fees and expenses, the actual closing date
of the Merger, interest paid on the Univar Existing Debt prior to the Merger Closing Date,
prepayment and redemption premiums and penalties in connection with the repayment in full of
the Univar Existing Debt, and changes in working capital and operating cash flows prior to the
Merger Closing Date.

(b) Reflects the preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the Merger, using the acquisition method of accounting. Given that not all final
working capital adjustments and other acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalized at
this time, the estimated purchase price used for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial data may differ materially from the final purchase price. The preliminary
allocation is summarized as follows:

**Merger Consideration**
Assumed cash consideration paid to acquire Univar equity interests

including common shares outstanding and settled Company
Equity Awards 5,816.7
Assumed reimbursed seller estimated transaction costs .................... 92.0

Other long-term liabilities ........ 381.6 — 381.6 (ii)
**Total ..............................** 2,591.2 3,269.3 5,860.5

(i) Certain vested and unvested outstanding in-the-money stock options, restricted share
awards, restricted share units, deferred share units and performance restricted share units
of Univar employees were converted into rights to receive $36.15 per share in cash
assuming the service or, in the case of certain performance-based restricted stock units,
service, market and performance conditions are satisfied. The total amount payable after
the close of the Merger in connection with such compensation awards of $115.3 million
is attributed to the services provided before and after the Merger based on service terms.
The amount attributable to the pre-acquisition service period of approximately
$67.1 million will be treated as part of the purchase consideration under the acquisition
method of accounting.

(ii) Fair value is assumed to equal carrying amount for these assets and liabilities.

(iii) Reflects the preliminary fair value adjustment relating to property, plant and equipment,
net.

(iv) Reflects the preliminary fair value adjustment relating to identifiable intangible assets.
The preliminary fair values and estimated useful lives of Univar’s identifiable intangible
assets are as follows:

**Weighted**

**Fair value** **average**
**(dollars in** **useful life**

**millions)** **(years)**

Identifiable intangible assets
Customer relationships ......................................... 3,080.0 11.4
Trade names ......................................................... 430.0 11.8
Total ........................................................... 3,510.0 11.4

As discussed above, the Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using
the acquisition method of accounting, which will establish a new basis of accounting for
all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value; however, the effects from the
application of the acquisition method of accounting relating to the acquisition of Univar,
including fair valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, are still being finalized
and are preliminary in nature. Therefore, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information included herein does not reflect the full impact of the application of
the acquisition method of accounting, including fair valuation of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, outside of a preliminary estimate of certain acquired intangible assets.


-----

Changes in the preliminary fair values disclosed herein could materially impact assets
and liabilities, including goodwill, upon finalization.

(v) Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, and primarily represents an
assembled workforce acquired and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations**

(1) Represents the historical statements of operations of Univar for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023,
the three months ended March 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended
December 31, 2022. The historical statement of operations of Univar for the twelve months ended March
31, 2023 was derived by adding the statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022
and the three months ended March 31, 2023, and subtracting the statement of operations data for the three
months ended March 31, 2022.

(2) Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows:

(a) Reflects incremental depreciation resulting from the adjustment to increase the carrying amount of
certain Univar property, plant and equipment to fair value in connection with acquisition
accounting over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.

(b) Reflects incremental amortization resulting from the adjustment of certain Univar assets to fair
value in connection with acquisition accounting, including incremental expense resulting from the
amortization of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. In addition, changes in the useful lives of
the identified intangible assets could materially impact amortization expense upon finalization. For
each 10% increase or decrease in the preliminary fair value of finite-lived intangible assets, annual
amortization expense would increase or decrease by approximately $50.5 million. Finite-lived
intangible assets are amortized using an expected benefits method of amortization.

(c) Vested and unvested outstanding in-the-money stock options were converted into rights to receive
$36.15 per share in cash, reduced by the applicable exercise price. Unvested outstanding restricted
share awards, restricted share units and deferred share units were converted into rights to receive
$36.15 per share in cash assuming the service or, in the case of certain restricted share units
subject to any performance-based vesting, service, market and performance conditions are
satisfied. The total amount payable at the close of the Merger in connection with such
compensation awards is $115.3 million, of which $67.1 million is included in purchase price
consideration. The amount attributable to the post-combination transaction period is $48.2 million,
recognized immediately in the post-acquisition period, which is included for the purposes of the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data, increasing the share-based
compensation expense recorded in the historical statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, respectively.

(d) Represents $66.1 million of transaction costs recognized on a pro forma basis in the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Such costs will be incurred or
expected to be incurred related to the Merger subsequent to March 31, 2023. These costs will not
affect the statements of operations beyond twelve months after the acquisition date.

(e) Represents a one-time sponsor transaction fee of $52.0 million on a pro forma basis during the
year ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2022 as well as ongoing
annual management fees payable to an affiliate of Apollo each quarter beginning after the close of
the Merger. The ongoing management fee of $10.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis
during the year ended December 31, 2022, $2.5 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and $10.0 million is recognized on a
pro forma basis during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

(f) A Univar blended statutory rate was used for each period presented above to reflect the estimated
tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(3) Represents the other material pro forma adjustments, giving effect to the issuance of the notes, the
borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility, the termination of derivative contracts,
including interest rate and cross currency swaps, and the repayment of the Univar Existing Debt as follows:

(a) Represents incremental interest expense related to the Term Loan Facility, ABL Facility and the
notes and commitment fees paid in connection with the ABL Facility, the non-cash amortization
of debt issuance costs and original issuance discount over the term of the related debt, the removal
of historical interest of Univar Existing Debt and financing fees and the termination of derivative
contracts:

**Total impact to pro forma interest** **$(310.2)** **$(74.0)** **$(84.6)** **$(320.8)**
**expense**

The interest rates for pro forma purposes are based on the rates assumed to be effective upon the
closing of the Transactions. The interest rate applied to the borrowings under the Credit Facilities
is based on Term SOFR (as defined elsewhere in this offering memorandum), which may cause
the interest rate estimate applied in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement
of Operations to vary, depending on fluctuations in market interest rates. After giving effect to the
Transactions, assuming $500.0 million of the ABL Facility is drawn, each 0.125% change in
assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $3.5 million change in annual
interest expense on indebtedness under the Credit Facilities. The foregoing pro forma interest
expense information does not give effect to any future hedging strategies.

(b) Reflects the incremental prepayment premium related to the repayment of the Univar Existing
Debt in conjunction with the Merger. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial data, the prepayment premium of $11.6 million was recorded within the
first fiscal quarter post-close of the Merger, based on an assumed transaction date of January 1,
2022. As such, no prepayment premium expenses were included as adjustments to the unaudited
pro forma statements of operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 or the three
months ended March 31, 2023.

(c) Represents the impact to Other (expense) income due to the termination of derivative contracts,
including the removal of $11.7 million of income on a pro forma basis during the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023, $31.1 million of income removed on a pro forma basis during the year
ended December 31, 2022, $5.0 million of expense removed on a pro forma basis during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and $14.4 million of income removed on a pro forma basis during
the three months ended March 31, 2022.

(d) A Univar blended statutory rate was used for each period presented above to reflect the estimated
tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**
**OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers periods_
_prior to the consummation of the Transactions, except for the “Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about_
_Market Risk” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources Following the Transactions” subsections. Accordingly, the_
_discussion and analysis of historical periods does not reflect the impact that the Transactions will have on us. You_
_should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the_
_financial statements and related notes included in this offering memorandum. This discussion contains forward-_
_looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in_
_the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum. Actual results may differ materially from those contained_
_in any forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this_
_management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “we,” “our,” “us” and_
_“the Company” refer to Univar and its consolidated subsidiaries before giving effect to the consummation of the_
_Transactions._

**Overview**

Univar Solutions Inc. is a leading global solutions provider to users of specialty ingredients and chemicals
and provider of value-added services to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals
and ingredients from thousands of producers worldwide and warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport and sell
them to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120 countries.

Our operations are structured into four reportable segments that represent the geographic areas under which
we operate and manage our business. Our segments are USA, EMEA, Canada and LATAM, which includes
developing businesses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Results**

**_Acquisitions and Divestitures_**

In February 2023, we acquired ChemSol Group, a leading ingredients and specialty chemical distributor in
Central America.

In July 2022, we acquired Vicom, a leading regional specialty chemicals distributor in Spain and Portugal.

In December 2021, we acquired Sweetmix, a food ingredients and CASE specialty chemical distribution
company in Brazil.

In April 2021, we sold the Distrupol business within our EMEA segment. The sale of this business did not
meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

See “Note 3: Business combinations” and “Note 4: Dispositions” to our audited consolidated financial
statements and “Note 2: Business combinations” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information regarding the acquisitions and
divestiture noted above.

**_Constant Currency_**

We believe providing information on a non-GAAP constant currency basis offers valuable supplemental
information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. Currency impacts
on consolidated and segment results have been derived by translating current period financial results in local
currency using the average exchange rate for the prior period to which the financial information is being compared.

89


-----

**Inflation Reduction Act**

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into US law. Effective for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2022, the IRA imposes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on share
repurchases, and creates and extends certain tax-related energy incentives. The tax-related provisions of the IRA do
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**Market Conditions**

We market and sell commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients that are used in manufacturing
processes and as components in other products. Our sales are correlated with and affected by seasonal fluctuations
and cycles in the levels of industrial production, manufacturing output and general economic activity. The current
business environment in the markets in which we operate consists of complex dynamics that can change rapidly.
Over the last several years, a combination of factors has impacted and disrupted global trade flows, which has
resulted in dynamic and inflationary pricing conditions, in various end markets and geographies.

Starting in late 2022, we began to see an abatement of significant disruption within supply chains, as well
as monetary policy changes designed to increase the cost of capital and rein in inflation. These changes have put
downward pressure on demand as customers throughout the value chain reduce inventory positions in favor of larger
cash positions. Despite the downward pressure in demand, we continue to see strength in one of our core value
propositions, which is to de-risk supply chains for our customers and suppliers.

In such a dynamic environment, we are focused on connectivity with our customers and supply base to
better understand demand and supply impacts on their operations. We believe our value as a distributor has grown
over the past several years as we have demonstrated reliability, consistency, and security of supply. We work to
meet demand requirements through our extensive network, installed asset base, transportation and digital assets, and
supplier partnerships, supported by our network of solution centers and technically-trained professionals with deep
industry knowledge.

A summary of our sales channel and underlying end market performance as of March 31, 2023, with
corresponding impacts from the current environment are as follows (percentages represent 2023 first quarter
consolidated net sales):

_Chemicals and Services (67%) - Within our Chemicals and Services sales channel, we continue to see_
resilient growth in inorganic chemistries as well as our Energy and Mining markets. We have a focus on expanding
our role in Municipal and Industrial Water treatment, with a wide array of chemistries and services designed to help
manage and purify water. In our core chemical distribution, we are seeing lower demand in product sales; however,
cost and pricing remains higher as the prior period inflation is entrenched in the supply chain. We are seeing pockets
of increased demand in select end markets tied to electric vehicle and green energy production.

_Ingredients and Specialties (33%) - Our Ingredients and Specialties sales channel has experienced the_
impacts of a decline in consumer demand, particularly within Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants, and Elastomers and
Personal Care, as customers react to lower demand, a need to destock existing inventories, and some deflationary
pressures. We are encouraged by our Pharma and Lubricants businesses as we drive ongoing business activity with
the support of our formulations lab and technically focused sales strategy. In Food, we are seeing the benefits of our
specialty ingredients focus, despite the volatility in certain pricing categories. In Household and Industrial Cleaning,
we are beginning to see the return of the automotive care industry as pricing normalization returns.

A summary of our sales channel and underlying end market performance as of December 31, 2022, with
corresponding impacts from the current environment are as follows (percentages represent 2022 consolidated net
sales):

_Chemicals and Services (66%) - Our Chemicals and Services sales channel saw strong growth over the_
course of the year with many of the core industries seeing accelerated demand and resilient pricing. Our continued
focus on putting the customer at the center of all we do has led to above-market growth in chemical manufacturing,

mining and energy. Our complete offering of water treatment chemistries allows us to provide both municipalities
and industrial customers with solutions for managing and purifying water. We are beginning to accelerate our
offerings into the North American electronics market, with high-purity chemistries necessary for manufacturing
microchips. Additionally, we saw growth in agricultural chemistries, pulp and paper and in general manufacturing.
Our services business had top-line growth as we improved our service capabilities and we saw a slight rebound in
automotive manufacturing. The recent rise in interest rates causes us some concern that global industrial production
decline may dampen the demand for our products; however, we anticipate a higher value on increased carrying costs
of working capital.

_Ingredients and Specialties (34%) - Our Ingredients and Specialties sales channel saw strong growth_
throughout the year in both our end markets as well as in a number of our differentiated chemistries. We saw
particularly strong growth in our Pharmaceuticals business, which has continued to grow since the pandemic on
increasing demand for high-purity actives, excipients and other necessary ingredients. Our food ingredients business
saw strength throughout the year on security of supply and a partnership with our suppliers and customers to provide
solutions that cater to consumer trends. Our beauty and personal care business saw another year of growth on
product management and new supplier authorizations. Within our CASE business, we saw product tightness and
inflation for much of the year. The slowdown in housing construction resulting from higher interest rates during the
back half of the year dampened demand; however, our service performance and product offering allowed for topline growth. The lubricants and metalworking business finished the year with market share gain as well as margin
expansion on good pricing discipline. Finally, the homecare and industrial cleaning business finished the year with
sales growth on pricing discipline and further supplier development.

**Executive Summary**

Driven by agile commercial execution, chemical price inflation and growing customer demand, Univar
Solutions delivered strong year-over-year growth despite constrained inventory and supply and transportation
challenges. With the Nexeo acquisition integration and system migration completed, we look to continue to leverage
our digital investments to drive organic growth through market share capture and margin gains through leverage of
our cost structure.

Management is focused on the following financial objectives:

    - growth above consensus GDP;

    - consolidated Reported Adjusted EBITDA growth and corresponding Reported Adjusted EBITDA
margin expansion;

    - increased return on invested capital;

    - maintaining targeted leverage levels; and

    - growing inorganically through bolt-on acquisitions.

Achievement of these objectives is expected through the following operational initiatives:

    - application of a consistent global strategy, while driving local execution;

    - leverage of our global transportation and digital asset footprint;

    - solutions to support suppliers’ and customers’ ESG objectives;

    - delivery of an effortless experience for customers that drives preference and retention;

    - focus on technical and application development offerings;

-----

    - unlocking our global solution centers’ value for suppliers and customers;

    - leverage and expansion of our key supplier relationships, with the goal of enhancing service to key
global customers;

    - capitalize on U.S. re-industrialization and near-shoring trends; and

    - execute accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities in regions and markets where we believe there are
synergistic opportunities for growth, cross-selling and cost rationalization.

The Company believes that its results for the first quarter of 2023, which were impacted by destocking, are
illustrative of quarterly expectations for the remainder of the year before giving effect to cost savings and announced
acquisitions. The Company’s cost savings initiatives for the year ending December 31, 2023 are underway and are
expected to be achieved in the second half of the year. In addition, the impact of destocking as a result of supply
chain disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 has generally abated in the second quarter of
2023. Furthermore, the trend of higher volumes during the summer months is expected to impact our working
capital requirements in line with historical norms.

**_Other expense_**

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased $11.0 million, or 49.5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily
due to higher average interest rates on floating rate debt. Refer to “Note 7: Debt” in our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

_Other (expense) income, net_

Other (expense) income, net changed $14.1 million, or 183.1%, from income of $7.7 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 to expense of $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Refer to
“Note 5: Supplemental financial information” in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense was $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, resulting in an effective
income tax rate of 23.3%. Income tax expense was $64.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022,
resulting in an effective income tax rate of 26.4%.

Our 2023 and 2022 effective income tax rates were higher than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%,
primarily due to higher rates on foreign earnings, US tax on foreign earnings, US state income taxes, and nondeductible employee costs.

**Results of Reportable Business Segments**

Our operations are structured into four reportable segments that represent the geographic areas under which
we operate and manage our business. These segments are USA, EMEA, Canada, and LATAM, which includes
developing businesses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Management believes Reported Adjusted
EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance, which is used as the primary basis for the chief
operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments.

We believe certain other financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP provide
relevant and meaningful information concerning our ongoing operating results. These financial measures include
gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), gross margin, and Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin. Such non-GAAP
financial measures are referred to from time to time in this report, but should not be viewed as a substitute for
GAAP measures of performance and should be considered along with the comparable GAAP measures. See “Note
14: Segments” in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, “Analysis of Segment Results” and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information.

higher average interest rates on floating rate debt. Refer to “Note 11: Debt” in our audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

_Gain on sale of business_

Gain on sale of business was $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the sale
of our Distrupol business and also included adjustments to the sale price of the Canadian Agriculture services
business. Refer to “Note 4: Dispositions” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum for additional information.

_Other income, net_

100


-----

elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense was $210.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in an effective
income tax rate of 27.9%. Our effective income tax rate was higher than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%,
primarily due to higher rates on foreign earnings, US tax on foreign earnings, US state income taxes and nondeductible employee costs.

Income tax expense was $124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in an effective
income tax rate of 21.3%. Our effective income tax rate was higher than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%
primarily due to higher rates on foreign earnings, US tax on foreign earnings, US state income taxes and nondeductible employee costs offset by the favorable impact of the Distrupol divestiture.

**Results of Reportable Business Segments**

Our operations are structured into four reportable segments that represent the geographic areas under which
we operate and manage our business. These segments are USA, EMEA, Canada and LATAM, which includes
developing businesses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Management believes Reported Adjusted
EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance, which is used as the primary basis for the chief
operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments.

We believe certain other financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP provide
relevant and meaningful information concerning our ongoing operating results. These financial measures include
gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), gross margin and Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin. Such non-GAAP
financial measures are referred to from time to time in this report but should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
measures of performance and should be considered along with the comparable GAAP measures. See “Note 20:
Segments” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for
additional information, “Analysis of Segment Results” of this offering memorandum and “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” of this offering memorandum for additional information.

**Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operations and
borrowings under its committed Senior ABL Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2023, liquidity for the Company was
$1,147.6 million, comprised of $377.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $769.9 million of available
borrowings under its credit facility. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries and secured
by such parties’ eligible accounts receivable, inventory and cash with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.6
billion. Significant reductions in our accounts receivable, inventory and cash would reduce our availability to access
liquidity under the credit facility. We have no active financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreements;
however, there is a springing fixed charge coverage ratio (“FCCR”) under the revolving credit facility of 1.0x,
applicable only if availability is less than or equal to 10% of the borrowing capacity. If the FCCR was applicable,
the calculation would have been 5.0x as of March 31, 2023.

Our primary short-term liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance operating expenses, working
capital, capital expenditures, other liabilities including environmental remediation and interest, possible business
acquisitions, share repurchases and general corporate purposes. The majority of our debt obligations mature in 2026
and beyond. To the extent that our cash balances from time to time exceed amounts that are needed to fund our
immediate liquidity requirements, we will consider alternative uses of some or all of such excess cash. Such
alternatives may include, among others, the redemption or repurchase of debt securities or other borrowings through
open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Refer to “Note 11: Debt” in our audited
consolidated financial statements and “Note 7: Debt” in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information related to our debt obligations.
Management continues to balance its focus on sales and earnings growth with continuing efforts in cost control and
working capital management.

Access to debt capital markets has historically provided the Company with sources of liquidity beyond
normal operating cash flows. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the
future with our history of favorable results in the debt capital markets and strong relationships with global financial
institutions. However, our ability to continue to access the debt capital markets with favorable interest rates and
other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on maintaining our current ratings assigned by the credit rating
agencies.

We may from time to time refinance or take steps to reduce debt or interest costs. The amount of debt, if
any, that may be reduced or refinanced will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash
position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. On October 27, 2022, we entered into the
Second Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (“Senior ABL Facility”), which provided a five-year senior
secured ABL credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion and a five-year senior secured term loan
facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Senior ABL Facility amends and restates in full the
amended and restated ABL facility entered into by the Company on February 28, 2019. In connection with the entry
into the Senior ABL Facility, the Company terminated its existing European ABL Credit Agreement and the Euro
ABL Facility thereunder.

Our defined benefit pension plans had an underfunded status of $82.7 million and $122.3 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on current projections and minimum funding requirements, we
expect to make cash contributions of $16.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2023. The amount and
timing of any such requirement in future years is uncertain given the implicit uncertainty regarding the future
developments of factors described in “Risk Factors”.

We expect our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2023 to be approximately $155
million to $165 million for maintenance and growth, including safety, cost improvements and ESG investments. We
expect to fund our capital expenditures for the foreseeable future with cash from operations or cash on hand.

Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately
$154 million (56% of which related to maintenance and 44% of which related to growth), $111 million (55% of
which related to maintenance and 45% of which related to growth) and $111 million (64% of which related to
maintenance and 36% of which related to growth), respectively.

We believe funds provided by our primary sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity, debt
repayment obligation and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions.

**Cash Flows**

**_Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2022_**

Net cash used by investing activities (51.4) (34.5)

Net cash provided by financing activities 38.9 170.8

_Operating Activities_

Cash used by operating activities decreased $131.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to the timing of changes in trade working capital, partially offset by lower net income,
exclusive of non-cash items, and the other, net cash flow item.

Cash used by trade working capital, which includes trade accounts receivable, net, inventories, and trade
accounts payable, decreased $263.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three
months ended March 31, 2022. The year-over-year decrease in cash used by trade working capital was due to a
favorable change in trade accounts receivable, net related to the timing of sales and cash collections and a favorable
change in inventories related to the timing of purchases, partially offset by an increase in cash used by trade
accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments.

The change in net income, exclusive of non-cash items, decreased $121.4 million from $261.6 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $140.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cash used by
other, net increased $48.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2022, primarily attributable to accrued compensation and timing differences related to other assets
and liabilities.

Net cash used by financing activities ................................................................. (232.7) (424.6)

_Operating Activities_

Cash provided by operating activities increased $256.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily due to higher net income, exclusive of non-cash items, and the timing of changes in trade
working capital, partially offset by the other, net cash flow item.

The change in net income, exclusive of non-cash items, increased $274.7 million from $500.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to $775.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash used by other, net
increased $180.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to tax payments, accrued
compensation and timing differences related to other assets and liabilities.

Cash used by trade working capital, which includes trade accounts receivable, net, inventories and trade
accounts payable, decreased $139.3 million as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in cash used
by trade working capital was due to a favorable change in trade accounts receivable, net related to the timing of sales
and cash collections, partially offset by an unfavorable change in trade accounts payable primarily attributable to the
timing of inventory purchases and payments.

_Investing Activities_

We monitor the results of our reportable segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about
resource allocation and performance assessment, and evaluate performance using Reported Adjusted EBITDA.
Additionally, the Company uses Reported Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align
management compensation measurement with operational performance.

We define Reported Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of consolidated net income; depreciation; amortization;
net interest expense; income tax expense; impairment charges; (gain) loss on sale of business; other operating
expenses, net and other (expense) income, net (for both, see “Note 8: Supplemental financial information” in our
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional
information). For 2020, Reported Adjusted EBITDA also included an adjustment to remove a Brazil VAT charge.
See below for a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to
Reported Adjusted EBITDA.

We believe other financial measures, as defined below, that do not comply with GAAP provide relevant
and meaningful information concerning the ongoing and future operating results of the Company.

    - Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation): net sales less cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation);

    - Gross margin: gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) divided by external sales on a segment level and
by net sales on a consolidated level; and

    - Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin: Reported Adjusted EBITDA divided by external sales on a
segment level and by net sales on a consolidated level.

We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant
currency presentation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. We believe providing information on a constant currency basis provides valuable
supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We
calculate constant currency percentages and other information by converting our financial results in local currency
for a period using the average exchange rate for the prior period to which we are comparing.

The non-GAAP financial measures noted above are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should
not be considered a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance
with GAAP. They are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management
believes these non-GAAP financial measures help investors’ ability to analyze underlying trends in the Company’s
business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in its industry and provide useful information to both
management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating
results. Additionally, other companies may calculate Reported Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its
usefulness as a comparative measure.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources Following the Transactions**

**_Overview_**

We expect that the Transactions will require total cash of approximately $8,701 million, which will be used
to fund the Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.” We expect the cash
requirements of the Transactions to be financed through the net proceeds from this offering, proceeds from our
Credit Facilities, the Equity Contribution and cash from the balance sheet of Univar. On a pro forma basis giving
effect to the Transactions, assuming cash and cash equivalents of Univar as of the closing of the Merger of
approximately $377.7 million, we would have had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $100.0 million
immediately after the closing of the Transactions. The actual amount of cash available as a source of funds for the
Transactions and post-closing will depend on, among other things, transaction fees and expenses, the actual closing
date of the Merger, the actual amount of cash to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency
swaps, interest paid on the Company’s indebtedness prior to the closing date of the Transactions, actual prepayment
penalties and premiums in connection with the repayment in full of the Company’s existing indebtedness and
changes in working capital and operating cash flows prior to the closing date of the Transactions. We believe that
our cash on hand and availability under the ABL Facility will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses in the
near term. We expect that other sources of cash required to pay our operating expenses for the remainder of 2023
will consist of cash flows provided by our operations and available borrowings under the ABL Facility. Based on
estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately
$500.0 million expected to be drawn and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be
outstanding, each as of the closing date of the Transactions, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of
borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions.

Upon completion of this offering, our long-term debt for borrowed money will be comprised of the notes
and indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.

After the consummation of the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity will be cash on the balance
sheet, cash generated by operations and borrowings under the ABL Facility. Our primary uses of cash after the
consummation of the Transactions will be working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital
expenditures. Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flows from
operations, combined with availability under the ABL Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current
obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending requirements
over the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL
Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on prevailing economic conditions, many of which are beyond our
control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control, we could be required to
repay or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness,
including the Credit Facilities and the notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions,
joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital, and there can be no assurance that
any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be highly levered. On a pro forma basis giving effect
to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2023, we would have had outstanding $4,600.0 million in aggregate
indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding capital and financing leases), with approximately $677.9 million
available for borrowing under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing base

110


-----

availability of approximately $1,307.2 million, approximately $500.0 expected to be drawn as of the closing date
and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date). Our liquidity
requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt service requirements. On a pro forma basis giving effect to
the Transactions, our cash interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 would have been
approximately $393.6 million. Assuming the ABL Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended
interest rates would result in an approximately $4.6 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under
the Credit Facilities. The foregoing pro forma interest expense information does not give effect to any future
hedging strategies.

From time to time, depending upon market and other conditions, as well as upon our cash balances and
liquidity, we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may acquire our outstanding debt securities or our other indebtedness
through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such
terms and at such prices as we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the
indentures, if applicable), for cash or other consideration.

**_The Credit Facilities_**

_The ABL Facility_

In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the ABL Facility with aggregate commitments of
$1,400.0 million with a maturity of five years, approximately $500.0 million of which we expect to be drawn at
closing (in addition to approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing
date).

The ABL Facility will contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. The negative
covenants in the ABL Facility will include, among other things, limitations (none of which are absolute) on our
ability to: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) create liens on certain assets; (iii) make
certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); (iv) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our
capital stock or make other restricted payments; (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of our assets; (vi) sell assets; (vii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; (viii) enter into
sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change our lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict
liens; (xi) change our fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements. For a
description of the ABL Facility, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility.”

_The Term Loan Facility_

In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal
amount of $2,300.0 million (equivalent), comprised of a $1,750.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and a $550.0 million
(equivalent) euro tranche, with a maturity of seven years, all of which will be borrowed on the closing date of the
Transactions.

The Term Loan Facility will contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. The
negative covenants in the Term Loan Facility will include, among other things, limitations (none of which are
absolute) on our ability to: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) create liens on certain
assets; (iii) make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); (iv) pay dividends on or make distributions in
respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; (v) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of our assets; (vi) sell assets; (vii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; (viii) enter
into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change our lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or
restrict liens; (xi) change our fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements. For
a description of the Term Loan Facility, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term Loan Facility.”

**_Notes Offered Hereby_**

The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, and the
ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) create liens on

111


-----

certain assets; (iii) make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); (iv) pay dividends on or make
distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; (v) consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; (vi) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and
(vii) restrict dividends from our subsidiaries.

These limitations are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions that will be set forth in the
indenture governing the notes. See “Description of Notes.”

**Pro Forma Contractual Obligations**

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2023 after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions:


**Less than**

**1 year** **1-3 years** **3-5 years**


**Greater than**

**5 years** **Total**

(1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and notes. Principal payments on debt are calculated

based on contractual maturities as of March 31, 2023.

(2) Represents the cash interest amount of the ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and notes. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future

periods using projected interest rates and contractual maturities as of March 31, 2023.

(3) Commitments related to multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations and acquisitions.

(4) This table excludes our defined benefit pension contributions. Based on current projections and minimum funding requirements, we expect

to make cash contributions of $16.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans in the year ending December 31, 2023.

We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we
believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe that such routine
commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described
in “Note 2: Significant accounting policies” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum for additional information. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if that
estimate requires that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make that
estimate and if different estimates that we could reasonably have used or changes in accounting estimates that are
reasonably likely to occur could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. The accounting assumptions
and estimates discussed below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial
statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. By their nature, these judgments
and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

112


-----

**_Goodwill_**

Total goodwill as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,288.2 million and $2,310.4 million, respectively.
We perform an annual goodwill impairment assessment at the reporting unit level each year as of October 1, or more
frequently if potential impairment indicators exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors
to assess the likelihood of an impairment. A reporting unit’s carrying value used in an impairment test represents the
assignment of various assets and liabilities, including corporate allocations, based on the enterprise approach.

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other
relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a
quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used
in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value.

Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a
reporting unit’s fair value. Significant assumptions include forecasted EBITDA, market segment growth rates and
discount rates based on a reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions,
estimates or judgments could significantly impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore impact a
reporting unit’s fair value in excess of carrying value assessment.

Through qualitative assessments performed on the USA, EMEA, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific
reporting units, we concluded that it was more likely than not that each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its
carrying value. As such, a quantitative assessment was not performed for any of our reporting units. No goodwill
impairment losses were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.

**_Environmental Liabilities_**

We recognize environmental liabilities for probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with
environmental remediation. The estimated environmental liability includes incremental direct costs of investigations,
remediation efforts and post-remediation monitoring. Total environmental liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021
were $90.9 million and $88.1 million, respectively. See “Note 18: Commitments and contingencies” in our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

Our environmental liabilities are subject to numerous uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate our
costs, or our share of costs if multiple parties are responsible. These uncertainties involve the legal, regulatory and
enforcement parameters governing environmental assessment and remediation, the nature and extent of
contamination at the sites, the extent and cost of assessment and remediation efforts required, our insurance
coverage for the sites and, in the case of sites with multiple responsible parties, the number and financial strength of
those parties. In addition, our determination as to whether a loss is probable may change, particularly as new facts
emerge as to the causes of contamination. We evaluate each environmental site as new information and facts
become available and make adjustments to accruals based upon our assessment of these factors, using technical
experts, legal counsel and other specialists.

**_Defined Benefit Pension Plans_**

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the US and other countries. The valuation for these plans
depends on assumptions made by management, which are used by actuaries we engage to calculate the projected and
accumulated benefit obligations and the annual expense recognized for the plans. Significant assumptions include
discount rates and expected rate of return on plan assets. Changes in assumptions and plan experience result in the
recognition of gains and losses in earnings, as our accounting policy is to recognize changes in the fair value of plan
assets and projected benefit obligation in the fourth quarter of each year (the “mark to market” adjustment), unless
an earlier remeasurement is required. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded mark to market
gains of $17.2 million and $75.9 million, respectively. See “Note 12: Employee benefit plans” in our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information.

113


-----

Changes in the assumed discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following
effects:

**Increase (decrease) in**


**2022 Projected**
**benefit obligation**


**(in millions)** **Change**


**2023 Net**
**benefit cost**


Discount rate....................................................... 100 bps decrease $ (2.5) $ 99.8
Discount rate....................................................... 100 bps increase 1.7 (87.9)
Expected rate of return on plan assets ................ 100 bps decrease 5.0 N/A
Expected rate of return on plan assets ................ 100 bps increase (4.4) N/A

**_Income Taxes_**

We are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we sell products and earn revenues. We record
income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
A reduction of the carrying values of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to realize
deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past
operating results, forecasted and appropriate character of future taxable income, the duration of statutory
carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and
feasible tax strategies. We have a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, primarily related to foreign tax
credits and net operating loss carry forwards. We account for unrecognized tax benefits through an assessment of
whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on its
technical merits. We record liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

**BUSINESS**

**Company Overview**

We are a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as
a provider of value-added services, to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase
chemicals and ingredients from thousands of producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute,
transport, and sell those materials safely to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120
countries.

Our go-to-market approach focuses on leveraging the scale of our operations and our local industry
and geographic knowledge to create differentiated value for our customers and suppliers. This is primarily
achieved through our Chemicals & Services (“C&S”) channel, through which we can leverage the scale of our
operations and is intensely focused on customer service, and our Ingredients & Specialties (“I&S”) channel,
which focuses on specialty chemicals and ingredients paired with in-depth technical expertise. This dualchannel approach allows us to meet the specific needs of each customer across their entire product
development, commercialization, and raw material purchasing journey, creating value across the entire
customer production chain. Our C&S channel features a broad portfolio of commodity products and we
believe that our focus on customer service in this business channel allows us to gain a competitive advantage
over other players operating in the market. Our I&S channel leverages the breadth of our supplier and
customer relationships and a technically focused sales process aimed at achieving new authorizations and
customer and volume retention.

We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, including
approximately 9,700 employees and 600 facilities, supported by the largest private transportation fleet in the
industry: approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers; and approximately 2,500 railcars, 120 rail and
barge terminals and 20 deep sea terminals, focused on timely and safe delivery to a spectrum of customers,
large and small. With our global sales force, a vast supplier network, unparalleled logistics know-how, deep
market and regulatory knowledge, world-class formulation and recipe development, and industry-leading
digital tools, we are committed to helping customers and suppliers anticipate and navigate today’s challenges
and capture the meaningful growth opportunities that exist in their industries.

Beyond traditional distribution services, our value-added services include e-commerce, digital
marketing, chemical waste management, on-site storage, packaging, private label and technical application
and formulation support for industries such as Beauty and Personal Care, Food, Pharma, CASE, Lubricants
and Metalworking, Homecare and Industrial Cleaning, Agricultural, Water Treatment, and Electronics. Our
scale, along with our dense logistics network, long-standing regulatory permits, exclusive product offering of
premier brands, centralized business technology infrastructure, industry-leading safety record, and valueadded services, along with established relationships with the leading chemicals and ingredients producers in
our industry allow us to meet the end market, technical development, and material supply needs of our
customers, while serving as an extension of our premier suppliers. This approach allows us to execute an
intense focus on service, while lowering costs.

While the global chemical distribution industry is large and highly fragmented, with thousands of
distributors, it represents a relatively small portion of all chemical industry sales. While the total chemical and
ingredient industry is projected to grow at rates close to the gross national product of the countries in which
we operate around the world, the distributed chemicals portion of the industry is projected to grow at a faster
rate as producers and customers increasingly realize the economic benefits of this channel. Suppliers rely on
us to warehouse, repackage, transport, market and sell their products as a way to expand their industry access,
enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase
products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their
chemical and ingredient sourcing process through access to just-in-time delivery, excellent product
availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe
and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals fully compliant with increasing local and federal regulations.

115


-----

Chemical distributors play an essential role within the global chemical and ingredient value chain by
providing customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals that create value-added products. While
certain chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also
thousands of smaller, regional customers who may be more economically served by distributors given their
more “local” reach and last-mile expertise.

**_Products and End Markets_**

We source and inventory commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such
as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads directly from producers and break down the bulk quantities to
repackage, market, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.

In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our
transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous
materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our
customers. We also have state-of-the-art solution centers at locations across the globe, consisting of
formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and
innovative technical capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product
development cycles. Each of these locations is staffed by a team of chemists and food scientists, many with
doctorate-level educations. At the heart of our business model are our highly trained professionals with deep
industry experience within the specific markets they serve.

We serve a diverse set of end markets and regions, with no end market accounting for more than 18%
of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The following charts illustrate the geographical
and end market diversity of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022:

**By Geography[(a)]** **By End Market**

(a) Based on internal management studies.

We maintain strong, long-term relationships with our producers and our customers, some of which
span decades. We source materials from thousands of suppliers around the globe, including premier brands
from world-class producers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our ten largest producers accounted
for approximately 41% of our total purchases. Similarly, we sell products to thousands of customers globally,
ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to large corporate accounts. For the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 6% of our sales.

**_Our Channels_**

Our product portfolio is offered across two channels – C&S and I&S. We offer more than 15,000
products to a broad range of end markets across both the C&S and I&S channels.

_C&S. Our C&S product portfolio primarily includes a wide range of organic and inorganic_
chemistries, surfactants, inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout
most end markets. C&S products are typically sold in higher volumes and we believe that our success in C&S
has been enabled by our ‘customer centric’ selling model, coupled with our facility, transportation and digital
asset bases, and our extensive supplier partnerships. We operate a global business, featuring the largest
chemical distribution network in both the U.S. and Canada, as well as scaled platforms in Europe and Latin
America where we were the second and fifth largest distributor by sales, respectively, in each case in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022. We are intensely focused on customer service and satisfaction which leads to
high levels of customer retention, as well as extensive product expertise across our portfolio.

We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the
market and allow us to compete across our end markets:

    - we operate an expansive North American site network and approximately 80% of our U.S.

manufacturing GDP is located within a 60-minute drive time from one or more of our facilities;

    - we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and maintain appropriate inventory levels

throughout the year to ensure security of supply to our customers;

    - we have invested in a strong digital platform that allows us to identify orders, target customers,

access real-time pricing information and ensure the availability of freight-logical product where
and when it is needed;

    - we offer competitive pricing for our products while delivering attractive levels of profitability; and

    - we are contracted and work closely with the leading suppliers in the industry and maintain an

expert sales force with deep ties to customers to market and sell their product into the market.

We have established clear goals within our C&S channel. We are targeting organic growth of over 100
basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 22% over the next three to five years.

We also have clear strategic priorities for C&S to ensure we continue to gain share within our core
markets and continue our track record of delivering strong growth, including:

    - execution of strategic capital investments to ensure high levels of service, improved safety and
the ability to maximize growth in a dynamic market;

    - continuing to compete successfully at the local level with global scale, matching the intensity of
our more regional competitors with our advantageous size and scale; and

    - remaining “Easy to Do Business With” for our customers and suppliers as a trusted distributor in
our industry.

_I&S. Our Ingredients and Specialties channel serves a more value added, higher-growth portion of the_
market tailored to specific end market requirements. For each I&S market, we have dedicated sales, marketing,
product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of the markets they serve. We

117


-----

represent approximately 500 strategic specialty and ingredient chemical suppliers and sell their portfolios to
approximately 42,000 customer locations around the world. These specialty products are typically sold in lower
volumes, but at a higher gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), than commodity products. These products
also tend to provide “sticky” business as they become vital components to customers’ procurement needs.

In I&S, sustained growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce effectiveness, delivering solutions
through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our comprehensive supply chain
infrastructure. I&S focuses on seven global markets and is serviced through our Life Sciences (Beauty &
Personal Care, Food Ingredients and Pharmaceutical Ingredients) and Industrial Solutions (CASE, Homecare
& Industrial Cleaning and Lubricant & Metalworking Fluids) businesses.

We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the
market and allow us to compete across our customer and end markets:

    - strong formulation know-how and application laboratories to innovate with customers, including
through our industry-leading laboratory capabilities;

    - ability to meet our customers’ needs with a comprehensive product portfolio and industry focus
sales, marketing and product management;

    - reliable “on time in full” delivery and supply assurance, underpinned by strong relationships
between customers and company service representatives; and

    - partnerships with high-quality suppliers and brands with high-quality products across end
markets, including securing exclusive relationships for premium parts of our portfolio where we
operate symbiotically with our suppliers.

We have established clear goals within our I&S channel. We are targeting organic growth at over 200
basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 28% over the next three to five years.

To achieve these financial objectives, our key strategic priorities include:

    - dedicated industry and sub-market focus through sales, product management, marketing, and
regulatory capabilities to deliver relevant support to customers and suppliers;

    - leading technical capabilities through our global solution center network and application
development experts, drawing on deep resources across inventory and logistics experts,
scientists, PhDs, procurement, customer service, sales and marketers to deliver consultative
services and an unmatched portfolio to solve customers’ formulation and operational challenges;
and

    - continued expansion of our specialty product portfolio and market penetration through organic
and inorganic growth.

**Our Mission**

We believe that we are well positioned to drive profitable growth, increase our market share and
capitalize on industry outsourcing trends by focusing on our key initiatives to Streamline, Innovate, and Grow.

_Streamline. We are committed to continuously improving our operating performance and lowering_
our costs per transaction. In particular, we seek to:

    - align our business teams with identified growth opportunities in customer end markets, product
markets, services, and industries in a way that narrows focus and increases accountability;

    - increase our use of digital tools to simplify tasks, lower costs and improve customer experience;

    - continue to use Lean Six Sigma methodologies to deliver project-by-project productivity gains;

    - increase the cost efficiency of our warehouses, terminals, tank farms and logistics, and improve
our net working capital efficiency;

    - deliver a compelling customer value proposition by providing simplified sourcing, cost effective
just-in-time delivery and managed inventory along with value-added services; and

    - continue to build on our industry leading safety performance, and sustainability initiatives as a

119


-----

differentiator with both customers and producers.

We have identified significant incremental opportunities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs
throughout the organization. The five key areas to be targeted span across: (1) Organization, general and
administration; (2) Fleet & logistics Improvement; (3) Procurement; (4) Go-to-Market strategy; and (5)
Warehouse improvement & commercial efficiencies. Between approximately $114 and $211 million of cost
saving opportunities have been identified by an independent third-party study, approximately $40 million of
which was already announced to the market in 2022 by Univar as a part of the Value Capture program. We are
estimating that we will be able to achieve an additional $75 million of cost savings above previous 2023
targets and believe this will take between 12 and 18 months to realize with one-time implementation costs of
approximately $37 million.

_Innovate. We intend to deliver our digital transformation by combining the most advanced ERP and_
smart asset “Internet of Things” technology. We intend to enrich the customer and supplier experience with
market leading tools and quality processes that will further separate us from our competitors. We expect that
our superior market intelligence and analytics capabilities will allow us to predict trends and lead innovations.

We believe our digital expertise will help us deliver end-to-end supply chain solutions, from our
suppliers’ manufacturing facilities right through to our customers’ machines, allowing us to work as an
extension of their teams and networks to create a whole new level of new ecosystem for our industry.

We believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth and increased operational efficiency by
orchestrating a multi- year digital transformation by:

    - continuing to introduce new, innovative digital solutions that enhance our customer experience
and drive stronger customer preference and customer loyalty, thereby increasing the lifetime
value of customers;

    - expanding our offering of digital solutions and bolstering our leadership position in the industry;

    - leveraging new digital solutions to enhance the experience of our supplier partners, improving
their market reach and penetration and providing valuable market insights through data analytics;

    - digitizing our distribution network, thereby creating a more agile, transparent supply chain,
resulting in improved capabilities and efficiency; and

    - empowering our employees with valuable, timely insights resulting in better decisions, and
automating administrative functions in order to enhance employee productivity.

We have built a global network of world-class solutions centers. These state-of-the-art labs and test
kitchens perform a variety of services including performance testing, failure analysis, quality assurance, recipe
development, and formulation development. Our chemists, food scientists, chefs and experienced formulation
experts help customers innovate their products from concept to commercialization across a wide range of
industries and applications. Our technical team comprises both lab-based and field-based experts, many with
doctorate and other advanced degrees in their scientific field.

_Grow. We believe our initiatives will allow us to outperform competitors, leading to market share_
gains. We will continue to streamline and enhance our customer experience in order to be the most customerfriendly distributor to do business with and to increase customer preference for Univar Solutions. In addition,
we believe our industry-focused go-to-market strategy combined with innovative sales and marketing support
and strong customer preference will lead to winning additional product authorizations from suppliers. In
particular, we seek to:

    - further develop a highly skilled and well-equipped sales force utilizing a value-based
consultative sales approach that is aligned to customer and end market needs by geography,
product, service and industry specialization;

    - continue to increase our technical and industry-specific product and market expertise;

    - develop a world-class marketing capability to dynamically identify and align resources with
high-growth, high value opportunities;

120


-----

    - cultivate and maintain long-term producer relationships through deep market and product
knowledge, value-based selling, reduced complexity in distribution channels and offering
complementary products and services as a total solution for our customers;

    - offer industry leading digital solutions that drive customer and supplier preference, enhance
supply chain efficiency, empower employees with valuable insights and provide new sources of
profitable growth through innovation; and

    - evaluate strategic acquisitions to increase our presence and develop competitive advantage in
attractive end markets and with products and service capabilities that benefit from our scale
advantages.

We are committed to developing a healthy, high-performance culture through the selection,
recognition and development of our employees. We aspire to build an environment where the best people want
to work and add value for our customers, producers and shareholders. We will strengthen the overall
governance and efficiency of our global business operations with integrated, disciplined operating processes
and by leveraging best practices.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We derive our strength and competitive advantage from our global scale and capabilities, comprised
of transportation, storage infrastructure, exclusive authorizations of premier brands, depth and breadth of
product offering, a trained, highly skilled salesforce, industry-leading safety, regulatory, and quality,
sustainability leadership, long-standing relationships with producers, and technical differentiation, along with
our industry-leading service levels. Our private fleet enables us to provide same day and next day service to
many of our customers, which would not be feasible through many common carriers. This results in a higher
degree of security and reliability to our customers, as we are able to control our supply chain and manage our
costs better than if we were on the open marketplace.

In addition, our propriety technology platform enables us to centralize our data and exchange
information in real-time. This is highly scalable for customers, suppliers, markets, regions, and ensures our
success in the digital future. Management discipline around data and analytics drives superior demand
planning, pricing, optimization of our operations, and last mile expertise to control the inherent complexity of the
distribution business.

Our channel approach to market across C&S and I&S allows us to meet the service, portfolio and
technical needs of our global customer base in a manner that is relevant to their specific industry and
geographic needs, providing a small distributor feel of intimacy to our customers. Coupling this with our scale,
network, and intense focus on service allows us to win differentially in the market. Overall, our ability to lead
across the factors that matter most to our customers across both channels enables us to be one of the leaders
across the chemical distribution industry.

121

**_Attractive industry with significant demand tailwinds in strong end markets to fuel long-term organic growth_**

Chemicals distributors serve as key intermediaries between customers and producers to sell products
that are cost-ineffective for larger producers. We are well positioned to benefit from the growing trend of
chemical and ingredient producers and customers outsourcing key tasks to distributors. Third-party chemical
and ingredient distribution represents a small portion of the industry, with distributors underpenetrated relative
to other industries (including building materials, steel, auto parts and others). However, the industry remains
large with global third-party chemical distribution industry sales of approximately $320 billion in 2022.
Historically, chemical distribution was viewed as a channel to reach smaller customers but is increasingly
important to larger customers. The relatively low current penetration rate, combined with rising regulatory
requirements, an increased focus on ESG, customer regionalization, and supplier globalization, are expected to
be strong tailwinds for increased outsourcing penetration across both specialty and commodity chemicals. It is
a highly fragmented industry with a significant number of small, local participants; our scale provides a
meaningful competitive advantage.

As a full-line distributor with a strong, highly scaled supply-chain-network across a broad geographic
region, we are well suited to help customers and producers consolidate their distributor relationships and lower
their total costs of ownership while improving upon their service levels. Amidst a backdrop of industry-wide
underinvestment in software and digitization, we have a “First Mover” advantage derived from our leading
proprietary platform. Our advanced centralized business platform simplifies logistics and reduces complexity
and costs. As one of the leaders in chemical and ingredient distribution, we believe we can accelerate this trend
by increasing the attractiveness of our total value proposition to both customers and our suppliers.

**_Truly global platform with expansive scale and market access – #1 in North America and #2 in EMEA – powered_**
**_by centralized business technology solution_**

We operate one of the most extensive chemical and ingredient distribution networks in the world,
comprising more than 600 distribution facilities, approximately 90 million gallons of chemical storage tank
capacity and hundreds of tractors, railcars, tankers and trailers operating daily through our facilities. Our rail
and barge network, which consists of approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers, approximately 2,500
railcars, 120 rail & barge terminals, and 20 deep sea terminals, provides an irreplicable logistics network. This
highly responsive service level enables our customers to lower their inventory levels while relying on the
security of supply our scale and supplier relationship enables us to provide.

122


-----

The images below display show the locations of our distribution centers, site locations and industryleading density compared to our competitors, respectively:

Our scaled business model and numerous access points to the market enables a high level of
diversification across suppliers, customers, products and end markets:

    - our top 10 customers represent approximately 6% of our sales;

    - we offer over 15,000 products within our portfolio, with our top 15 products representing less
than 20% of our gross profit; and

    - none of our end markets represents more than approximately 18% of our sales.

We believe our purchasing power and global procurement relationships provide us with advantages
over local and regional competitors due to economies of scale. We purchase thousands of different chemicals
and ingredients from thousands of producers with flexible supply agreements without specific obligations to
buy, allowing us to manage our working capital. Additionally, many of our supply relationships for premier
brand are exclusive, providing us “sticky” business opportunities with additional pricing power.

**_Unique value proposition, positioning the business as the top choice for customers_**

Quality of service and maintaining close connections to customers is critical in distribution and an
area where we differentiate ourselves against our competitors. Our model and go-to-market approach benefit
our customers in multiple ways and we provide a range of value-added services beyond simple product
transportation, including:

    - safe and responsible handling, warehousing, and delivery with industry leading safety and
security ratings;

    - packaging sized to fit customers’ needs and tailored solutions including private label services;

    - a comprehensive portfolio of branded products and services that emphasize sustainable solutions;

    - relationships with the leading suppliers for any given product and application, including 67 new
supplier authorizations in 2022;

    - investment in digital tools that enable customers to search, select, source, and self-serve with
real-time results 24/7;

    - global scale, providing security of supply and reduced vendor lists;

    - robust sales, marketing, product management, and technical teams service the needs of the industries
and regions where we do business;

    - technical expertise and on-demand product support; and

    - simplified, safe, and reliable sourcing with a lower total cost of ownership for customers.

123

**_Long-standing and strong relationships with premier global suppliers_**

We have developed strong, long-term relationships, many spanning several decades, with the world’s
premier global chemical and ingredient producers. Today, we distribute their products to more than 100,000
customer locations around the globe, from small and medium sized businesses to global corporate accounts.
Our global network of over 1,300 suppliers provide diversification (our top 10 suppliers represent
approximately 41% of our chemical & ingredient purchases for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022) and
supply chain resiliency while maintaining security of supply. Supplier relationship lengths of over 40 years
have provided opportunities for us to integrate our service and logistics capabilities into our customers’ and
producers’ business processes while promoting collaboration on supply chain optimization, marketing and
other revenue enhancement strategies. We are able to offer a compelling and industry leading value
proposition to each of our suppliers, which underpins our ability to retain and expand our product offering.
Key points of differentiation include:

    - expand supplier reach by providing local market and industry specific knowledge and presence;

    - business intelligence allows suppliers to focus on production rather than customer service;

    - leading digital infrastructure to reduce complexity and costs while driving market penetration
and demand growth; and

    - knowledge of global trends across consumer and industrial markets to allow placing of supplier
products with right customers at right time.

_Representative suppliers_

**_Highly resilient business model with cash generative financial profile and an inherent downside hedge_**

Our distributor business model is highly resilient to recessionary periods. The earnings and cash flow
we generate benefits from the substantial diversity of our customers, end markets and geographic presence.
Since 2007, we have been able to consistently improve our Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin across
recessionary periods including the “Great Financial Crisis”, the oil price crash of 2015 and 2016, and the
COVID-19 pandemic, where our ability to work with both customers and suppliers to provide product at a
time of global supply chain disruption led to record profitability.

-----

Reported Adjusted EBITDA; 2007 – 2022 (in millions USD)

Note: Numbers for 2013 and prior years have not been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2017-07 regarding retirement
benefit accounting.

Following recessionary periods, we have been able to deliver a strong and accelerated recovery of
EBITDA. Following the “Great Financial Crisis”, our last twelve months Reported Adjusted EBITDA
recovered to pre-recession levels within four quarters, and our semi-variable cost structure limits financial
downside during period of industrial economic softness.

LTM Reported Adjusted EBITDA; 2007 – 2011 by quarter (in millions USD)

Additionally, we operate a capital-light business model, with 10-year average capital expenditures to
sales ratio of 1.3%. Our cash flows also benefit from the counter-cyclical nature of our working capital, which
typically releases cash during periods of reduced sales, and consumes cash during periods of increasing sales;
throughout the “Great Financial Crisis,” we maintained positive operating cash flow. Through our business
diversity, capital light business model and counter-cyclical working capital flows, we are able to continually
generate steady operating cash flow throughout the business cycle.

125


-----

Operating cash flow generation; 2007 – 2022 (in millions USD)

Note: Numbers for 2012 and prior years do not reflect retrospective reclassification for ASU 2016-15.

**_A proven ability to delever_**

Since 2014, we have maintained a steadfast commitment to de-leveraging and enhancing our credit
rating. As a result, our leverage, defined by the ratio of Net Debt (defined as our total indebtedness net of
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) divided by Reported Adjusted EBITDA for each fiscal year declined
from 5.9x to 2.3x, resulting in our credit ratings improving significantly.

The ratio of our Net Debt as of March 31, 2023 to Reported Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023 was 2.3x.

Net Debt and Ratio of Net Debt to Reported Adjusted EBITDA (in millions USD)

Note: Leverage ratio represents Net Debt / Reported Adjusted EBITDA. Leverage ratio as presented in this offering memorandum
differs from the presentation of "Leverage ratio" in Univar’s prior public filings.

**_Value creation through the Nexeo Acquisition_**

Our 2019 combination with Nexeo solidified our position as the largest chemical and ingredients
distribution sales force, broadest product offering and most efficient supply chain network in North America.
The Nexeo acquisition further enhanced the profitability and scale of our business, providing us with, among
other things:

      - approximately $130 million of acquired EBITDA (pro forma for the divestiture of Nexeo’s
plastics business);

      - a meaningful increase in the size of the North American logistics platform, strengthening our
presence in its key end markets and underpinning the buildout of a global high quality I&S
organization;

      - an alignment of business models, go-to-market strategies, superior product offerings, and
digital capabilities, which leveraged the strengths of the acquired Nexeo assets;

      - an expansion of our product portfolio and offering, particularly in specialty chemicals and
ingredients;

      - a truly market-leading SAP platform, providing us access to the premier digital platform in
chemical distribution, with existing integrated pricing and AI tools, with a highly
synchronized integration with our existing digital solutions offering; and

      - formation of an all-internal team to lead the integration, proving-out our capabilities as a
sector consolidator.

At the time of the Nexeo acquisition, we expected the combination to deliver $100 million of annual
run-rate cost savings by the third year following close. As of March 31, 2023, we had realized $125 million of
run-rate cost savings, following the integration of the business, as shown in the chart below:

127


-----

Overall, the Nexeo acquisition solidified Univar Solutions’ position as a leading player in North
America and transformed the business through increased scale, improved end market position, and the
implementation of a high end digital platform.

**_Safety and sustainability_**

Our safety culture is embedded into everything we do at Univar Solutions. Safety is foundational in
planning for operations, products, processes and facilities. Specific initiatives include, among others, data
driven and causality-based accident prevention work, improved process and facility controls, mandatory
general education and role specific safety training, joint management-worker health and safety committees,
safety audits, incident investigation and improvement measures.

Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in global safety metrics during the last seven
years. We track worker injuries using the OSHA standardized methodology of TCIR which is the rate of
recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked. 2022 was our safest year on record with a TCIR of 0.33,
compared with 0.40 in 2021 and ahead of our 2025 target of 0.38.

We believe this results in a competitive advantage by:

    - maintaining and improving relationships with our customers and suppliers, who view safety
performance as a key criterion for vendor selection;

    - improving employee recruitment and retention; and

    - reducing the likelihood of incidents and enabling our employees to focus on their contributions.

Additionally, we believe our focus on safety improves our service, productivity and financial performance.

We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that
meet growing customer and societal sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that
our ability to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance
environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities
presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and industry developments.

We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to these expectations through our global
sustainability goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while
addressing remediation, reducing resource use, progressing responsible sourcing and bringing more
sustainable solutions to market. In 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact,
reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular
Economy’ as a goal to 2021. In 2021, we developed and shared longer term ESG goals to 2025, 2030 and
2050. Throughout 2022 we continued to implement our strategies to drive progress on these goals.

128


-----

We incorporate ESG initiatives into our business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and
value creation. We continually strive to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce our environmental
impact and increase transparency. In 2022, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ESG practices and
our purpose to help keep our communities healthy, fed, clean and safe with net sales of 8% related to food
ingredients, 7% related to homecare and industrial cleaning, 5% related to pharmaceutical ingredients and
finished products, 4% related to industrial and municipal water treatment and 2% related to chemical waste
removal. In 2022, we dedicated resources to supporting our customers on their sustainability journeys, enhanced
our sustainable and natural products portfolio and focused on developing sustainable formulations and services.

**_Experienced and proven management team_**

Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, David Jukes, who has been with us for
over 21 years and has over 39 years of experience in the chemical and ingredient distribution industry. Since
mid-2012, our senior management team has implemented an enhanced business strategy and successfully
transformed our pricing structure, sales force effectiveness, capital efficiency and acquisition and integration
strategy. Our management team has experience operating under both public and private ownership and is
therefore well-positioned to lead us in our next phase of growth.

129


-----

Since becoming the CEO in 2018, David and the team have transformed our business into a business
with over $1 billion Reported Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and have created an organization with higher
margins, lower exposure to cyclical end markets, and have executed the transformational integration of Nexeo
into Univar Solutions’ DNA. This management team will continue to lead our organization following the
transaction.

**Segments**

Our business is organized and managed in four geographical segments: USA, EMEA, Canada and
LATAM, which includes developing businesses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. For additional
information on our geographical segments, see “Note 20: Segments” in our audited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The following charts reflect the breakdown by segment of 2022 net sales of $11.5 billion and gross profit
(exclusive of depreciation) of $2.8 billion.

      - See definition of gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

serviced primarily by regional teams and our ingredients and specialties customers are serviced primarily by our end
market and product-technically focused teams.

We believe our close proximity to customers, installed asset base, transportation and digital assets, and our
extensive product knowledge and end market expertise, all serve as competitive advantages and provide sustainable
value to our suppliers and customers.

**_EMEA_**

We maintain a strong presence in the United Kingdom and continental Europe with sales offices in 18
countries. This segment also includes two sales offices in the Middle East and Africa. Within this segment and
where possible globally, we leverage centralized or shared information technology systems, raw materials
procurement, logistics, route operations and producer relationships management to benefit from economies of scale

forestry and energy (e.g., midstream gas pipeline, oil sands processing and oil refining) further complements our
broad offerings within the country.

Our sales force is deployed through specialized account management across Canada to serve our focused
customer end markets within ingredients and specialties, and through a geographic sales district model to support the
bulk and local chemical distribution end markets. We leverage shared information systems and technology within
Canada.

131


-----

**_LATAM_**

Our LATAM operations are regionally focused with distribution sites and solution centers located
principally in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. We work to meet the needs of our customers through a team of
chemical sales, product management and supply chain professionals. As previously noted, our presence in Brazil
grew in December 2021 with the acquisition of Sweetmix.

Our offerings support commodity and specialty chemical and ingredient distribution customers primarily in
our General Industrial, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences end markets, with submarkets largely focused on
CASE, beauty and personal care, chemical manufacturing and food ingredients. We also provide formulation
services for crop protection manufacturers in Brazil.

**Products and End Markets**

We source and inventory commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such as
barge loads, railcars or full truck loads directly from producers and break down the bulk quantities to repackage,
market, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.

In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our
transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous
materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers.
We also have state-of-the-art solution centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs,
development and research centers, and taste kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical
capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles. At
the heart of our business model are our technically trained professionals with deep industry experience.

**_Chemicals and Services_**

Chemicals and Services represent the largest portion of our business by sales, volume and gross profit
(exclusive of depreciation). Our product portfolio principally includes a wide range of organic and inorganic
chemistries, surfactants, inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout most
end markets. Investments in salesforce effectiveness systems are focused on a customer centric selling model, which
coupled with our facility, transportation and digital asset bases, and our extensive supplier partnerships, all support
growth within the chemicals distribution landscape.

**_Ingredients and Specialties_**

Ingredients and Specialties represent a more value added, higher-growth portion of the market tailored to
specific end market requirements. For each Ingredients and Specialties market, we have dedicated sales, marketing,
product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of individual submarkets like food
ingredients or pharmaceuticals, serving approximately 500 strategic specialty chemical suppliers and approximately
42,000 customer locations. These specialty products are typically sold in lower volumes, but at a higher gross profit
(exclusive of depreciation) than commodity products. We believe growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce
effectiveness, delivering solutions through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our

**Suppliers**

We source materials from approximately 1,800 producers around the globe and we typically maintain
relationships with multiple producers in order to protect against disruption in supply and distribution logistics, as
well as to ensure competitive pricing of our supply. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our ten largest
producers accounted for approximately 41% of our total chemical purchases.

**Distribution Channels**

We have multiple channels to market, including both warehouse delivery and direct-to-consumer delivery.
The principal determinants of the way a customer is serviced include the size, scale and level of customization of a
particular order, the nature of the product and the customer, and the location of the product inventories. Our logistics

134


-----

and supply chain expertise allows us to service a wide range of customers by offering multiple package sizes and
assistance with special handling requirements, safety and quality specifications.

**_Warehouse distribution_**

Our warehouse distribution infrastructure is the core of our operations and connects large producers with
smaller volume customers whose consumption patterns tend to make them uneconomical to be served directly by
producers. As a result, the core customer serviced via our warehouses is a small or medium-volume consumer of
chemicals and ingredients. We purchase chemicals and ingredients in truck load or larger quantities from producers
based on contracted demands of our customers and our estimates of anticipated customer purchases. Once received,
products are stored in one or more of our distribution facilities for sale and distribution in smaller, less-thantruckload quantities to our customers. Our warehouses have various facilities for services such as repackaging,
blending and mixing to create specialized solutions needed by our customers in ready-to-use formulations.

**_Direct distribution_**

In direct distribution, we sell and service large quantity purchases that are shipped directly from producers
through our logistics infrastructure, which provides our customers with sourcing and logistics support services for
inventory management and delivery.

**Competition**

The chemical and ingredient distribution and service industry is highly competitive. Most of the products
that we distribute are made to standard specifications and are either produced by or available from multiple sources.
Furthermore, chemical and ingredient distribution itself is a fragmented market in which only a small number of
competitors have substantial international operations. Our principal international competitors are Brenntag SE,
IMCD NV, Barentz International NV and Azelis Group NV, each of which have differentiating strengths across
regions and not all of whom have the ability to serve all of the end markets in which we operate. Many other
chemical and ingredient distributors focus on a more limited geographic region or smaller subset of products,
building strong relationships with local producers and customers that may give them a competitive advantage in
their local market.

Chemical and ingredient producers may also sell their products through a direct sales force, digital
marketplace or multiple chemical distributors, limiting their use of third party distributors, particularly with respect
to higher margin products, or partnering with other chemical and ingredient producers for distribution, each of
which could impact our competitive position.

We compete on the basis of service, on-time delivery, packaging type, product breadth and availability,
product and market knowledge and insights, safety and environmental compliance, global reach, product price, as
well as our ability to provide certain additional value-added services through our comprehensive suite of solutionbased offerings.

**Human Capital Resources**

We recognize that our people represent our most important asset. As part of our effort to drive continued
growth and increased profitability, we are intently focused on building a place that attracts and retains top talent and
develops the skills necessary to drive differentiation for our business. The below data provides a snapshot of our
employee and management demographics as of December 31, 2022:

**Employees*** **People Managers*** 1,753
USA 5,498 Male 66 %

(*) Information based on self-identification data.

We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies that guide our human capital management
approach as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies are advanced through a number of
programs and initiatives as outlined below:

**_Employee Total Rewards and Wellbeing_**

Our total rewards programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with their
performance and to provide appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior
results. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels,
experience, knowledge and geographic location. Full-time US employees are eligible for health, dental and vision
insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401(k) plan and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. Employees
outside of the US are eligible for a variety of supplemental benefits based on local market practices and all
employees worldwide are eligible for an employee assistance program and other wellbeing programs. We
periodically benchmark our total rewards offerings externally to ensure we remain competitive.

**_Training and Development_**

All employees have access to on-demand learning resources for their own professional development on a
range of diverse topics such as digital transformation skills, professional effectiveness, diversity, equity and
inclusion, business skills, productivity, collaboration tools and leadership development. Our internal program
offerings range from multi-day, instructor-led trainings to short, on-demand eLearning programs. As appropriate,
additional training hours are delivered and monitored locally, often focusing on material handling and safety for
specific roles. The Company’s guiding principles and cultural values are incorporated into our Code Handbook, to
which all employees certify annually.

**_Employee Engagement_**

We regularly conduct confidential employee engagement surveys and focus groups. The feedback gathered
from these surveys and focus groups helps guide our decision-making and strategic initiatives. In 2022, at least 85%
of our global employee population participated in one or more of these feedback channels, sharing their sentiments
on key aspects of working at the Company. The engagement survey results are shared in aggregate with managers,
who are then tasked with taking action based on employee feedback. In doing so, our goal is to drive year-over-year
improvement in employee engagement, which we believe will deliver qualitative and quantitative benefits for our
Company.

**_Health and Safety_**

We are serious about safety, which is a key area of focus across our global operations. Specific initiatives
include, among others, data driven and causality-based accident prevention work, improved process and facility
controls, mandatory general education and role specific safety training, joint management-worker health and safety
committees, safety audits, incident investigation and improvement measures. 2022 was our safest year on record
with a Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), the rate of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked, of 0.33, compared
with 0.40 in 2021 and ahead of our 2025 target of 0.38.

136


-----

**_Diversity, Equity & Inclusion_**

We are committed to fostering a safe, collaborative, supportive and respectful environment that values
diverse perspectives, mitigates unconscious bias and enables a culture where employees are able to bring their
authentic self to work. In the past year we maintained our score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate
Equality Index, increased the favorability rating of our inclusive culture amongst our salaried employee population,
increased the number of female people managers globally and increased the number of ethnically diverse people
managers in the USA. We use our global inclusion councils to help hold ourselves accountable for progress and
drive decision-making for the needs of our diverse employee groups. Additionally, we seek to drive greater
employee engagement, create education opportunities, and instill a greater sense of community through the efforts of
our eight Employee Resource Networks.

As a July 2020 signatory of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion[TM] (CEO Action) coalition, we have
pledged to take action designed to foster a safe, collaborative, supporting and respectful environment. We are
committed to fostering equality and equity across our Company and have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination
and harassment. In accordance with this policy, we strive to recruit and hire employees based on qualifications and
fit for a job and without regard to race, religion, nationality, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other
status protected by law. We also have systems under which employees can report incidents confidentially or
anonymously without fear of reprisal.

**Regulatory Matters**

We operate in a number of jurisdictions and are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local
laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. We are subject to extensive environmental, health
and safety laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions because we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport and
arrange for the disposal of chemicals, hazardous materials and hazardous waste. These include, without limitation,
laws regulating discharges of hazardous substances into the soil, air and water, blending, managing, handling,
storing, selling, transporting and disposing of hazardous substances, investigation and remediation of contaminated
properties and protecting the safety of our employees and others. Some of these laws and regulations include the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), the Toxic
Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), among others. Some of our operations are
required to hold environmental permits and licenses to be compliant and certain of our services businesses are also
impacted by these laws.

In addition to environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to various other laws and regulations
around the world. For example, our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we
operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the US, as well as similar
foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices,
boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition, and such laws and
regulations may impact potential business relationships or transactions with third parties in the future. We are also
required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and
personal data in Europe, the US and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security,
including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other
consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Further, an increasing number of laws and regulations focused on
hazardous products and substances could also impact our ability to distribute and sell certain products or require
significant capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. With respect to the laws and regulations noted
above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, our compliance programs may under certain circumstances
involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology and
capital.

**Sustainability**

We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that meet
growing customer and societal sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that our ability
to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance environmentally and

137


-----

socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities presented through increased
legal requirements, climate parameters and industry developments.

We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to these expectations through our global sustainability
goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while addressing remediation,
reducing resource use, progressing responsible sourcing and bringing more sustainable solutions to market. In 2018,
we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible
business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular Economy’ as a goal to 2021. In 2021, we developed and
shared longer term ESG goals to 2025, 2030 and 2050. Throughout 2022 we continued to implement our strategies
to drive progress on these goals.

We incorporate ESG initiatives into our business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and value
creation. We continually strive to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce our environmental impact and
increase transparency. In 2022, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ESG practices and our purpose to help
keep our communities healthy, fed, clean and safe with net sales of 8% related to food ingredients, 7% related to
homecare and industrial cleaning, 5% related to pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products, 4% related to
industrial and municipal water treatment and 2% related to chemical waste removal. In 2022, we dedicated resources
to supporting our customers on their sustainability journeys, enhanced our sustainable and natural products portfolio
and focused on developing sustainable formulations and services.

**Intellectual Property**

We consider intellectual property, particularly trade secrets and know-how, as important to our success. We
hold some patents and own numerous trademarks in multiple jurisdictions. Further, we have various patent and
trademark applications pending in jurisdictions worldwide. Although we consider our patents, trademarks,
copyrights and trade secrets to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially
dependent upon an individual patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret.

**Significant Customers**

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in any of the years presented.

**Other**

No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or
subcontracts at the election of any government.

**INDUSTRY**

**The Chemical and Ingredient Distribution Industry**

Distributors play an essential role within the global chemical value chain by providing customers of all
sizes access to mission-critical chemicals and ingredients that underpin their commercial products. While suppliers
are able to directly serve large end-users, there are many thousands of smaller customers who require chemical and
ingredient inputs that are not economic for large producers to serve. Distributors fill this gap by purchasing
chemicals and ingredients from producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell
those chemicals to customers through a more regional supply chain and at volumes that may be meaningfully below
traditional order sizes for producers.

Chemical and ingredient producers rely on distributors to market and sell their products – to expand their
industry access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Distributors may
also offer additional services like formulation, technical and engineering consulting, digital insights, and guidance
around regulations. At the same time, customers that purchase through distribution benefit from a lower total cost of
ownership and simplify their chemical and ingredient sourcing process with benefits including just-in- time delivery,
excellent product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending, and technical expertise.

There are many factors that can influence customer preference when evaluating which distributor(s) to
partner with, including:

    - **Scale and logistics network – Locality and network breadth to ensure chemicals can be received**
quickly and at volume. Proximity to customers also drives engagement and enables logistical
flexibility for the distributor;

    - **Availability of a broad range of products – Access to a sizeable portfolio and inventory of chemicals**
that can meet all of the customer’s needs and are available when such needs arise. A broad portfolio
allows customers to source from a single distributor, simplifying operations and lowering costs;

    - **Technical expertise and service – Customer centricity and strong chemical and ingredient know how**
– including the ability to jointly innovate with customers and match their needs and capabilities to the
required chemical and ingredient inputs, particularly for smaller customers who may not have internal
technical resources; and

    - **Quality of supplier and brands – Partnership with leading producers to ensure a consistent and**
reliable supply of chemical product, primarily sourced within the geographies of the customer to
ensure security of supply.

139


-----

At the same time, suppliers are seeking distributors who demonstrate the following:

    - **Scale and extensive logistics network – Strong presence in regions where suppliers’ products are in**
demand, as well as strong logistics capabilities to handle transportation, storage and delivery of
products across a wide range of products and volumes;

    - **Technical expertise and market knowledge – A deep understanding of both products being**
distributed, as well as markets being served (including key players, trends and regulatory
requirements) to provide insights and analysis to suppliers;

    - **Financial stability – A solid financial track record and strong creditworthiness to ensure shipments are**
paid on time and consistent investments are made in the business over the long-term;

    - **Brand awareness – Reputable track record in distribution to support suppliers’ own brand recognition**
and perception of quality in the market; and

    - **Digital as a trend – Advanced digital capabilities to provide insights into customer behavior, which**
can then be used to strengthen both the producer and the distributor’s positions within a given market.

**Distribution Models**

There are three primary chemical distribution business models – commodity, specialty, and “full-line” –
which each have their own distinct characteristics.

**_Commodity chemical distributors_**

Commodity chemical distributors focus on standardized chemicals that have minimal variation per
application. Commodity chemicals are often used as the starting material to produce a wide variety of other
chemicals and tend to have transparent pricing, with producers typically selling large volumes to their customers.
Examples of commodity chemicals include ethylene, propylene, phenol, methanol, and formaldehyde. The Univar
Solutions product portfolio principally includes a wide range of organic and inorganic chemistries, surfactants,
inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout most end markets.

For these commodity chemical distributors, product availability, logistical network and customer service
are essential differentiators for customers, given the limited potential for product differentiation. For suppliers, scale,
reliability and reputation are key success factors when selecting a distributor. Suppliers favor commodity chemical

140


-----

distributors with broad logistical networks and a suitable inventory across a comprehensive product portfolio,
particularly if they are able to enable expansion beyond that supplier’s existing offering (either via incremental endmarkets or new geographic markets). The ability to purchase higher volumes is also attractive for suppliers, who
thus favor larger-scale commodity chemical distributors in order to reach smaller, more regionalized customers.
Additionally, greater scale gives us better insight into market trends, generating a better understanding of real-time
demands of customers, greater market insights, and a higher level of technical expertise. Switching costs are
however low for suppliers, and relationships are generally not exclusive. Given the commodity focused nature, these
distributors typically operate lower-margin, higher-volume business models, relative to other distributors. However,
given the relatively low cost of commodity chemicals, these products make up a limited portion of a customer’s total
costs, and as a result, customers tend to be inclined to maintain relationships with their distributors if products are
delivered safely and on-time.

Despite selling relatively standardized products, commodity chemical distributors vary significantly to
chemical traders. The trader business model is predicated largely on the purchase and sale of bulk chemicals, given
the relatively transparent pricing and spot markets. While commodity chemical distributors also generate value
through their ability to maintain a spread between purchase and selling price, they differ greatly given their intense
customer focus and value-additive service offering embedded within their business model. Commodity chemical
distributors maintain a highly complex logistical network to ensure that customers are able to receive their products
in a timely manner, given their mission critical status to most operations. At the same time, these chemicals are often
hazardous and difficult-to-handle, adding an additional layer of complexity that distributors manage for both
suppliers and customers.

**_Specialty chemical distributors_**

Specialty chemical distributors focus on complex and tailored formulations that target specific applications
within a given end market. Specialty chemical pricing is based on the value added by the product and is generally
sold by a skilled and technical salesforce that is able to create or recommend customized formulations for their end
customers. Specialty chemical distributors operate on a lower-volume, higher-margin model. While less
capital-intensive than commodity chemicals, scale remains vital in specialty chemical distributors, as it allows
companies to leverage a larger product portfolio to gain more touch points across suppliers and customers.
Sometimes, less technical logistical and warehousing operations are outsourced to third parties, while technical
marketing and business development are crucial activities performed in-house. Examples of categories of specialty
chemicals include construction chemicals, adhesives, food additives, and surfactants.

In their production, specialty chemicals undergo a complicated value chain. They generally begin as
commodity chemicals, which are essentially used as raw materials that undergo reactions to form chemical
intermediates. From there, specific chemical or biological reactions are performed to further refine these
intermediates into specialty chemicals and ingredients. Oftentimes, several reactions and processes must be
performed to create a specific specialty product. Due to the complexity of this value chain, specialty chemicals are
generally sold as downstream products and tailored for niche end markets.

For specialty distributors, domain expertise in a given end market is essential, alongside the ability to create
tailor-made solutions for customers. To this end, supplier relationships are essential and often exist on an exclusive
basis. Thus, switching costs are generally high, and specialty chemicals are not easily replaceable with one another
in comparison to commodity chemicals, particularly to smaller customers for whom custom formulations have been
prepared.

**_Full-line distributors_**

Full-line distributors encompass both commodity and specialty products to provide end-to-end chemical
solutions to customers. This model is pursued by large global players with scale, such as Univar Solutions and
Brenntag, to enable a sophisticated business model that can effectively serve both commodity and specialty
customers despite their contrasting needs.

Our commodity channel is reported as C&S. The C&S channel is characterized by two core competencies:
Local Chemical Distribution (“LCD”) and Bulk Chemical Distribution (“BCD”). In LCD, we are the largest while

141


-----

having a strong local presence as a distributor throughout the United States and Canada with the most extensive
network and facility capabilities. We are able to receive product in barge, rail and truck and deliver to our customers
by rail, truck and parcel, outlining the extent of our reach. In BCD, we are a market leader in the United States and
Canada for six major inorganic chemistries. We are able to demonstrate producer-like economies of scale with
distributor level logistics. The C&S channel also offers differentiating services like MiniBulk, a high retention, safe,
full-service model for difficult-to-handle chemicals, and ChemCare, a waste chemical collection and disposal
service. Due to the capital-intensive nature of commodity distribution, our expansive scale offers numerous
advantages including its denser logistics network, broad stock availability, competitive pricing, and deeper supplier
and customer relationships.

Our specialty channel is reported as I&S. I&S is powered by dedicated sales, marketing, product
management and technical services dedicated to each end market we serve. Additionally, our global network of
solution centers focused on product formulation, technical differentiation, and problem solving. Despite the
specialty chemical and ingredient distribution channel being less capital-intensive by nature, our large scale still
proves to be advantageous, as its scale provides its customers with access to a stronger product portfolio, supply
assurance, technical expertise, and a broader range of value-added services that are essential and often don’t exist inhouse.

For full-line distributors including Univar Solutions, there are synergies between operating both business
models. The critical size in storage and logistics required for the commodity channel supports the specialty channel
by enabling a broader product suite to be supported by a distribution infrastructure enabling effective logistics to
clients. Overall, the full-line distributor model can take advantage of industry growth trends across a range of end
markets and maintain diversification and stability, thus lowering overall business volatility.

**Competitive Landscape**

The chemical distribution market is highly fragmented due to the diverse range of products, services,
customers, and its regionalized nature (smaller distributors generally specialize in particular regions as well as
products). While the industry consists of tens of thousands of players, scaled distributors have some competitive
advantages due to their existing capital investment, significant logistics networks and experience operating in a
highly regulated environment.

**North American Chemical Distribution Competitive Landscape[(a)]**

142


-----

The fragmented market provides an opportunity for larger players to consolidate in specific channels,
products and regions.

Customers generally seek a “one-stop shop” distributor with strong industry knowledge, multiple product
lines, and various geographic regions and end markets served. Likewise, suppliers prefer to work with fewer
distributors in order to reduce costs and complexities that arise from dealing with multiple distributors.

The key drivers for market consolidation include:

    - **Building scale in existing geographies and channels and broadening geographic reach –**
Distributors seek to capture a higher number of customers in both their existing geographies, as well as
in new markets. In turn, this benefits suppliers who also seek a broader distribution network for their
products, particularly in geographies that it is not economical or practical for them to serve directly;

    - **Bolt-on acquisitions – Distributors acquire local or regional distributors that service suppliers with**
whom they already have a strong relationship within other geographies, both to reduce complexity and
to create a “one-stop shop” for the supplier. These acquisitions are generally performed to strengthen
supplier-distributor relationships;

    - **Greater efficiency and ease of business for customers – Distributors consolidate with the goal of**
channel expansion by acquiring smaller companies to improve supplier relationships and product mix.
This strengthens the value proposition for customers that seek large distributors with a broad product
portfolio;

    - **Vertical integration – Both acquisitions of upstream or downstream companies in the chemical value**
chain allow distributors to expand capabilities, reduce risk of supply chain disruptions and capture a
larger portion of the total value transferred and added; and

    - **Increased capabilities and value-added services – New services strengthen the distributor's value**
proposition for both customers and suppliers that seek market expertise and value-added services. (e.g.,
our acquisition of Nexeo in 2019, which added important technology including new ERP and pricing
tools, as well as strengthened operating capabilities, especially in our I&S channel).

**Market Size and Growth**

As of 2022, the estimated market for chemical consumption is approximately $4,800 billion, of which
approximately $1,500 billion of considered non-distributable (e.g., products that travel to customers through
pipelines), resulting in a market for distributable chemical consumption of approximately $3,300 billion. Within this
market, it is estimated that only 11% is currently served through distributors globally.

The outsourced chemical distribution market in 2022 was approximately $320 billion in size, and is
expected to return to stable long-term real growth of 3-5% following recent supply chain disruptions. The market
consistently shows steady growth across both commodity and specialty sectors, as well as across geographies.

**Global Chemicals Distribution Industry (ex. Asia) and End Markets [(a)]**

(a) Source: IHS, Remakers. Oxford Economics, internal data and management views

Since 2015, the distribution market has grown steadily at approximately 3-5% year over year. From 20192022, the market experienced little disruption from COVID-19 and growth of approximately 4-5%, underpinned by
increased pricing driven by supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 period. In 2023, the market is expected to
experience a year of price normalization, in which slower growth of approximately 2% is expected. From 20232027, the overall market is expected to grow at approximately 4-5% however there is variation across end markets
including Food and Pharma which are expected to grow at rates greater than 5%. Growth is expected to be driven by
both the following factors:

**_Increased Chemical and Ingredient Consumption_**

Though the global chemical and ingredient distribution industry is large and highly fragmented, it still
represents a relatively small portion of total available chemical industry sales. The chemical industry as a whole is
projected to grow close to gross national product (“GNP”) of countries operated in around the world, while the
distributed chemicals portion of the industry is projected to grow even faster, as its fullest potential has not yet been
realized. Global chemical consumption is predicted to grow at approximately 2-4% annually into the long-term.

**_Increased Rates by Outsourcing_**

Currently, only approximately 11% of the Chemical Distribution market is outsourced to chemical
distributors. Due to regulation, increased focus on sustainability, digitization, regionalization, and globalization of
supply, outsourcing is expected to increase by 10bps per year, driving approximately 1% of incremental Chemical
Distribution market growth annually.

Many suppliers turn to third-party distributors to manage supply-chain operations. This ensures that
suppliers can focus on core capabilities such as manufacturing and R&D, while allowing distributors to focus on
sales and complexity issues beyond suppliers’ expertise. Outsourcing penetration in specialty chemicals is lower
than that of commodities due to the more specialized production techniques, greater demands in product handling
and transportation, increased technical expertise needed to sell specialty products and the more niche end market
applications.

144


-----

There are a number of trends supporting a longer-term increase in outsourcing to chemical distributors in
the medium to long- term:

    - Suppliers seeking to reduce complexity by transferring smaller customers to distributors and
consolidating distribution channels (benefiting large and scaled distributors);

    - As customer differentiation increases, higher complexity within smaller customer channels arises,
which is easier for distributors to manage;

    - Customers seeking increased value-added services and formulation support with digital technology
capabilities, which distributors are continuing to invest in;

    - Geographic reach in growth markets, such as Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America, where
distributors have better access; and

    - Increasing regulatory requirements in developed markets (including increased focus on ESG) and
demand for compliance in emerging markets that a distributor is better suited to handle and more
experienced in.

Based on our survey of suppliers, over 75% of suppliers expect both specialty and commodity outsourcing
in North America, Europe and APAC to grow over the next three years. Supplier expectations for outsourcing
penetration vary by channel and region. In Europe, 86% of suppliers expect growth in specialty, while 94% expect
growth in commodity. In North America, 83% of suppliers expect growth in specialty, while only 76% expect
growth in commodity.

Overall, suppliers expect North American chemical distribution outsourcing penetration to reach
approximately 22-23% by 2027 while in Europe, it is expected to reach approximately 12% by 2027. Every 10bps
increase in yearly outsourcing rate from 2022 to 2028 is expected to drive an additional approximately 0.8% of
market CAGR for chemical distribution.

**_Economically Resilient Market_**

Overall, the distributor model is more resilient to recessionary periods than chemical production and the
model provides a natural cash flow hedge in a downturn since working capital unwinds when revenue contracts.

Generally, there are a number of factors that support resiliency in chemical distribution in recessionary
periods:

    - **Customer diversification – Given the highly fragmented customer-base of the business, oftentimes**

145


-----

distributors are not reliant on a few main customers for sales;

- **Geographic diversification – Global distributors will experience lessened impacts of regional**
geopolitical events and can manage supply chains accordingly in the event of a slowdown in a
particular region;

- **Resilient end market exposure – Exposure to life sciences end markets like personal care, healthcare,**
food nutrients, and pharmaceuticals, are less cyclical. Demand in these end markets remain strong,
even in a poor economy; and

- **Flexible asset-light business model – Despite warehouses and trucks being an integral part of**
chemical distribution, many distributors choose to outsource this task. Chemical distributors also
provide asset-light offerings including strong relationships between suppliers and customers, industry
expertise and technical capabilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following summaries of the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility do not purport to be complete
and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the corresponding
agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not otherwise defined in this offering
memorandum. The terms of the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility are subject to continuing negotiations
between us and our prospective lenders and could change in the definitive documentation for the Term Loan Facility
or the ABL Facility, as applicable.

**Term Loan Facility**

**_General_**

We plan to enter into a new $2,300.0 million (equivalent) senior secured term loan credit facility (the
“Term Loan Facility”), comprised of a $1,750 million U.S. dollar tranche (the “USD Term Loans”) and a $550.0
million (equivalent) euro tranche (the “Euro Term Loans”), on the closing date of the Merger. The Term Loan
Facility is expected to have a maturity of seven years.

In addition, we may request one or more incremental term loan facilities, one or more incremental
revolving credit facilities and/or an increase in commitments under the Term Loan Facility (collectively,
“incremental facilities”) in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of (x) the greater of (i) $965.0 million and (ii) 1.00
times Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA calculated on a pro forma basis as of the date of incurrence of such incremental
facilities or the establishment of commitments in respect thereof plus (y) such additional amounts so long as, (i) in
the case of loans under incremental facilities secured by liens on the collateral that rank pari passu with the liens on
collateral securing the Term Loan Facility, our net first lien secured leverage ratio calculated on a pro forma basis
would be no greater than a ratio to be agreed upon, (ii) in the case of loans under incremental facilities secured by
liens on collateral that rank junior to the liens on the collateral securing the Term Loan Facility, our net secured
leverage ratio calculated on a pro forma basis would be no greater than a ratio to be agreed upon and (iii) in the case
of loans under such incremental facilities that are unsecured, either (1) the ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to
total cash interest expense calculated on a pro forma basis is not less than 2.00 to 1.00 or (2) our net total leverage
ratio would be no greater than a ratio to be agreed upon, in each case, subject to certain conditions and receipt of
commitments by existing or additional lenders plus (z) available capacity under a general debt basket to be agreed
upon.

Proceeds of the term loans drawn on the closing date of the Merger, together with the other sources of
funds described under “Use of Proceeds,” will be used to partially fund the Transactions and to pay related fees and
expenses.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to, (x) in the case of Euro Term
Loans, EURIBOR determined by reference to the interbank offered rate administered by the European Money
Markets Institute, adjusted for certain additional costs, which rate shall be no less than a floor to be agreed
(“Adjusted EURIBOR”) or (y) in the case of the USD Term Loans, at our option, either (a) term SOFR determined
by reference to the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which rate
shall be no less than zero or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the sum of the federal funds
rate plus 0.50% per annum, (ii) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” and (iii) the
sum of one-month term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, plus, for each of term SOFR, Adjusted EURIBOR and the
base rate, an applicable margin to be agreed upon.

**_Amortization and Prepayments_**

The USD Term Loans will require scheduled quarterly amortization payments of USD Term Loans in an
annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the USD Term Loans borrowed on the closing date

151


-----

of the Term Loan Facility, with the balance to be paid at maturity. The Euro Term Loans will not amortize and the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Term Loans will be paid at maturity.

In addition, the Term Loan Facility will require us to prepay outstanding term loan borrowings, subject to
certain exceptions, with:

    - beginning with the first full fiscal year ending after the closing date of the Term Loan Facility, 50%
(which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if the net first lien secured leverage ratio is less than
or equal to ratios to be agreed upon) of our annual excess cash flow, as defined under the Term Loan
Facility;

    - 100% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% and 0% if the net first lien secured leverage ratio is
less than or equal to ratios to be agreed upon) of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset
sales, other dispositions of property or certain casualty events, in each case subject to certain
exceptions and reinvestment rights; and

    - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt
permitted under the Term Loan Facility.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time, without prepayment
premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the term loans as described below,
subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to loans bearing interest at term SOFR or Adjusted EURIBOR.

Any refinancing through the issuance of certain debt or any repricing amendment, in either case, that
constitutes a “repricing event” applicable to the term loans resulting in a lower yield occurring at any time during the
first six months after the closing date of the Term Loan Facility will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment
premium or fee, as applicable.

**_Collateral and Guarantors_**

All obligations under the Term Loan Facility will be unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings on a limitedrecourse basis and by each of our existing and future direct and indirect, wholly owned material domestic
subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility will be secured by a pledge
of our capital stock directly held by Holdings and by the same priority liens on the assets of the Issuer and the
subsidiary guarantors that secure the notes, as further described in the section entitled “Description of Notes—
Security.”

**_Restrictive Covenants and Other Matters_**

The Term Loan Facility will contain certain customary affirmative covenants. The negative covenants in
the Term Loan Facility will include, among other things, limitations (none of which are absolute) on our ability to:

    - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions);

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted
payments;

    - consolidate, amalgamate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - sell certain assets;

152


-----

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

    - enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions;

    - change our lines of business;

    - restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens;

    - change our fiscal year; and

    - prepay subordinated debt or modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.

The Term Loan Facility will contain a customary passive holding company covenant with respect to
Holdings.

The Term Loan Facility will contain certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of
control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various
actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions permitted to be
taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the Term Loan Facility.

**ABL Facility**

**_General_**

We plan to enter into a new senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) on the
closing date of the Merger, which we expect will provide aggregate borrowing availability equal to the lesser of
$1,400.0 million (equivalent) and the borrowing base described below. The ABL Facility is expected to have a
maturity of five years. On the Merger Closing Date, the ABL Facility is expected to have two subfacilities,
consisting of:

    - a $1,250.0 million subfacility with respect to borrowings by borrowers organized in the United States or
Canada (the “North American ABL Subfacility”); and

    - a $150.0 million (equivalent) subfacility with respect to borrowings by borrowers organized in certain
European jurisdictions set forth in the definitive documentation for the ABL Facility (the “European
ABL Subfacility”).

Borrowing availability under the North American ABL Subfacility will be determined based on the North
American borrowing base described below. Borrowing availability under the European ABL Subfacility will be
determined based on the European borrowing base described below.

In addition, we may request one or more “first-in-last-out” incremental revolving credit facilities and/or
increases in commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) the greater
of 1.00 times Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA calculated on a pro forma basis and $965.0 million and (y) the amount
by which the then-current borrowing base exceeds total commitments under the ABL Facility, in each case, subject
to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders. We may also request additional
incremental revolving credit facilities with respect to borrowers organized in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, subject
to certain terms and conditions.

All borrowings under the ABL Facility following the closing date of the Merger will be subject to the
satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default and the accuracy of
representations and warranties in all material respects.

Proceeds of the loans under the ABL Facility drawn on the closing date of the Merger, together with the
other sources of funds described under “Use of Proceeds,” will be used to partially fund the Transactions (subject to

153


-----

a cap on the amount that may be borrowed on the closing date of the Merger). Proceeds of the loans under the ABL
Facility drawn after the closing date of the Merger, swingline loans and letters of credit will be used for working
capital and general corporate purposes.

We expect that $500.0 million under the ABL Facility will be drawn on the closing date of the Merger (in
addition to approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date).

**_Borrowing Base_**

The North American borrowing base under the North American ABL Subfacility will be, at any time of
determination, an amount (net of reserves) equal to, with respect to the Issuer and the subsidiary borrowers and
subsidiary guarantors organized in the United States or Canada, the sum of:

    - 85% of the book value of eligible receivables (other than receivables from investment grade account
debtors), plus

    - 90% of the net appraised liquidation value of eligible inventory, plus

    - 90% of the book value of eligible receivables from investment grade account debtors, plus

    - 100% of qualified cash of North American loan parties (provided, that, the aggregate amount of
qualified cash included in the North American borrowing base will not exceed 15% of the North
American borrowing base).

The European borrowing base under the European ABL Subfacility will be, at any time of determination,
an amount (net of reserves) equal to, with respect to the subsidiary borrowers and subsidiary guarantors organized in
certain European jurisdictions set forth in the definitive documentation for the ABL Facility, the sum of:

    - 85% of the book value of eligible receivables (other than receivables from investment grade account
debtors), plus

    - 85% of the net appraised liquidation value of eligible inventory, plus

    - 90% of eligible investment grade receivables,

_provided that the amount of eligible receivables and eligible inventory attributable to borrowers organized in certain_
non-U.S. jurisdictions shall not exceed a sublimit to be agreed.

The ABL Facility is expected to include provisions allowing reallocation of commitments among the North
American ABL Subfacility, the European ABL Subfacility and certain subfacilities that may be established with
respect to borrowers organized in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, subject to certain terms and conditions.

The ABL Facility is expected to include borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and bank
guarantees and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swing line loans. Based on estimated borrowing
base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to
be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of
the closing date, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility
as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. The estimated borrowing base
availability of $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023 will be updated based on a field exam and appraisal and
therefore could differ as of the closing date of the Transactions.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Borrowings under the ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to (w) with respect to borrowings of
US dollars, at our option, either (a) term SOFR determined by reference to the secured overnight financing rate
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a credit spread adjustment or (b) a base rate determined
by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the sum of
one-month adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, (x) with respect to borrowings of Euros, either (a)

154


-----

EURIBOR determined by reference to the interbank offered rate administered by the European Money Markets
Institute, adjusted for certain additional costs or (b) in the case of swingline loans funded in Euros, ESTR
determined by reference to the Euro Short Term Rate on such business day published by the European Central Bank
or (y) with respect to borrowings of pounds sterling, the Daily Simple SONIA determined by reference to the
Sterling Overnight Index Average for such business day published by the Bank of England or (z) with respect to
borrowings of Canadian dollars, at our option, either (a) the BA Rate determined by reference to the rate for
Canadian dollar denominated bankers’ acceptances for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or (b) a prime
rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate in effect for Canadian dollar denominated
commercial loans and (ii) the sum of one-month BA Rate plus 1.00% per annum. Each borrowing will also be
subject to the applicable interest rate margin. The applicable margin for SOFR, SONIA, EURIBOR and BA Rate
borrowings under the ABL Facility are expected to be 1.50% to 2.00% and the applicable margins for ESTR, base
rate and prime rate borrowings under the ABL Facility 0.50% to 1.00%, in each case, based on excess availability.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we will be required to pay a
commitment fee to the lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate equal to 0.25% or
0.375% per annum depending on the average utilization of the commitments. We will also be required to pay
customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the
applicable margin for SOFR borrowings (or, in the case of commercial letters of credit, 50% of the applicable
margin for SOFR borrowings) on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit,
plus such letter of credit issuer’s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee
computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the ABL Facility at any time, without premium or
penalty, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR loans and EURIBOR loans.

**_Collateral and Guarantors_**

All obligations under the ABL Facility (and at our option certain hedging, cash management and bank
product obligations secured under the ABL Facility) will be unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings on a limitedrecourse basis and by each of our existing and future direct and indirect, wholly owned domestic material
subsidiaries and by certain foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations will be secured by a
pledge of our capital stock directly held by Holdings, substantially all of our assets and those of each domestic
subsidiary guarantor and by substantially all of the inventory and accounts receivable and related assets of our
foreign subsidiary guarantors and foreign subsidiary borrowers, subject to certain exceptions. Such security interest
consists of (1) a first-priority lien with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral and (2) a second-priority lien with
respect to the Notes Priority Collateral.

**_Covenants_**

The ABL Facility will contain certain customary affirmative covenants. The negative covenants in the ABL
Facility will include, among other things, limitations (none of which are absolute) on our ability to:

    - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions);

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted
payments;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - sell certain assets;

155


-----

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

    - enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions;

    - change our lines of business;

    - restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens;

    - change our fiscal year; and

    - prepay subordinated debt or modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.

In addition, on or after the last day of the first full fiscal quarter ending after the closing date of the ABL
Facility, the ABL Facility will require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 at any
time if as of such time availability is less than the greater of (x) $105 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (i) the
borrowing base at such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of ABL Facility commitments at such time.

The ABL Facility will contain certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of
control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions,
including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured
creditor in respect of the collateral securing the ABL Facility.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Windsor Holdings III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Issuer”), will issue      % Senior
Secured Notes due 2030 (the “notes”) under an indenture (the “indenture”), to be entered into by and among the
Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) party thereto from time to time and Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as Trustee. In this description, (i) references to the “Issuer” mean the Issuer, but not any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) “we,” “us” and “our” mean the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Copies of the indenture (once
available) may be obtained from the Issuer upon request.

The following summary of certain provisions of the indenture, the notes, the Security Documents, the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (as defined below) does
not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of those
agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes”
section and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuer will issue notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,800 million. Following the
Issue Date, the Issuer may issue additional notes from time to time. Any offering of additional notes is subject to the
covenants described below under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” The notes and any
additional notes subsequently issued under the indenture may, at our election, be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase; provided that if the additional notes are not fungible with the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number, if applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all
purposes of the indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to the notes include any additional notes
actually issued.

This offering may be consummated prior to the Merger Closing Date. If this offering is consummated prior
to the Merger Closing Date, the gross proceeds of this offering of the notes will be deposited into the Escrow
Account with the Escrow Agent on the Issue Date. The Escrow Agreement is more fully described below under “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event that the Merger Closing Date has not occurred
on or before January 31, 2024 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the notes
will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.” If this offering is consummated substantially concurrently with the Merger Closing Date, none of the
proceeds of this offering of the notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account with the Escrow Agent and such
proceeds will be provided to the Issuer on the Issue Date.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be payable, and the notes may be exchanged or
transferred, at the office or agency designated by the Issuer (which initially shall be the designated office or agency
of the Trustee).

The notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of
$2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; provided that notes may be issued in denominations of
less than $2,000 solely to accommodate book-entry positions that have been created by a participant of The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (“DTC”) in denominations of less than $2,000. No service
charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

**Terms of the Notes**

The notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer, will have the benefit of the security interests in the
Collateral described below under “—Security” and will mature on          , 2030. Each note will bear interest at
a rate of      % per annum from the Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or

157


-----

provided for, payable semiannually to holders of record at the close of business on         or
immediately preceding the interest payment date on         and         of each year, commencing       ,
2023.

**Optional Redemption**

On or after       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part
from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by the Issuer by first-class mail
to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, at the following redemption prices
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on         of the years set
forth below:

**Period** **Redemption Price**

2026 ..................................................................................................................................... %
2027 ..................................................................................................................................... %
2028 and thereafter .............................................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the notes at its option, in whole at any time or
in part from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by the Issuer by firstclass mail to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may
redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving
effect to any issuance of additional notes) in an amount not to exceed the amount of net cash proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings (1) by the Issuer or (2) by any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer to the extent the net cash
proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of the Issuer or used to purchase Capital Stock (other
than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount
thereof) of      %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving_
effect to any issuance of additional notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption (unless, in either
case, all notes are redeemed or repurchased, or are to be redeemed or repurchased, substantially concurrently);
_provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 180 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering_
is consummated upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice mailed by the Issuer to each holder of notes
being redeemed, or delivered electronically if held by DTC, and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the indenture.

The indenture shall also provide that, in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer (including a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer), if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written
notice to the holders (with a copy to the Trustee), given not more than 30 days following such purchase, to redeem
all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to the holders
in such offer (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer or
exchange offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Notice of any redemption upon any corporate transaction or other event (including any Equity Offering,
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction) may be given prior to the completion thereof. In
addition, any redemption described above or notice thereof may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more

158


-----

conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a corporate transaction or other event. If any
redemption is so subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the notice thereof shall describe
each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), and/or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption
date as so delayed, and/or that such notice may be rescinded at any time by the Issuer if the Issuer determines in its
sole discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). For the avoidance of doubt, if any
redemption date shall be delayed as contemplated by this paragraph and the terms of the applicable notice of
redemption, such redemption date as so delayed may occur, subject to the applicable procedures of DTC, at any time
after the original redemption date set forth in the applicable notice of redemption and after the satisfaction (or
waiver) of any applicable conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a date that is less than 10 days after
the original redemption date or more than 60 days after the applicable notice of redemption. In addition, the Issuer
may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

**Selection**

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee in
compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed
(and the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if the notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the
extent practicable or by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and, in such
manner that complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable); provided that no notes of a minimum of $2,000
or less shall be redeemed in part. Except with respect to a Special Mandatory Redemption, notices of redemption
will be mailed by first-class mail (or with respect to global notes, to the extent permitted or required by applicable
DTC procedures or regulations, sent electronically) at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date
to each holder of notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or
sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes
or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture or if the redemption date is delayed as described above. If any note is
to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such note shall state the portion of the principal
amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be
issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date,
interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuer has deposited
with the paying agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) on, the notes
to be redeemed.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except under the circumstances described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption,” the Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase notes as
described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” We may at any time,
and from time to time, purchase notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If this offering closes prior to the Merger Closing Date, concurrently with the closing of this offering of the
notes the Issuer will enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) among the Issuer, the Trustee and
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuer
will deposit or cause to be deposited the gross proceeds of this offering of the notes (the “Proceeds”) into the
Escrow Account, together with an additional amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents in an amount that, when taken
together with the Proceeds and with the rights to receive any cash and/or Cash Equivalents under one or more letters
of credit or one or more Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters, would be sufficient (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) to redeem the notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price thereof plus an amount equal to
the interest that would accrue on such notes to, but excluding, July 31, 2023. No later than the date that is three
Business Days prior to the last day of each month beginning with July 31, 2023 and ending with December 31, 2023

159


-----

(in each case, unless the Escrow Release Date or a Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and subject to the
immediately succeeding sentence), the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) to the Escrow Account an
additional amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal to the interest that would accrue on the notes to, but
excluding, the last day of the next succeeding month (in each case, as calculated in accordance with the terms of the
indenture). At the option of the Issuer, funds managed by Affiliates, or certain investment Affiliates, of the Sponsors
and the Co-Investors will (i) enter into one or more equity commitment letters pursuant to which they will, among
other things, agree to contribute cash and/or Cash Equivalents directly or indirectly to the Issuer in an amount equal
to all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in the
event that the Special Mandatory Redemption occurs (each, a “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letter” and
collectively, the “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters”) and/or (ii) in lieu of all or a portion of such
amount, deposit or cause to be deposited an amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents (either in the form of cash or
letters of credit). The Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters, if applicable, will automatically terminate on
the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the Special Mandatory Redemption and (ii) the date of satisfaction of
the Escrow Conditions (as defined below). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less
any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), are referred to, collectively, as the
“Escrowed Property.”

As long as Escrowed Property is deposited with the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property in such Cash Equivalents as the Issuer will from
time to time direct in writing. The Issuer will grant, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes, a firstpriority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property to secure the Notes Obligations pending
disbursement as described below. The ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon such funds or securities held
in the Escrow Account may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the
Issuer or the Escrow Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—If a bankruptcy or
reorganization case is commenced, the escrowed funds might be deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate
such that bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of funds in the escrow account and the holders of the notes might
become unsecured creditors.”

The Issuer may cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property by delivering to the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee, on or before the Escrow Outside Date, an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Officer’s
_Certificate”) instructing the Escrow Agent to release the escrowed funds and certifying to the effect that:_

(1) the Merger will be consummated on the date of release of the Escrowed Property in all
material respects as described under “Summary—The Transactions”;

(2) the Issuer has entered into the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility or will
substantially concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property enter into the Credit Agreement and
the ABL Facility; and

(3) equity investments in the Issuer, directly or indirectly, by funds affiliated with the
Sponsors and the Co-Investors will have been made and borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the
ABL Facility will be available in an aggregate amount sufficient, when taken together with the Escrowed
Property and the cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company, to consummate the Merger and to pay related
fees and expenses (clauses (1), (2) and (3), collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”).

In the event that upon the earliest of (x) the date on which the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that
the Escrow Conditions cannot be satisfied, (y) the end of the day on the Escrow Outside Date, if the Escrow
Officer’s Certificate has not been delivered by such time and (z) the date on which the Issuer notifies the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee in writing that (i) the Issuer will not pursue the consummation of the Merger and/or (ii) the
Merger Agreement has been validly terminated (such earliest date, the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will
be required to redeem all of the notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) on the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price.

The Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption to the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent, and mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically

160


-----

if held by DTC, no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date. Such notice will provide
that all of the notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the indenture on the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. In connection with such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrow Agent will release funds
from the Escrow Account to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall pay such amounts to the paying agent (if other than
the Trustee), in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption. Upon the deposit of funds sufficient to pay the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price in respect of the notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date with the Trustee or the paying agent on or before such date, the notes will cease to bear interest and all rights
under the indenture and the notes shall terminate.

If at any time the Escrow Account contains cash and Cash Equivalents having an aggregate value, together
with the amount of commitments under the Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters and the face amount of
any letters of credit, in excess of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, upon written instruction of the Issuer to
the Escrow Agent, such excess cash and Cash Equivalents may be released to (or at the direction of) the Issuer or the
amount of commitments under such Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters or the face amount of any such
letters of credit may be reduced. On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, upon written instruction of the Issuer,
the Trustee will pay to (or at the direction of) the Issuer any Escrowed Property in excess of the amount necessary to
effect the Special Mandatory Redemption, plus any outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee and Escrow Agent.

If the Issuer is able to consummate the Merger on the Issue Date, then the Issuer may elect to forego the
escrow procedures described above in their entirety, in which case there would be no Escrow Agreement, Escrow
Account or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Property) may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially adversely affect the holders of
the notes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) without the consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the notes then outstanding. No provisions of the indenture with respect to the Issuer’s obligation to
redeem the notes through a Special Mandatory Redemption may be amended or waived in a manner that would
materially adversely affect the holders of the notes without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note
affected.

“Escrow Account” means a segregated account that includes only cash and Cash Equivalents, the proceeds
thereof and interest earned thereon.

“Special Mandatory Redemption Date” means the fifth Business Day after the Special Termination Date.

“Special Mandatory Redemption Price” means a price equal to the issue price of the notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

**Activities Prior the Release of Escrow Proceeds**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the primary activities of the Issuer will be restricted to issuing the notes,
issuing Capital Stock to, and receiving capital contributions from, Holdings or any other parent entity, performing its
obligations in respect of the notes under the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, performing its obligations under
the Merger Agreement, redeeming the notes, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Transactions or to carry out the activities described above.

**Ranking**

The indebtedness evidenced by the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, respectively, will be senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors, respectively, will rank pari _passu in right of payment with_
all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors and will be senior in right of
payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors. In the
event that the Merger is not consummated on the Issue Date, the notes will have the benefit of a first-priority
security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property so long as the proceeds of any notes remain in
the Escrow Account. From and after the Escrow Release Date, pursuant to the Security Documents, the First Lien

161


-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will have
the benefit of (i) a first-priority security interest in the Notes Priority Collateral, which will also secure all other
First-Priority Obligations on a first-priority basis and the ABL Obligations on a junior-priority basis and (ii) a
second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral, which will also secure the ABL Obligations on a
first-priority basis and the First-Priority Obligations on a second-priority basis, in each case, subject to Permitted
Liens and exceptions described under the caption “—Security.” From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes
Obligations will rank effectively senior to the ABL Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority
Collateral, and effectively junior to the ABL Obligations, to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral.
From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes Obligations will be pari passu with all other First-Priority
Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral and the ABL Priority Collateral, will rank
effectively senior to all unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors and to all Indebtedness
of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors secured by junior liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to all future Indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Subsidiary Guarantors that is secured by assets or properties not constituting Collateral securing the notes.

At March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries would have had (a) approximately $4,100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Indebtedness constituting First-Priority Obligations, consisting of the notes and $2,300.0 million (equivalent)
outstanding under the Credit Agreement and (b) approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available and undrawn
under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing base availability of approximately
$1,307.2 million and after giving effect to approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the Merger
Closing Date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the Merger
Closing Date). Certain hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements that are entered into with the
lenders under the ABL Facility will be secured by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility.

Although the indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions. The Issuer and its Subsidiaries are able to Incur additional amounts of Indebtedness. Under certain
circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to certain limitations, such
Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness, including Secured Indebtedness constituting ABL Obligations or
additional First-Priority Obligations. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

Unless a Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary, including trade
creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the
notes. The notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to holders of indebtedness and other creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor.
As of the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer’s only Subsidiaries that will not be Subsidiary Guarantors will be
(i) Foreign Subsidiaries, (ii) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and (iii) Domestic Subsidiaries that (w) are Immaterial
Subsidiaries, (x) are prohibited by any applicable contractual requirement or requirement of law from guaranteeing
the notes on the Escrow Release Date or that would require consent, approval, license or authorization of a
Governmental Authority to guarantee the notes (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been
received), including special purpose Subsidiaries, (y) are FSHCOs or (z) are Subsidiaries of (A) any of the
Subsidiaries described in preceding clauses (ii) or (iii) or (B) any Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC.

As of March 31, 2023, on a historical basis, the Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries had approximately 36%
of the Issuer’s total assets and approximately $387.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany
obligations. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a historical basis, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries
would have generated approximately 34% of the Issuer’s total operating revenues and approximately 34% of the
Issuer’s Reported Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in this offering memorandum). The foregoing information with
respect to the non-guarantor Subsidiaries does not give effect to pro forma adjustments for the Transactions.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The notes will be structurally
subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

**Security**

From and after the Escrow Release Date, the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured by (i) a
first-priority security interest in the Notes Priority Collateral, which will also secure the Credit Agreement and all
Other First-Priority Obligations on a first-priority basis and the ABL Obligations on a junior-priority basis and (ii) a
second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral, which will also secure the ABL Obligations on a
first-priority basis and the Credit Agreement and all Other First-Priority Obligations on a second-priority basis, in
each case, subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions. The First-Priority Obligations and the ABL Obligations may
include certain Hedging Obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management services (including
bank products obligations). Holdings will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the
ABL Facility but will not guarantee the notes, and the equity interests of the Issuer pledged to secure Holdings’
obligations under such guarantee of the obligations under the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility will not secure
the notes. Holdings’ guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility is
recourse solely to the equity interests of the Issuer directly held by Holdings.

The “Notes Priority Collateral” will consist of substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and each
Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case whether owned on the Escrow Release Date or thereafter acquired, other than the
ABL Priority Collateral and any Excluded Property, including, but not limited to: (i) all the equity interests directly
held by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC or
any FSHCO, will be limited to 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of any non-voting capital stock of such
subsidiary) and (2) substantially all other material owned tangible and intangible assets of the Issuer and each
Subsidiary Guarantor.

The “ABL Priority Collateral” will consist of the following, whether now owned or at any time hereafter
acquired by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor: (a) all accounts, accounts receivables and credit card receivables
(except for accounts which constitute identifiable proceeds of real estate assets, intellectual property, fixtures or
equipment, and then only to the extent of such identifiable proceeds); (b) all inventory; (c) to the extent evidencing,
governing or securing the items referred to in the preceding clauses (a) and (b), all (i) general intangibles (other than
intellectual property and the equity interests of any Grantor’s subsidiaries), (ii) chattel paper, (iii) letter-of-credit
rights, (iv) commercial tort claims, (v) instruments and (vi) documents; (d) all loans receivable (other than
intercompany indebtedness), tax refunds and all other payment intangibles, including payment intangibles that
represent tax refunds (other than tax refunds in respect of or otherwise related to real estate assets, intellectual
property, fixtures or equipment and other than payment intangibles representing identifiable proceeds of real estate
assets, intellectual property, fixtures or equipment); (e) all collection accounts, deposit accounts, securities accounts
and commodity accounts and any cash or other assets in any such accounts (other than accounts solely holding
identifiable proceeds of real estate assets, intellectual property, fixtures or equipment) and securities entitlements
and other rights with respect thereto; (f) to the extent relating to any of the items referred to in the preceding clauses
(a) through (e) constituting ABL Priority Collateral, all supporting obligations; (f) all books and records related to
the foregoing; and (h) all products and proceeds of any and all of the foregoing in whatever form received, including
insurance proceeds and proceeds of business interruption insurance (in each case, except to the extent constituting
proceeds of real estate assets, intellectual property, fixtures or equipment).

The Collateral does not include, subject to certain exceptions, (i) any real property (owned or leased), other
than real property located in the United States owned in fee simple with a fair market value (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) of at least $30 million (on a per-property basis) as of (x) the Escrow Release Date, in the case of
fee owned real property owned on the Escrow Release Date or (y) the date of acquisition of such real property, in
the case of fee owned real property acquired after the Escrow Release Date, (ii) (1) motor vehicles and other assets
subject to certificates of title, (2) letter of credit rights (other than to the extent a Lien on such assets or such rights
can be perfected by filing a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement) and (3) commercial tort claims with a
value of less than $10 million, (iii) those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such
assets would be prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or contractual obligation (with respect to any such
contractual obligation, only to the extent such restriction is permitted under the indenture and such restriction is
(1) binding on such assets (x) on the Escrow Release Date or (y) on the date of the acquisition thereof and not
entered into in contemplation thereof (other than in connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness of the
type permitted under the indenture) or (2) entered into in connection with the incurrence of certain Indebtedness of
the type permitted under the indenture) (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after

giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or
which could require consent, approval, license or authorization of a Governmental Authority to be pledged (unless
such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received), (iv) assets to the extent a security interest in
such assets could reasonably be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith
by the Issuer in consultation with the Credit Agreement Agent, (v) any lease, license or other agreement to the extent
that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement, or create a
right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor) after
giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code,
(vi) [reserved], (vii) any “intent-to-use” applications for trademark or service mark registrations filed pursuant to
Section 1(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051, unless and until an Amendment to Allege Use or a Statement of
Use under Section 1(c) or 1(d) of the Lanham Act has been filed with or accepted by the United States Trademark
Office, (viii) other customary exclusions under applicable local law or in applicable local jurisdictions,
(ix) Securitization Assets sold to any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary or otherwise pledged, factored,
transferred or sold, including in connection with any Permitted Securitization Financing or other receivables sale or
financing not prohibited under the indenture, and any other assets subject to Liens securing Permitted Securitization
Financings or other receivables sales or financings not prohibited under the indenture, (x) any Excluded Securities
(as defined below), (xi) any Third Party Funds, (xii) so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset at any
time that is not then subject to a Lien securing First-Priority Obligations under the Credit Agreement at such time,
(xiii) so long as the ABL Facility (or any refinancing or replacement thereof) is outstanding, any asset that would
otherwise constitute ABL Priority Collateral that is not then subject to a Lien securing the obligations under the
ABL Facility at such time, (xiv) assets as to which the Credit Agreement Agent and the Issuer reasonably agree that
the cost or other consequence of obtaining such a security interest in favor of the First-Priority Secured Parties or
perfection thereof would be excessive in relation to the value afforded thereby, (xv) any equipment or other asset
subject to Liens securing acquired debt (limited to the acquired assets), sale and leaseback transactions, capital lease
obligations, finance lease obligations or other purchase money debt, in each case, permitted under the indenture, if
the contract or other agreement providing for such debt, sale and leaseback transaction, capital lease obligation,
finance lease obligation or purchase money debt prohibits or requires the consent of any Person (other than the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor) as a condition to the creation of any other security interest on such equipment or
asset and, in each case, such prohibition or requirement is permitted under the indenture (and after giving effect to
the applicable anti-assignment provisions under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law),
(xvi) payroll accounts and accounts holding withholding income taxes, employment taxes or other amounts to be
paid over to employee benefit accounts, (xvii) any governmental licenses or state, provincial, territorial, municipal
or local licenses, franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises,
charters or authorizations are prohibited or restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (xviii) certain other exceptions described in the
Security Documents, including the limitation on stock collateral described below (all such excluded assets referred
to as “Excluded Property”); provided, that any assets of the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors that secure (or
purport to secure) the ABL Obligations (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) shall not constitute
Excluded Property. “Excluded Securities” means (i) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness with respect to which the
Credit Agreement Agent and the Issuer reasonably agree that the cost or other consequences of pledging such Equity
Interests or Indebtedness in favor of the First-Priority Secured Parties under the Security Documents would be
excessive in relation to the value to be afforded thereby; (ii) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of
any Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC (in each case, that is owned directly by the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor),
any voting Equity Interest of such Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC in excess of 65% of such outstanding voting
Equity Interests; (iii) in the case of any pledge of voting Equity Interests of any FSHCO (in each case, that is owned
directly by the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor) any voting Equity Interest of such FSHCO in excess of 65% of
such outstanding voting Equity Interests; (iv) any Equity Interests or Indebtedness to the extent the pledge thereof
would be prohibited by any requirement of law after giving effect to the anti-assignment provision of the Uniform
Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction; (v) Equity Interests in any person other than Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent a pledge thereof is prohibited by (i) any applicable organizational documents,
joint venture agreement or shareholders’ agreement or (ii) any other contractual obligation with an unaffiliated third
party not in violation of the indenture binding on such Equity Interests to the extent in existence on the Escrow
Release Date or on the date of acquisition thereof and not entered into in contemplation thereof (other than in
connection with the incurrence of certain Indebtedness permitted under the indenture) or entered into in connection
with the incurrence of certain Indebtedness permitted under the indenture (other than non-assignment provisions
which are ineffective under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law); (vi) any Equity

164


-----

Interests of any Immaterial Subsidiary, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Special Purpose Securitization
Subsidiary; (vii) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of, or other Equity Interests owned by, an Excluded
Subsidiary; (viii) Equity Interests of any Subsidiary to the extent the pledge of such Equity Interest could reasonably
be expected to result in material adverse tax consequences to the Issuer (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer)
or any Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Issuer; (ix) so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any
Equity Interests otherwise excluded as collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (x) any Equity Interests or
Indebtedness that are set forth on a schedule to the Credit Agreement or that have been identified on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date in writing to the Credit Agreement Agent by a Responsible Officer of the Issuer and agreed to
by the Credit Agreement Agent; and (xi) any margin stock. No control agreements or control, lockbox or similar
arrangements will be required with respect to any deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodities accounts or
other assets. Furthermore, in no event shall (x) landlord, mortgagee or bailee waivers be required, (y) notices be
required to be sent to insurers, account debtors or other contractual third parties when no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or (z) security documents governed by a law other than the laws of the United States or
perfection under a law other than the laws of the United States be required. The foregoing Excluded Property (other
than stock collateral not subject to the limitations described below under “—Limitations on Stock Collateral”) will
not secure the Credit Agreement, the ABL Facility or any Other First-Priority Obligations.

The security interest in the Collateral securing the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be pari passu in
priority with any and all security interest in the Collateral securing other First-Priority Obligations, including the
Credit Agreement. In addition, the security interests in the Collateral securing the notes will also be subject to all
other Permitted Liens. The other Persons holding First-Priority Obligations may have rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the FirstPriority Collateral Agent under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on
behalf of the holders of the notes. In addition, the Persons holding ABL Obligations may have rights and remedies
with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the ABL Priority
Collateral or the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to realize or foreclose
on the ABL Priority Collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes. The First-Priority Collateral Agent and the ABL
Collateral Agent will also have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could also
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the holders of the notes to cause a realization or
foreclosure on the Collateral, particularly the covenants described below under “—Security—First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement” and “—Security—ABL Intercreditor Agreement.”

Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, in
connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding,
all proceeds of Notes Priority Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the First-Priority Collateral Agent
and any expenses of selling or otherwise foreclosing on the Notes Priority Collateral) will be applied pro rata to the
repayment of the obligations under the notes and the other outstanding First-Priority Obligations (including the
Credit Agreement) and all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the ABL
Collateral Agent and any expenses of selling or otherwise foreclosing on the ABL Priority Collateral) will be
applied to the repayment of the ABL Obligations prior to any repayment of the obligations under the notes and the
other outstanding First-Priority Obligations.

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future,
including Indebtedness that could share in the Collateral, including additional First-Priority Obligations and ABL
Obligations. The amount of such other First-Priority Obligations and ABL Obligations will be limited by the
covenant disclosed under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Under certain circumstances
the amount of such First-Priority Obligations, ABL Obligations and additional indebtedness could be significant.

**_Limitations on Stock Collateral_**

The Capital Stock and securities of a Subsidiary that are owned by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
will constitute Collateral only to the extent that such Capital Stock and securities can secure the notes or the
Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, without Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16, Rule 13.01 or Rule 13.02 of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act (or any other law, rule or regulation) requiring separate financial statements of such
Subsidiary to be filed with the SEC (or any other governmental agency). In the event that Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16,

165


-----

Rule 13.01 or Rule 13.02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires or is amended, modified or interpreted
by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted,
which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of
any Subsidiary due to the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities secure the notes or any Subsidiary
Guarantee, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be deemed not to be part
of the Collateral (but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement). In such event, the Security
Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of notes, to the extent
necessary to release the security interests on the shares of Capital Stock and securities that are so deemed to no
longer constitute part of the Collateral.

In the event that Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16, Rule 13.01 or Rule 13.02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any
other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities to secure
the notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency)
of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall
automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral (but only to the extent that will not result in such Subsidiary
being subject to any such financial statement requirement). In such event, the Security Documents may be amended
or modified, without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of notes, to the extent necessary to subject to the Liens
under the Security Documents such additional Capital Stock and securities, on the terms contemplated herein.

Because the notes do not have registration rights, this limitation will not limit the Collateral on the Escrow
Release Date.

**_After Acquired Collateral_**

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor creates any
additional security interest upon any property or asset (other than Excluded Property) to secure any First-Priority
Obligations or ABL Obligations (which include Obligations in respect of the Credit Agreement and ABL Facility), it
must concurrently grant a security interest with the priority required by the Notes Documents (subject to Permitted
Liens) upon such property as security for the notes. Also, if granting a security interest in such property requires the
consent of a third party, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent with respect to
the security interest for the benefit of the First-Priority Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of
the notes. If such third party does not consent to the granting of the security interest after the use of such
commercially reasonable efforts, the applicable entity will not be required to provide such security interest.

**_Security Documents_**

The Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the First-Priority Collateral Agent will enter into the Security
Documents on the Escrow Release Date defining the terms of the security interests that secure the notes and the
Subsidiary Guarantees. These security interests secure the payment and performance when due of all of the
Obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the indenture
and the Security Documents (and other First-Priority Obligations, which include Obligations in respect of the Credit
Agreement), as provided in the Security Documents.

We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to perfect all security interests in the Collateral on or prior
to the Escrow Release Date. With respect to any owned real properties to be mortgaged as security for the notes, if
any, mortgages may not be recorded prior to the Escrow Release Date, and with respect to any other Collateral in
respect of the notes, security interests may not be granted prior to the Escrow Release Date. In the event such
mortgages are not in place or actions to perfect a security interest in other Collateral have not been completed on or
prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause first-priority
mortgages to be recorded with respect to our owned real properties (other than Excluded Property) if any, and,
where applicable, to obtain title insurance policies insuring the first-priority mortgages on the properties, in each
case, subject to local law limitation in granting of security to more than one secured party, and to cause the taking of
additional actions required to perfect the security interest in the other Collateral required to be pledged hereunder, in
each case within 120 days following the Escrow Release Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date

-----

increases the risk that the mortgages or other security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in
bankruptcy.”

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the notes, to freely operate the Collateral
and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Trustee, the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement Agent”) and the
First-Priority Collateral Agent will enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement on the Escrow Release Date
with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time, without the consent of the Credit
Agreement Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes, to add other parties holding First-Priority Obligations not
prohibited under the indenture and the Credit Agreement.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will govern the relative rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, the holders of the notes and the holders of any Other FirstPriority Obligations. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, subject to the provisions set
forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, the “Applicable Authorized
Representative” has the right to direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent to foreclose on Common Collateral and
take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of
First-Priority Obligations have no right to so direct the First-Priority Collateral Agent or to take actions with respect
to the Common Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent,
and the Trustee for the holders of the notes, as Authorized Representative in respect of the notes, will initially have
no rights to take any action with respect to the Common Collateral under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The
First-Priority Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, at the request (and sole expense) of the Issuer,
each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any First-Priority Security Document
(including, without limitation, to release any Liens securing any Series of First-Priority Obligations), so long as such
amendment is not prohibited by the terms of each then extant First-Priority Obligations Document. The FirstPriority Collateral Agent may additionally enter into any amendment (and, at the request (and sole expense) of the
Issuer, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any First-Priority Security
Document solely as such First-Priority Security Document relates to a particular Series of First-Priority Obligations
(including, without limitation, to release Liens securing such Series of First-Priority Obligations); provided that any
such amendment is in accordance with the First-Priority Obligations Documents pursuant to which such Series of
First-Priority Obligations was incurred and such amendment does not adversely affect the First-Priority Secured
Parties of any other Series.

The Credit Agreement Agent will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of
(1) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
Enforcement Date (such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). From and after the Applicable Authorized
Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Non-Controlling
Secured Parties (the “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”) of the Series of First-Priority Obligations (other
than the Series constituting Obligations under the Credit Agreement) that constitutes the largest outstanding
principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First-Priority Obligations with respect to the Common Collateral
(the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”).

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days
(throughout which 180-day period the applicable Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major NonControlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an “Event of Default”, as defined in the
indenture or other applicable document or instrument for that Series of First-Priority Obligations, and (b) the FirstPriority Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that
Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major NonControlling Authorized Representative and that an Event of Default, as defined in the indenture or other applicable
document or instrument for that Series of First-Priority Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the FirstPriority Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or other applicable document or instrument for that Series of First
167


-----

Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be
stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred (and the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative shall cease its enforcement activities) with respect to any Common Collateral (1) at any time the
Credit Agreement Agent or the First-Priority Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to such Common Collateral (or is stayed or prohibited from such exercise pursuant
to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent then in effect) or any other applicable intercreditor agreement) or
(2) at any time the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common Collateral
is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to instruct the First-Priority Collateral
Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral. The First-Priority Collateral Agent shall
not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any Authorized Representative of any
Non-Controlling Secured Party or other First-Priority Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized
Representative), and no Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other First-Priority
Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the First-Priority Collateral Agent
to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver,
liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right,
remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or
take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Common Collateral, the First-Priority Collateral
Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Common
Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized
Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or any Non-Controlling Secured Party may contest, protest or
object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Applicable
Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party. The Trustee and each other Authorized Representative
will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Common Collateral for the benefit of the holders of notes or of any
other Series of First-Priority Obligations, as applicable (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance
of the indenture or other applicable document or instrument governing such other Series of First-Priority
Obligations, as applicable), other than pursuant to the First-Priority Security Documents. Each of the First-Priority
Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity
or enforceability of a Lien or claim held by or on behalf of any of the First-Priority Secured Parties in all or any part
of the Collateral or under its First-Priority Security Documents, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, if any Common Collateral is transferred to a
third party or otherwise disposed of in connection with any enforcement by the First-Priority Collateral Agent
thereunder, the Liens in favor of the First-Priority Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First-Priority
Secured Parties upon such Common Collateral will be automatically released and discharged.

If an Event of Default or any event of default with respect to any other First-Priority Obligations has
occurred and is continuing and the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority Secured Party is taking action
to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Common
Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any First-Priority Secured Party
receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement)
with respect to any Common Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such
Collateral by any First-Priority Secured Party or received by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any First-Priority
Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Common Collateral and proceeds of
any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to customary impairment
provisions, including the paragraph immediately following and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) to which the
First-Priority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among the FirstPriority Obligations to the payment in full of the First-Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all
amounts owing to the First-Priority Collateral Agent, in its capacity as such, and the Authorized Representatives, in
their capacity as such.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party (other than a
First-Priority Secured Party and after giving effect to any other applicable intercreditor agreements) has a lien or

168


-----

security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First-Priority Obligations but senior
(as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other
Series of First-Priority Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Common
Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely
from the Common Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First-Priority Obligations with
respect to which such impairment exists.

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy,
insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any other First-Priority
Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with
respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any
Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition or realization of such
Collateral. If any First-Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds
or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of First-Priority Obligations, then it
must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and
promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the First-Priority Collateral Agent to be
distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including any case or proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law). The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
holders of the notes will be subject to a turnover with respect to any such amounts otherwise received or receivable
by them in such proceeding to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of the foregoing, even if such turnover
has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the notes. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts
received or receivable by any Authorized Representative in respect of fees, expenses and indemnities (including,
without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel) shall not be subject to turnover. The First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement will further provide that, if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession,
move for approval of financing (the “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”)
under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code,
each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of any
Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object to (and not to otherwise contest), and will be deemed to have
consented to, any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the “DIP
_Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling_
Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to
such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured
Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on
the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing
Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First-Priority Obligations
of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to
such Common Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all
such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First-Priority Secured
Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as
existed prior to the commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional
collateral pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection
with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First-Priority Secured
Parties as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the
First-Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and

169


-----

(D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the
form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of
such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_
secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Priority Secured Parties of such
Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and provided, further, that the
First-Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party
receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties
in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First-Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First-Priority Obligations of any Series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other First-Priority Obligations Documents, be increased, extended,
renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or
modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any Series.

**_ABL Intercreditor Agreement_**

The First-Priority Collateral Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of holders of the notes and the other
holders of First-Priority Obligations (including the obligations under the Credit Agreement) and certain future Junior
Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the administrative agent and
lenders under the ABL Facility (together with the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the “Applicable Collateral
_Agents”), the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into the ABL Intercreditor Agreement on the Escrow_
Release Date that sets forth the relative priority of the Liens securing First-Priority Obligations and certain future
Junior Lien Obligations (the “Non-ABL Obligations”), on the one hand, compared to the Liens securing the ABL
Obligations (collectively, all such Non-ABL Obligations and ABL Obligations, the “Applicable Obligations”), on
the other hand. Although the holders of Non-ABL Obligations (including the holders of the notes) and ABL
Obligations will not be parties to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the instruments
evidencing such Obligations, each agrees to be bound thereby. In addition, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that it may be amended from time to time to add additional secured parties with respect to other Non-ABL
Obligations and ABL Obligations to the extent not prohibited to be incurred under the indenture, the ABL Facility
Documents and other agreements governing such Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will allocate the
benefits of any Collateral between the holders of the ABL Obligations on the one hand and the holders of the NonABL Obligations on the other hand.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things:

    - Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of
any Liens securing any ABL Obligations (the “ABL Liens”), the Liens securing any Non-ABL
Obligations (the “Non-ABL Liens”), the defects or deficiencies in any such Liens or other
circumstances whatsoever, (1) the ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral will rank senior to any
Non-ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, and (2) the Non-ABL Liens on the Notes Priority
Collateral will rank senior to any ABL Liens on the Notes Priority Collateral.

    - Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, and
no holder of, any class of Applicable Obligations may contest or support any other person in contesting
the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent
with respect to, or holder of, any other class of Applicable Obligations.

    - Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Prior to the
Discharge of the ABL Obligations, the ABL Collateral Agent will have the sole power to exercise
remedies against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the First-Priority Collateral Agent
to take limited protective measures with respect to the Non-ABL Liens and to take certain actions that
would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL

170


-----

Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral. Upon any
sale of any ABL Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such
ABL Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on such
item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item
of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released.

    - Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the Notes Priority Collateral. Prior to the
Discharge of the Non-ABL Obligations, the First-Priority Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of
the Applicable Authorized Representative) will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the
Notes Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the ABL Collateral Agent to take limited protective
measures with respect to the ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken
by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose
upon and dispose of the Notes Priority Collateral. Upon any sale of any Notes Priority Collateral in
connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such Notes Priority Collateral that results in
the release of the Liens of such First-Priority Collateral Agent on such item of Notes Priority
Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of Notes Priority
Collateral will be automatically released.

    - Application of Proceeds and Turn-Over Provisions. In connection with any enforcement action with
respect to the Collateral or including in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (x)(1) all
proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all ABL Obligations in
accordance with the ABL Facility, before being applied to any Non-ABL Obligations; and (2) after the
Discharge of ABL Obligations, if any Non-ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of ABL
Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Non-ABL Obligations in
accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable
intercreditor agreement; and (y)(1) all proceeds of Notes Priority Collateral shall be applied to NonABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other
applicable intercreditor agreement, before being applied to the ABL Obligations; and (2) after the
Discharge of Non-ABL Obligations, if any ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of Notes
Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding ABL Obligations in accordance
with the ABL Facility. If any holder of any Applicable Obligations or if any Applicable Collateral
Agent receives any proceeds of Collateral in contravention of the foregoing, such proceeds will be
turned over to the Applicable Collateral Agent entitled to receive such proceeds pursuant to the prior
sentence, for application in accordance with the prior sentence.

    - Amendment and Refinancings. The ABL Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations may be amended
or refinanced subject to continuing rights of the holders of such refinancing Indebtedness under the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable
intercreditor agreement.

    - Tracing of Proceeds. Each Applicable Collateral Agent will agree, that prior to any issuance of notice
of an exercise of remedies by any other Applicable Collateral Agent (unless a bankruptcy or
insolvency event of default then exists), any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited under
control agreements, which are used by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to acquire other property
which is Collateral shall not (solely as between the Collateral Agents) be treated as proceeds of
Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral which was so acquired.

In addition, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law:

    - if the ABL Collateral Agent desires to permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to obtain
financing secured by a lien on ABL Priority Collateral to be provided by one or more lenders under
Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral
under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, then the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of
Non-ABL Obligations agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the ABL Priority

Collateral securing the same or to any use of such cash collateral that constitutes ABL Priority
Collateral, unless the ABL Facility Agent shall then oppose or object to such financing or such liens or
use of such cash collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral, or to request adequate protection
(except as otherwise permitted under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) or any other relief in
connection therewith (and (i) to the extent that such DIP financing liens are senior to the Liens on any
such ABL Priority Collateral for the benefit of the ABL Facility Secured Parties, each Non-ABL
Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral on the same
terms as the Liens of the ABL Facility Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any ABL Facility
Secured Party constituting DIP financing liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such
DIP financing liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such ABL Priority Collateral granted to
secure the ABL Obligations of the ABL Facility Secured Parties, each Non-ABL Secured Party will
confirm the priorities with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral as set forth in the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case so long as (A) the Non-ABL Secured Parties retain the benefit of their Liens
on all such ABL Priority Collateral pledged to the DIP lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after
the commencement of such proceeding (other than any Liens constituting DIP financing liens) as
existed prior to the commencement of such bankruptcy case, (B) the Non-ABL Secured Parties are
granted junior Liens on any additional ABL Priority Collateral pledged to any ABL Facility Secured
Party as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP financing or use of such cash
collateral, (C) if any amount of such DIP financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the
ABL Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, and (D) if any
ABL Facility Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic
payments, in connection with such DIP financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such
adequate protection are applied pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;

- the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and will
not otherwise contest (i) any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against
foreclosure or enforcement in respect of the ABL Obligations made by the ABL Collateral Agent or
any holder of such ABL Obligations, (ii) any lawful exercise by any holder of ABL Obligations of the
right to credit bid ABL Obligations in any sale in foreclosure of collateral securing such ABL
Obligations; (iii) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any holder of ABL
Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral; (iv) any sale
or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code if the ABL Collateral Agent or the
holders of ABL Obligations shall have consented to such sale or disposition of the ABL Priority
Collateral; and (v) any order relating to a sale of assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
constituting ABL Priority Collateral for which the ABL Collateral Agent has consented which
provides that, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, the Liens securing the ABL
Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of
priority as the Liens securing such Obligations on the assets being sold, in accordance with the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement;

- the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not seek relief from
the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the
ABL Priority Collateral without the prior consent of the ABL Collateral Agent or oppose any request
by the ABL Collateral Agent for relief from such stay with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral;

- the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and will
not otherwise contest (or support any other person contesting) (a) any request by the ABL Collateral
Agent or the holders of ABL Obligations for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority
Collateral or (b) any objection by the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of ABL Obligations to any
motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of ABL
Obligations claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of ABL
Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection with respect to ABL Priority
Collateral in the form of additional collateral in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash
collateral under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar law, then the First
172


-----

Priority Collateral Agent may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a replacement Lien on
such additional collateral, so long as such Lien is subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority
Collateral securing the ABL Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto),
on the same basis as the other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Obligations are
subordinated to the Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Obligations under the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the event the First-Priority Collateral Agent seeks or requests
adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of additional collateral, then
the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations agree that the holders of
the ABL Obligations shall also be granted a Lien on such additional collateral as security for the ABL
Obligations and any such DIP Financing and that any Lien on such additional collateral that constitutes
ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Obligations shall be subordinated to the Liens on such
collateral securing the ABL Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating
thereto) and any other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral granted to the holders of ABL Obligations as
adequate protection on the same basis as the Non-ABL Liens are so subordinated to the Liens securing
the ABL Obligations under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; and

    - neither the First-Priority Collateral Agent nor any other First-Priority Secured Party shall (i) oppose or
seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Collateral Agent or any holder of ABL Obligations for
allowance of ABL Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or expenses to the extent of the
value of the ABL Collateral Agent’s Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral, without regard to the
existence of the Lien of the First-Priority Secured Parties on the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) until
the Discharge of ABL Obligations has occurred, assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code senior or on parity with the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the
ABL Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be
enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also contain similar reciprocal restrictions on the ABL Collateral
Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations applicable during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for customary access and use of the Notes Priority
Collateral for purposes of exercising remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and that the ABL
Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations shall be deemed separate classes of secured obligations.

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors are entitled to the automatic release of property and other assets
included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the notes and any Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, under any
one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable us to consummate the disposition of such property or assets to a Person that is
not the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales”;

(2) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the designation of
such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted
Subsidiary”;

(3) in respect of the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release or
discharge of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the indenture;

(4) in respect of any property and assets of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor that would
constitute Collateral but is at such time not subject to a Lien securing First-Priority Obligations (other than

173


-----

the Notes Obligations), other than any property or assets that cease to be subject to a Lien securing FirstPriority Obligations in connection with a Discharge of First-Priority Obligations; provided that if such
property and assets (other than Excluded Property) are subsequently subject to a Lien securing FirstPriority Obligations (other than the Notes Obligations), such property and assets shall subsequently
constitute Collateral under the indenture;

(5) in respect of any Collateral transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of in
connection with any enforcement by the First-Priority Collateral Agent or the ABL Collateral Agent, as
applicable, as described under “—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement” and “—ABL Intercreditor
Agreement” above;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below;

(7) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents; and

(8) in respect of any property and assets that are or become Excluded Property pursuant to a
transaction not prohibited under the indenture.

The security interests in all Collateral securing the notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of
the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the notes and all other Obligations under the indenture
and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as described below
under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the indenture as
described below under “—Defeasance.”

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Issue Date occurs prior to the Merger Closing Date), the notes will
not be guaranteed by any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. From and after the Escrow Release Date, each of the Issuer’s
direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded
Subsidiary) and that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement will jointly and severally, irrevocably
and unconditionally, guarantee on a senior secured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether
at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the indenture and the notes,
whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the notes, expenses, indemnification or
otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantors being herein called the “Guaranteed
_Obligations”). The Guaranteed Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor will be secured by a first-priority security_
interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Notes Priority Collateral owned by such Subsidiary Guarantor and by a
second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such
Subsidiary Guarantor. Such Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and
all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee in enforcing any rights under
the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such
Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and
the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and guarantees
and any related security interests and require noteholders to return payments received.” After the Escrow Release
Date, the Issuer will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an
Excluded Subsidiary) that Incurs or guarantees certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary
Guarantors to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes on the same senior secured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future
Subsidiary Guarantors.”

174


-----

Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall:

(1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment in
full of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Subsidiary
Guarantor and its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors,
transferees and assigns.

Each Subsidiary’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically released upon any of the following:

(1) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock (including any sale, disposition,
exchange or other transfer following which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary), of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer is
made in a manner not in violation of the indenture;

(2) (i) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii) the occurrence of any other event following which
such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in a manner not in violation of the
indenture;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the notes;

(4) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Defeasance” or if the Issuer’s obligations under the indenture are discharged in
accordance with the terms of the indenture;

(5) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or
security interest in favor of the First-Priority Obligations or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof,
subject to, in each case, the application of the proceeds of such foreclosure or exercise of remedies in the
manner described under “—Security”;

(6) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that following a Reversion
Date, if any, each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be reinstated to the extent and within the timeframe required
under the fifth paragraph under “—Certain Covenants” and “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary
Guarantors”;

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with and
into the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary or upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case, in a manner not in violation of the indenture; and

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to

175


-----

the extent the Issuer has previously or concurrently elected to redeem notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption.”

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right
to redeem the notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer
shall mail to each holder’s registered address, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, with a copy to the Trustee a
notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the
Issuer to repurchase such holder’s notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the
right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts constituting such Change of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically), except in the case of a conditional Change of
Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below (in which case the expected
repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that is
expected to result in the Change of Control and which may be tolled until the closing of such transaction);
and

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a holder
must follow in order to have its notes purchased.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the
Change of Control Offer.

In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of notes issued
but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party
pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of notes issued and outstanding.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof.

This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial
purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it
is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer
could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, securitizations or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating.

The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain
events that could constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of
Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the notes upon a

176


-----

Change of Control could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not
cause a default under such Indebtedness, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the
Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial
resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to
repurchase the notes upon a change of control.”

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or
substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body
of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” under New York law, which governs the indenture, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to
require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may
be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the indenture. If on any date
following the Issue Date, (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default
has occurred and is continuing under the indenture then, beginning on such date (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the
covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering
memorandum will not be applicable to the notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Asset Sales;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets;” and

(7) “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the notes
will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing,
and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment
Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture with
respect to future events. The period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is
referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Subsidiary Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors
will be suspended during the Suspension Period.

The Issuer will provide the Trustee with written notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion
Date within five Business Days of the occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of

177


-----

the notes or monitor or provide notice to the holders of the notes of the occurrence of any such Covenant Suspension
Event or Reversion Date.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during
the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted
under clause (c) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be
made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not
during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not
reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments. Any Affiliate Transactions entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period (to the extent that such
agreement was not entered into in contemplation of such Reversion Date) shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant
to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates.”

As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the
Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension
Period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, the Issuer must comply with the terms of the covenant described
under “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.”

For purposes of the “—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds
amount will be reset to zero.

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

For purposes of determining compliance as of any date with the indenture (other than for purposes of
calculating financial ratios or as set forth in the second to last paragraph set forth in “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or the definition of “Consolidated Total
Indebtedness”), amounts incurred, invested, loaned, advanced, acquired, disposed of, sold, declared, paid,
distributed or otherwise made or outstanding in any currency other than the applicable currency in which such
basket, threshold or other amount is denominated shall be calculated based on exchange rates in effect on the date of
incurrence, investment, loan, advance, acquisition, disposition, sale, declaration, payment, distribution or other
similar action was taken (or committed, at the option of the Issuer) as determined in good faith by the Issuer. If any
limitation, threshold, ratio or basket is exceeded solely as a result of changes in currency exchange rates after the last
time it was utilized, such limitation, threshold, ratio or basket will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a
result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates. No Default or Event of Default shall arise as a result of any
limitation, threshold, ratio or basket in the indenture (or in the definition of any defined term used in such sections)
being exceeded solely as a result of changes in currency exchange rates.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The indenture will provide that:

(1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified
Stock; and

(2) the Issuer will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (other than a Subsidiary
Guarantor) to issue any shares of Preferred Stock;

_provided, however, that the Issuer and any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a
Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock
or issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case (x) if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer for the Pro
Forma Period immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such

178


-----

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma
basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been
Incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of
proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such Pro Forma Period or (y) if the Total Indebtedness
Leverage Ratio of the Issuer as of the date such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is issued, and after giving pro forma effect thereto and the application of the net proceeds therefrom,
does not exceed 5.50 to 1.00 (plus, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing
Amount).

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(a) (1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness (including
under any Credit Agreement and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at the time of Incurrence that does not exceed
an amount equal to the sum of (x) the sum of (A) $2,300 million, plus (B) the greater of $1,205 million and
1.25 multiplied by the Pro Forma EBITDA of the Issuer for the Pro Forma Period immediately preceding
such date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if
such event occurred at the beginning of such Pro Forma Period (plus, in the case of any Refinancing
Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount), plus (y) an additional aggregate principal amount of
Consolidated Total Indebtedness that at the time of Incurrence does not cause the Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio of the Issuer, determined on a pro forma basis, to exceed 5.00 to 1.00 (plus, in the case of any
Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount); provided that for purposes of determining
the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred under this clause (a)(1)(y), all Indebtedness Incurred
under this clause (a)(1)(y) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof pursuant to clause (o) below) shall be
treated as Secured Indebtedness constituting First-Priority Obligations; provided, further, that in connection
with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness under this clause (a)(1)(y) in connection with an acquisition of
assets or Equity Interests, merger, consolidation or amalgamation or other Investment or New Project
permitted under the indenture (i) such Indebtedness shall be permitted to be Incurred under this clause
(a)(1)(y) notwithstanding the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio at such time if the Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio of the Issuer on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or other Investment or New Project and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof and any related transactions would be no greater than the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio
of the Issuer immediately prior thereto and (ii) the calculation of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio in
connection therewith shall disregard an aggregate outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock not to exceed the greater of $973 million and 1.00
multiplied by the Pro Forma EBITDA of the Issuer for the Pro Forma Period immediately preceding such
date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued
and (2) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness under any ABL Facility
and issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder up to an aggregate
principal amount outstanding at the time of Incurrence that does not exceed an amount equal to the greater
of (A) the Borrowing Base at the time of Incurrence after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence and
the application of the net proceeds therefrom, and (B) the sum of (x) $1,400 million, plus (y) the greater of
$973 million and 1.00 multiplied by the Pro Forma EBITDA of the Issuer for the Pro Forma Period
immediately preceding such date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred and after giving pro
forma effect thereto as if such event occurred at the beginning of such Pro Forma Period (plus, in each case,
in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount);

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors of Indebtedness, including
Indebtedness represented by the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, up to an aggregate principal amount
outstanding at the time of Incurrence that does not exceed $1,800 million;

(c) (i) Indebtedness existing on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clauses
(a) and (b) above) and (ii) Indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries existing on the Merger Closing
Date to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement;

179


-----

(d) (1) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, Disqualified Stock issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and Preferred
Stock issued by any Restricted Subsidiary to finance (whether prior to or within 365 days after) the
acquisition, lease, construction, installation, maintenance, service, repair, replacement, remodeling,
modernization, upgrade, development, expansion, update or improvement of property (real or personal),
equipment or other assets (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person
owning such assets) in an aggregate principal amount that, when aggregated with the principal amount or
liquidation preference of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock then outstanding and
Incurred pursuant to this clause (d)(1), together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof
Incurred pursuant to clause (o) below, does not exceed the greater of $485 million and 0.50 multiplied by
the Pro Forma EBITDA of the Issuer for the Pro Forma Period immediately preceding such date on which
such additional Indebtedness is Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, and after
giving pro forma effect thereto as if such event occurred at the beginning of such Pro Forma Period (plus,
in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, the Additional Refinancing Amount); and

the “Deemed Date” hereunder), and any related subsequent actual Incurrence or issuance and granting of

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of
letters of credit or similar obligations relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness;
_provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee, letter of credit or similar obligation,_
as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness or Liens, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of any Indebtedness or Lien denominated in a
foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness or Lien was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields
the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness or Lien is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness or a Lien denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness or Lien does not exceed the
outstanding or, if greater, committed principal amount of the Indebtedness or Lien being refinanced plus the
Additional Refinancing Amount.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness or Liens that
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur under the indenture shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with
respect to any outstanding Indebtedness or Liens, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.
The principal amount of any Indebtedness or Lien Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness or a Lien, if Incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness or Lien being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness or Lien is denominated that is in
effect on the date of the refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to,

with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving the Issuer (other than (A) dividends or
distributions payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or
(B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or
distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of Equity Interests issued by a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives
at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such
class or series of Equity Interests);

(2) purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Issuer;

categories of permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any portion
thereof) described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to the clauses set forth in the definition of “Cumulative Credit”), the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, divide,
classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such permitted Restricted Payment (or any portion
thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the
time of division, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such
Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories
of permitted Restricted Payments (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investments (or any portion thereof)
described in the above clauses or the definitions thereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
clauses set forth in the definition of “Cumulative Credit”). In the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion
thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified in reliance on the
“Cumulative Credit” or clause (21) above or clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” (collectively,
the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that
may be made pursuant to the Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially
concurrent Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) divided,
classified or reclassified under any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an Incurrence Clause or
the incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any such Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted
Investment (or any portion thereof). In the event a Restricted Payment or Investment permitted under clause (4) or
(8) above or the definition of “Permitted Investment” is permitted up to an amount per annum, any unused amounts
in any calendar year shall be permitted to be carried over to any subsequent calendar year.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or similar event
relating to the payment or making of an Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event, the
Issuer or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other
relevant event as having occurred on the date of the commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or
similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) (or, at the election of the Issuer or applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, on any date subsequent thereto, even if a prior date was previously the Election Date
hereunder, in which case from and after such election such subsequent date shall be deemed the “Election Date”
hereunder) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant
event and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or
other relevant event on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the indenture, and any related subsequent
actual declaration, payment or making of such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event
will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including, without
limitation, for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if
applicable) and EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and
all such calculations on and after such Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction
or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or similar event shall be made
on a pro forma basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all
outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary
so designated on such date of designation will be deemed to be an Investment in an amount determined as set forth
in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted
Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

Notwithstanding any of the definitions or covenants contained in this “Description of Notes” to the
contrary, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any transaction that
results in the transfer (whether by way of any Restricted Payment, Investment, or any disposition, whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions), directly or indirectly, of the ownership of the Univar
Trademarks to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

(8) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm;

other capital or finance lease obligations in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the
nature discussed in clause (c) above on the property so acquired;

into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm;

license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license (including, without
limitation, licenses of intellectual property) or other contracts;

(12) any encumbrances or restrictions contained in any Permitted Securitization Document
with respect to any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary;

(13) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (a) of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary or (b) of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary so long as, in the case of this clause
(b), either (x) such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument will not
materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make anticipated principal or interest payments on the
notes as and when they come due (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (y) such encumbrances and
restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance
covenant relating to such Indebtedness; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue

Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (1) through
(14) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more

or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing;

stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination
of loans or advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or
any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to,
cause or make an Asset Sale, unless (x) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by
the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale,
together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet or in the notes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in
the notes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet,
as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their
terms subordinated to the notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such
assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in
connection with the transaction with such transferee;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of the receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash or Cash
Equivalents received);

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the Asset Sale;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other
than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer), taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause
(e) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $340 million and 0.35 multiplied by the Pro
Forma EBITDA of the Issuer for the Pro Forma Period immediately preceding the receipt of such
Designated Non-cash Consideration and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such event occurred at
the beginning of such Pro Forma Period (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in
value),

shall in each case be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

Within 18 months after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sale, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at
its option:

(1) to repay (i) Indebtedness constituting First-Priority Obligations (and, if the Indebtedness
repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), (ii)
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, (iii) Obligations under the notes,
(iv) other Pari Passu Indebtedness other than First-Priority Obligations so long as the Net Proceeds are with
respect to assets not constituting Collateral (provided that, if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall so
reduce Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness that does not constitute First-Priority Obligations under
this clause (iv) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include Indebtedness described in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (v) even if such Indebtedness may also constitute Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuer will

197


-----

equally and ratably reduce Notes Obligations either, as the Issuer shall elect in its sole discretion, as
provided under “Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are
at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, in the event that the notes were issued with significant
original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase a pro rata principal amount of
notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event that the notes were
issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any), or (v) if all or any portion of such proceeds are from an Asset Sale of ABL Priority
Collateral (including indirect Asset Sales of ABL Priority Collateral due to the sale of the Capital Stock of
a Person), any Indebtedness under the ABL Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require a
reduction of the commitments thereunder); or

(2) to make an acquisition or investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such
investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition results in such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or in an increase in the percentage ownership by the
Issuer (or a Restricted Subsidiary) in such Restricted Subsidiary), assets, or property or capital expenditures
or New Projects, in each case (a) used or useful in a Similar Business or (b) that replace the properties and
assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or, in each case, to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing
incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Proceeds was contractually
committed, or to make an investment in one or more New Projects, or to make acquisitions or investments
not prohibited by the indenture.

In the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application from the
date of such commitment until the 24-month anniversary of the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds; provided
that in the event such binding commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason after the 18-month
anniversary of the receipt of such Net Proceeds but before an amount equal to such Net Proceeds is so applied, then
such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into
another binding commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within six months of such cancellation or termination of the
prior binding commitment; provided, further, that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may only enter into a
Second Commitment under the foregoing provision one time with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such
Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before an amount equal to such Net Proceeds is
applied or is not applied within six months of such Second Commitment, then such unapplied amount shall
constitute Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any amount, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may use such amount
in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. If the Issuer has not applied an amount equal to such Net Proceeds
from any Asset Sale as provided and within the time period set forth in the two immediately preceding paragraphs of
this covenant, then, in lieu of applying such amount in such manner, such unapplied amount (it being understood
that any amount used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have
been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted and such amount shall not constitute Excess Proceeds (any
amounts that do not constitute Excess Proceeds as a result of this parenthetical, “Retained Asset Sale Proceeds”))
will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that, if (i) the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of the Issuer
is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00 but greater than 3.75 to 1.00 at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds or at any
time during such time period, an amount equal to 50% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall not be
required to be applied as set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) above and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and 50%
of any existing Excess Proceeds shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds, and (ii) the Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio of the Issuer is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00 at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds or at any time
during such time period, none of the amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall be required to be
applied as set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) above or constitute Excess Proceeds and any existing Excess Proceeds
shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds (any amounts that do not constitute Excess Proceeds, or no longer
constitute Excess Proceeds, as a result of the application of clause (i) or clause (ii) of this proviso, together with any
Retained Asset Sale Proceeds, “Available Proceeds”). If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
$200 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all holders of notes (and, at the option of the Issuer, to holders of any
other First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral,
other Pari Passu Indebtedness) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (and
such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness), that is a minimum principal amount of $2,000 and

198


-----

an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event the notes or such First-Priority
Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the
accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such First-Priority Obligations or
other Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be offered to the holders of such First-Priority
Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness), to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds $200 million by mailing, or delivering electronically if held by DTC, the notice required pursuant
to the terms of the indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option, satisfy the foregoing
obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by
making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as provided
above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $200 million or less (it being understood that such amount used to
make an Asset Sale Offer shall satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such amount of Net Proceeds
whether or not such Asset Sale Offer is accepted and shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds). The Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may use any Available Proceeds and, to the extent that the aggregate amount of notes (and
such First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral,
other Pari Passu Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any such amounts (“Declined Proceeds”), in each case, for any purpose that
is not prohibited by the indenture and shall not be required to use them for any other purpose. If the aggregate
principal amount of notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness) surrendered by
holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall select the notes to be purchased in the
manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any Declined Proceeds upon such completion).

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the indenture by virtue thereof.

If more notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets
not constituting Collateral, other Pari Passu Indebtedness) are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the
Issuer is required to purchase, selection of such notes for purchase will be made by the Issuer in compliance with the
requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed (and the Issuer shall
notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable,
by lot or by such other method as the Issuer deems appropriate (and in such manner as complies with the
requirements of DTC, if applicable); provided that no notes of a minimum of $2,000 or less shall be purchased in
part. Selection of such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be made pursuant to the terms
of such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by the Issuer by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or
delivered electronically if held at DTC, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder
of notes at such holder’s registered address, with a copy to the Trustee. If any note is to be purchased in part only,
any notice of purchase that relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or
is to be purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or
assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of
transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate

199


-----

of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of
$50 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, when taken
as a whole, to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $150 million, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a resolution
adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, approving such Affiliate
Transaction accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies
with clause (a) above.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (or an
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and any merger, consolidation or
amalgamation of the Issuer and any direct parent of the Issuer; provided that such parent shall have no
material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the
Issuer and such merger, consolidation or amalgamation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the
indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

(2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the indenture described above under

to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair, when
taken as a whole, to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the
requirements of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

(5) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) to officers, directors, employees or
consultants which are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(6) any agreement as in effect as of the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date or any
amendment thereto (so long as any such agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole,
is not materially adverse to the holders of the notes than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue
Date or the Escrow Release Date, as applicable, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or any
transaction contemplated thereby;

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its
obligations under the terms of, any stockholders or other agreement (including any registration rights
agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it (or any parent of the Issuer) is a party as of
the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date, and any transaction, agreement or arrangement described in this
offering memorandum and, in each case, any amendment thereto or similar transactions, agreements or
arrangements which it (or any parent of the Issuer) may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the
existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under, any
future amendment to any such existing transaction, agreement or arrangement or under any similar

200

transaction, agreement or arrangement entered into after the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date, as
applicable, shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such existing
transaction, agreement or arrangement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new
transaction, agreement or arrangement are not otherwise materially adverse to the holders of the notes than
the original transaction, agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date or the Escrow Release
Date or described in this offering memorandum, as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(8) the execution of the Transactions, and the payment of all fees, expenses, bonuses and
awards related to the Transactions, including fees to the Co-Investors;

purchasers or sellers of goods or services, or transactions otherwise relating to the purchase or sale of goods
or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm
and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture, which are fair to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of the
Issuer, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party or (b) transactions with joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm;

(22) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a responsible financial or

(23) (x) investments by Affiliates of the Issuer in securities or loans of the Issuer or any

or more favorable terms and (ii) the investment constitutes less than 10% of the proposed or outstanding
issue amount of such class of securities or loans and (y) payments to Affiliates of the Issuer in respect of
securities or loans or other investments of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary contemplated in the
foregoing subclause (x) or that were acquired from Persons other than the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the terms of such securities or loans or other investments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing covenant, the Co-Investors and their respective Affiliates, or any portfolio
company that is an Affiliate of the Co-Investors, shall in each case not be considered an Affiliate of the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries with respect to any transaction so long as such transaction is in the ordinary course of business or
pursuant to an operations management agreement, management services agreement, transition services agreement,
license agreement, commercial agreement, supply agreement, shared services agreement or other similar agreement
entered into with the Issuer and/or its Subsidiaries or, in each case, amendments, modifications or supplements
thereto or replacements thereof that are not materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries (as
determined by the Issuer in good faith).

**_Liens_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly
or indirectly, create or Incur any Lien (except Permitted Liens) on any asset or property of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
(or any portion thereof) need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof
and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or
more of the categories of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens”,
the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if
Incurred at such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant and at the time of Incurrence, division, classification or reclassification will be
entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any
portion thereof) in one of the categories of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of
“Permitted Liens” and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be
treated as being Incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving

202


-----

_pro forma effect to such item (or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any_
portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or any portion thereof) at such time.
In addition, with respect to any Indebtedness that is designated to be Incurred on any date pursuant to clause (3) of
the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” any Lien that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be
designated by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to be Incurred on such date and, in such event, any related
subsequent actual Incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be Incurred on
such prior date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien” until such time as the related
Indebtedness is no longer deemed outstanding pursuant to clause (3) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest (including capitalized interest), the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms or in the form of common stock of the Issuer, the payment of dividends
on Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock of the same class, accretion of original issue
discount or deferred financing costs or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness described in clause (3) of the definition of “Indebtedness.”

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The indenture will provide that, so long as any notes are outstanding, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a
copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, annual reports of the Reporting Entity (as defined below) for such fiscal year containing
the information that would have been required to be contained in an annual report on Form 10-K (or any
successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange
Act, except to the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, quarterly reports of the Reporting Entity for such fiscal quarter containing the
information that would have been required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q (or any
successor or comparable form) if the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange
Act, except to the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for filing
current reports on Form 8-K, current reports of the Reporting Entity containing substantially all of the
information that would be required to be filed in a current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on
the Issue Date pursuant to Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 5.02(a), (b) and (c) of
Form 8-K if the Reporting Entity had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided,
_however, that no such current reports (or Items thereof or all or a portion of the financial statements that_
would have otherwise been required thereby) will be required to be delivered (or included) if the Issuer
determines in its good faith judgment that such event (or information) is not material to holders or the
business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

In addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuer shall make available to the holders,
prospective investors and market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the notes and, subject to the consent
of the Issuer, securities analysts the information required to be provided pursuant to clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this
paragraph, by posting such information to its website (or the website of any of the Issuer’s parent companies,
including the Reporting Entity) or on IntraLinks or any comparable online data system or website. If at any time the
Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer has made a good faith determination to file a registration

203


-----

statement with the SEC with respect to an Equity Offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Issuer will not be
required to disclose any information or take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Issuer, would violate
securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on such Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) neither the Issuer nor another Reporting Entity will be required to
deliver any information, certificates or reports of the type that would otherwise be required by (i) Section 302 or
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K or (ii) Item 10(e) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-generally accepted accounting principles financial
measures contained therein, (b) such reports will not be required to contain financial statements or information of
the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16, Rule 13.01 or Rule 13.02 of Regulation S-X or include any
exhibits or certifications required by Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K (or any successor or comparable forms) or
related rules under Regulation S-K, (c) such reports shall be subject to exceptions, exclusions and other differences
consistent with the presentation of financial and other information in this offering memorandum and shall not be
required to present compensation or beneficial ownership information, (d) no such report will be required to include
as an exhibit, or to include a summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement,
plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of its parent entities or Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or
executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its parent entities or Subsidiaries), (e) trade secrets and other proprietary
information may be excluded from any disclosures, (f) such information will not be required to contain any
“segment reporting”, (g) no financial statements or financial information of the type required by Item 9.01 of Form
8-K shall be required, (h) with respect to the Merger or any acquisition or Investment consummated after the Issue
Date, the financial statements delivered pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be
required to reflect purchase accounting adjustments relating thereto until the next delivery of financial statements
under clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant and (i) no such information or report will be required to
include any disclosures on environmental, social and corporate governance data or “ESG reporting.”

The financial statements, information and other documents required to be provided as described above may
be those of (i) the Issuer or (ii) any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer (any such entity described in clause (i) or
(ii) that provides such financial statements, information or other documents, a “Reporting Entity”), so long as in the
case of clause (ii) either (1) such direct or indirect parent of the Issuer shall not conduct, transact or otherwise
engage, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage, in any material business or operations other than its
direct or indirect ownership of all of the Equity Interests in, and its management of, the Issuer or (2) if otherwise, the
financial information so delivered shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the quantitative
differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

In addition, the Issuer will make such information available electronically to prospective investors upon
request. The Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding during any period when neither it
nor another Reporting Entity is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish
the SEC with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, it will furnish to the holders of
the notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls, beginning with the first full fiscal quarter ending after
the Escrow Release Date, for all holders of the notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial
purchaser of the notes and, subject to the consent of the Issuer, securities analysts to discuss such financial
information no later than ten business days after the distribution of such information required by clause (1) or clause
(2) of the first paragraph of this covenant and, prior to the date of each such conference call, will announce the time
and date of such conference call and either include all information necessary to access the call or inform holders of
the notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the notes and, in the sole
discretion of the Issuer, securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the
applicable password or login information (if applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have delivered such reports and information
referred to above to the holders, prospective investors, market makers, securities analysts and the Trustee for all
purposes of the indenture if the Issuer or another Reporting Entity has filed such reports with the SEC via the
EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such reports are publicly available. In addition, the

204


-----

requirements of this covenant will be deemed satisfied and the Issuer will be deemed to have delivered such reports
and information referred to above to the Trustee, holders, prospective investors, market makers and securities
analysts for all purposes of the indenture by the posting of reports and information that would be required to be
provided on the Issuer’s website (or that of any of the Issuer’s parent companies, including the Reporting Entity).
The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor whether the Issuer posts such reports, information and documents
on the Issuer’s website (or that of any of the Issuer’s parent companies, including the Reporting Entity) or the SEC’s
EDGAR service, or collect any such information from the Issuer’s (or any of the Issuer’s parent companies’)
website or the SEC’s EDGAR service. The Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility for the content, filing or
timeliness of any report delivered or filed under or in connection with the indenture or the transactions contemplated
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no reporting shall be required prior to the Escrow Release Date, (ii)
the time requirement set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall be satisfied if the annual
report for the 2023 fiscal year is delivered within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year and (iii) the time
requirement set forth in clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant in respect of the first three quarterly reports
required to be delivered under this covenant shall be satisfied if such quarterly reports are delivered within 90 days
after the end of such fiscal quarter.

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors_**

The indenture will provide that the Issuer will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Domestic Subsidiary and not an Excluded Subsidiary and that guarantees or becomes a borrower under the Credit
Agreement or that guarantees any other Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary
Guarantors with a principal amount of $10 million or more to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes and joinders to or new
Security Documents and take all actions required thereunder to perfect the liens created thereunder to the extent
required under the Notes Documents. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee,
as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the indenture described
under “—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

- **Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The indenture will provide that, subject to certain provisions in the indenture governing release of assets
and property securing the notes, the Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or
into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving or continuing Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions
to, any Person unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving or continuing Person or the Person formed by or surviving or
continuing any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or winding up (if other than the Issuer) or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing under the laws
of a Permitted Jurisdiction (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of
the Issuer under the indenture, the notes and the relevant Security Documents, as applicable, pursuant to a
supplemental indenture or other applicable documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

205


-----

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma Period (and treating any Indebtedness which
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction), either:

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to either test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Successor Company would be no less
than such ratio immediately prior to such transaction; or

(c) the Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio of the Successor Company would be no
greater than such ratio immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) if the Issuer is not the Successor Company, each Subsidiary Guarantor, unless it is the
other party to the transactions described above, shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its
Subsidiary Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the indenture and the notes; and

(6) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such
supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the indenture.

The Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under
the indenture, the notes and the Security Documents, as applicable, and in such event the Issuer will automatically
be released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture, the notes and the Security Documents, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may
merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary
and (b) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of
reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer in another state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any
territory of the United States (collectively, “Permitted Jurisdiction”) or may convert into a corporation, partnership
or limited liability company, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is
not increased thereby. This “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”
will not apply to any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Permitted Securitization
Financings.

The indenture will further provide that, subject to certain provisions in the indenture governing release of
assets and property securing the notes and Subsidiary Guarantees and release of a Subsidiary Guarantee upon the
sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Subsidiary Guarantor and other release
provisions, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate,
amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving or
continuing Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) either (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving or continuing Person or the Person
formed by or surviving or continuing any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or winding up (if other
than such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made is a company, corporation, partnership or limited liability company or
similar entity organized or existing under the laws of a Permitted Jurisdiction (such Subsidiary Guarantor
or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Subsidiary Guarantor”) and the
Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture, the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantee and the
relevant Security Documents, as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other applicable

206


-----

documents or instruments, or (b) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is not
in violation of the covenant described above under the caption “—Asset Sales”; and

(2) the Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall have
delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any)
comply with the indenture.

Subject to certain provisions described in the indenture, the Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (if other than
such Subsidiary Guarantor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture,
the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantee and the Security Documents, as applicable, and such Subsidiary Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture, the notes, its Subsidiary
Guarantee and the Security Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing
such Subsidiary Guarantor in a Permitted Jurisdiction or may convert into a limited liability company, corporation,
partnership or similar entity organized or existing under the laws of any Permitted Jurisdiction so long as the amount
of Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not increased thereby and (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate, amalgamate or merge
with or into or wind up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

- **Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will be defined in the indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any note when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or
the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to
the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the provisions of
the indenture described in “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”;

(4) the failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice
given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then
outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with its other obligations, covenants or agreements
(other than a default referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) contained in the notes or the indenture;

(5) the failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay any Indebtedness
for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any
Permitted Securitization Financing) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the
acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total
amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $150 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary);

207


-----

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of $150 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are
covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged,
waived or stayed for a period of 60 days (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) a material portion of the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the notes provided by the
Subsidiary Guarantors cease to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or
shall be asserted in writing by any Subsidiary Guarantor not to be in effect or not to be legal, valid and
binding obligations (other than in accordance with the terms thereof);

(9) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the indenture,
the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the
Liens in favor of the holders of the notes with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be
valid or enforceable and such Default continues for 30 days; or

(10) the failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice to
the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor with its other agreements contained in the Security Documents
except for a failure that would not be material to the holders of the notes and would not materially affect
the value of the Collateral taken as a whole.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and
whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order
of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (3), (4), (9) or (10) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee
notifies the Issuer or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuer,
with a copy to the Trustee, of the default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause
(3), (4), (9) or (10) hereof after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the holders of at least
30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes by notice to the Issuer, with a copy to the Trustee, may
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on all the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on
the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of
outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of
Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived
and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within 30 days
after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the
Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof
have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default
or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall
an acceleration of the principal amount of the notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the
happening of any such events.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the indenture or the Security Documents at the request or direction of any of the
holders unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory
to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,

208


-----

premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes
unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered and, if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not
such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such holders) or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to
it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust
Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must mail, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, to each holder of the notes
notice of the Default within the later of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer
or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
premium (if any) or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver
to the Trustee, annually, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred
during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or
Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its
office specified in the indenture and such notice references the notes and the indenture and states that it is a “Notice
of Default.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to
provide a notice of Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the Trustee or holders of the notes (or any
other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to
holders of the notes, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the
Trustee to provide a notice of default or notice of acceleration (or other action).

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture, the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Security Documents,
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, if applicable,
may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding and
any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in

209


-----

principal amount of the notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note
affected, no amendment may:

(1) reduce the amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any note;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the dates on
which any such premium is payable upon redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” above;

(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in such note;

(6) expressly subordinate the notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee to any other Indebtedness of
the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor;

(7) impair the contractual right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such holder’s note on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s note; or

(8) make any change in the amendment provisions or in the waiver provisions which require
each holder’s consent.

Except as expressly provided by the indenture, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, without the consent of the holders of at least 66.67% in an
aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may release all or substantially
all of the Collateral from the Lien of the indenture and the Security Documents with respect to the notes.

Without the consent of any holder, the Issuer, the First-Priority Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent, as applicable, may amend the indenture, the notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Security
Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for the assumption by a
Successor Company (with respect to the Issuer) of the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture, the notes, the
Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and/or the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement; (3) to provide for the assumption by a Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (with respect to any Subsidiary
Guarantor), as the case may be, of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture, the notes, the
Security Documents and its Subsidiary Guarantee; (4) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of
certificated notes (provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f)
of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code); (5)
to add a Subsidiary Guarantee or collateral with respect to the notes; (6) to release or subordinate Collateral as
permitted by the indenture, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (7) to add additional secured creditors holding other First-Priority
Obligations, Junior Lien Obligations or ABL Obligations so long as such obligations are not prohibited by the
indenture; (8) to add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (9) to make any change that would provide any additional
rights or benefits to the holders or that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer); (10) to conform the text of the indenture, Subsidiary Guarantees, the notes,
the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement to any provision of this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of
Notes” was intended by the Issuer to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the indenture, Subsidiary Guarantees,
the notes, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, as applicable, as stated in an Officer’s Certificate; (11) to comply with any requirement of the
SEC in connection with the qualification of the indenture under the TIA (if the Issuer elects to qualify the indenture
under the TIA); (12) to effect any provision of the indenture; (13) to make certain changes to the indenture to

210


-----

provide for the issuance of additional notes; or (14) to add provisions to the indenture and a new form of note to
permit the issuance by the Issuer or a Subsidiary thereof of escrow notes under the indenture, which may have
different terms than other notes issued under the indenture so long as the proceeds of such notes remain in escrow
(including, but not limited to, separate collateral, different or no guarantees and special mandatory redemption
provisions).

In addition, no provision of the indenture with respect to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the notes through
a Special Mandatory Redemption may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially adversely affect the
holders of the notes without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note affected. The consent of the
noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Managers and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator or holder of any Equity Interests in the Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent companies, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor under the notes, the indenture or the Subsidiary Guarantees, as applicable, or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes.
The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Transfer and Exchange**

permitted by the indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any notes selected for redemption or to
transfer or exchange any notes for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of notes to be redeemed or between a
record date and the relevant payment date. The notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a
note will be treated as the owner of such note for all purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights,
indemnities and immunities of the Trustee and rights of registration or transfer or exchange of notes, as expressly
provided for in the indenture) as to all outstanding notes when:

(1) either (a) all the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or
destroyed notes which have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore
been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or
discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes not
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable
at their stated maturity within one year or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Issuer, are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the
entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit (in the case of notes that have become due
and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as applicable, together with irrevocable written
instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or
redemption, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit will be set
forth in a written notice delivered to the holders and the Trustee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
redemption date) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of the redemption;

211


-----

(2) the Issuer and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors have paid all other sums due and payable
under the indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
stating that all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture have been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its obligations under the notes and the indenture with respect to
the holders of the notes (“legal defeasance”), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the notes. The Issuer at any time may
terminate its obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” for the benefit of the holders
of the notes, the operation of clauses (3), (4), (5), (6) (with respect to Significant Subsidiaries), (7) and (8) under “—
Defaults” and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” (“covenant defeasance”) for the
benefit of the holders of the notes. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance
option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary
Guarantee and the Security Documents.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of the covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment
of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5), (6) (with respect
only to Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8), (9) or (10) under “—Defaults” or because of the failure of the Issuer to
comply with clause (4) under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets.”

In order to exercise its defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations in an amount that is sufficient for the payment of_
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply
with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that beneficial
owners of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case
of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law); provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of
the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit will be set forth in a written
notice delivered to the holders and the Trustee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the redemption date) only
required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of the redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Opinion of Counsel required by the immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not
be delivered if all of the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and
payable or (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year under arrangements satisfactory
to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Collateral Agent**

the Issuer as registrar and a paying agent with regard to the notes. Wilmington Trust, National Association will also

“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of (i) EBITDA
of such Person for such period to (ii) the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period (excluding Fixed Charges in
respect of Excluded Revolving Loans and Excluded Transaction Debt). In the event that the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, repays, repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness (other than in the case of any
Permitted Securitization Financing, in which case interest expense shall be computed based upon the average daily
balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period) or issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being
calculated but prior to the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed
_Charge Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to_
such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption
of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma
Period.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, capital expenditures,
constructions, repairs, replacements, improvements, equipment optimization programs, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) and
any operational changes, business realignment projects or cost savings initiatives or other initiatives, New Projects,
restructurings or reorganizations that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has determined to make or implement
and/or has made or implemented during the applicable Pro Forma Period or subsequent to such period and on or
prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Calculation Date (each, for purposes of this definition, a “pro
_forma event”) shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, capital expenditures,_
constructions, repairs, replacements, improvements, equipment optimization programs, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational changes, business
realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations (and the change of any associated
fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred (or such operational or cost
savings had been realized) on the first day of the applicable Pro Forma Period. If since the beginning of such Pro
Forma Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, consolidated or
amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period shall have made
any Investment, capital expenditure, construction, repair, replacement, improvement, equipment optimization
program, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, discontinued operation, operational change,
business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or reorganization that would have required
adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, capital expenditure, construction, repair, replacement,
improvement, equipment optimization program, acquisition, disposition, discontinued operation, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project,
restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma Period. If since the
beginning of such Pro Forma Period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any
Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable Pro Forma Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
_forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer. Any_
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the
Issuer, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings
reasonably expected to result from the applicable event (including, to the extent applicable, the Transactions), (2) all
adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as set forth in
footnote 1 to the “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” under “Summary”
in this offering memorandum to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such
Pro Forma Period (other than the “Normalization of supply chain disruption and destocking” adjustment, which
shall only be applicable for the year ended December 31, 2022 (and quarters within such year) and not applied to
any period thereafter) and (3) anticipated run-rate EBITDA reasonably expected to be achieved (in the good faith
determination of the Issuer) from New Projects (and the achievement of related operating expense reductions and
other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings associated therewith) so long as such New Project is then
under development or is otherwise in process.

231


-----

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Calculation Date had been the applicable
rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such
Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall
be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during
the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been
based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may
designate.

For purposes of this definition, except as otherwise provided in the indenture, any amount in a currency
other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the
most recent twelve-month period immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner consistent with that
used in calculating EBITDA for the applicable period.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum, without duplication, of:

premiums) of such Person for such period, and (2) all cash dividend payments (excluding items eliminated in
consolidation) on any series of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in such other statements by such
other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession, which are in effect on the
later of the Issue Date or the Escrow Release Date; provided that for financial reporting purposes, GAAP shall mean
GAAP as in effect from time to time. At any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to (i) change all terms
under GAAP to be GAAP in effect from time to time and (ii) change all terms under GAAP to be GAAP in effect as
of a certain date, in each case, by giving notice of such election and the effective date of such election to the Trustee.
For the purposes of the indenture, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person shall mean such Person
consolidated with its Restricted Subsidiaries, and shall not include any Unrestricted Subsidiary, but the interest of
such Person in an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be accounted for as an Investment.

ordinary course of business), direct or indirect, in any manner (including, without limitation, letters of credit and
reimbursement agreements in respect thereof), of all or any part of any Indebtedness or other obligations. The

anticipated liability in respect thereof as determined by such person in good faith.

mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational changes, business
realignment projects or initiatives, New Projects, restructurings or reorganizations (and the change of any associated

consolidation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New Project, restructuring or
reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma Period. If since the beginning of such Pro

designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then Pro Forma EBITDA shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for
such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
_forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer. Any_

shall only be applicable for the year ended December 31, 2022 (and quarters within such year) and not applied to
any period thereafter) and (3) anticipated run-rate EBITDA reasonably expected to be achieved (in the good faith
determination of the Issuer) from New Projects (and the achievement of related operating expense reductions and
other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings associated therewith) so long as such New Project is then

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Pro Forma EBITDA Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if
such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation
shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during
the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been
based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may
designate.

calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, capital expenditure, construction,
repair, replacement, improvement, equipment optimization program, acquisition, disposition, discontinued
operation, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, New
Project, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Pro Forma Period. If since
the beginning of such Pro Forma Period any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any
Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, then the Total Indebtedness Leverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable Pro Forma Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro
_forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer. Any_
such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the
Issuer, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings
reasonably expected to result from the applicable event (including, to the extent applicable, the Transactions), (2) all
adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as set forth in
footnote 1 to the “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” under “Summary”
in this offering memorandum to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such
Pro Forma Period (other than the “Normalization of supply chain disruption and destocking” adjustment, which
shall only be applicable for the year ended December 31, 2022 (and quarters within such year) and not applied to
any period thereafter) and (3) anticipated run-rate EBITDA reasonably expected to be achieved (in the good faith
determination of the Issuer) from New Projects (and the achievement of related operating expense reductions and
other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings associated therewith) so long as such New Project is then
under development or is otherwise in process.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such
Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Total Indebtedness Leverage Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized
Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance
with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a
revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of
such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall

253


-----

be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen
as the Issuer may designate.

For purposes of this definition, except as otherwise provided in the indenture, any amount in a currency
other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the
most recent twelve-month period immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner consistent with that
used in calculating EBITDA for the applicable period.

“Transactions” means the transactions described under “Summary—The Transactions.”

“Treasury Rate” means, as of the applicable redemption date, as determined by the Issuer, the yield to
maturity as of such redemption date of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and
published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at
least two business days prior to such redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published or the
applicable information is no longer available thereon, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most
nearly equal to the period from such redemption date to     , 2026; provided, however, that if the period from
such redemption date to     , 2026 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actively traded United States
Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used.

“Trust Officer” means any officer:

(1) within the corporate trust department of the Trustee, including any vice president,
assistant vice president, assistant secretary, assistant treasurer, trust officer or any other officer of the
Trustee who customarily performs functions similar to those performed by the Persons who at the time
shall be such officers, respectively, or to whom any corporate trust matter is referred because of such
person’s knowledge of and familiarity with the particular subject, and

(2) who shall have direct responsibility for the administration of the indenture.

“Trustee” means the party named as such in the indenture until a successor replaces it and, thereafter,
means the successor.

“Univar Trademarks” means the following trademarks filed with the Patent and Trademark Office:

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means:

(1) any Subsidiary of the Issuer that at the time of determination shall be designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary by the Board of Directors of the Issuer in the manner provided below; and

(2) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly acquired or newly formed
Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless at the time of such designation such Subsidiary or any of its
Subsidiaries owns any Equity Interests or Indebtedness of, or owns or holds any Lien on any property of, the Issuer
or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated, in each
case at the time of such designation; provided, however, that (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated and its
Subsidiaries do not at the time of designation have and do not thereafter Incur any Indebtedness pursuant to which
the lender has recourse to any of the assets of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries unless otherwise
permitted under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and (ii) the Issuer may not designate any Subsidiary of the
Issuer to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; provided, further, however, that either:

(a) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total consolidated assets of $1,000 or less; or

254


-----

(b) if such Subsidiary has consolidated assets greater than $1,000, then such designation
would be permitted under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.”

The Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Event of Default shall have occurred as a result of such
designation.

“U.S. Government Obligations” means securities that are:

(1) direct obligations of the United States of America for the timely payment of which its full
faith and credit is pledged, or

(2) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or
instrumentality of the United States of America, the timely payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed
as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America,

which, in each case, are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a
depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to
any such U.S. Government Obligations or a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S.
Government Obligations held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided
that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to
the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government
Obligations or the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S. Government Obligations evidenced by
such depository receipt.

“Voting Stock” of any Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the time
entitled to vote in the election of the Board of Directors of such Person.

“Weighted Average Life to Maturity” means, when applied to any Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or

number of years from the date of determination to the date of each successive scheduled principal payment of such
Indebtedness or redemption or similar payment with respect to such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock multiplied
by the amount of such payment, by (2) the sum of all such payments.

“Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary” is any Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary.

“Wholly Owned Subsidiary” of any Person means a Subsidiary of such Person 100% of the outstanding

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

The certificates representing the notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons.
Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act initially will be represented by permanent global notes
in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited with the
Trustee as a custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary.

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act initially will be
represented by temporary global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Temporary
Regulation S Global Note”) and will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and
registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of
this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “distribution
compliance period”), a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be held only through
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, societe
_anonyme (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through_
a Restricted Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. Each Temporary
Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for a single permanent global note (each, a “Permanent Regulation S
Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a “Regulation S Global Note” and
together with the Restricted Global Note, the “Global Notes”) after the expiration of the distribution compliance
period and the certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a beneficial interest in the Temporary
Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the
Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional
buyer, or QIB, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global
Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note
whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

The Global Notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on
transfer set forth therein and in the indenture governing the notes and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions
set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions” herein. QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take a
Certificated Security (as defined below under “—Certificated Securities”) instead of holding their interests through
the Global Notes, which certificated notes will be ineligible to trade through DTC (collectively referred to herein as
the “Non-Global Purchasers”) only in the limited circumstances described below. Upon the transfer to a QIB of any
Certificated Security initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee
requests otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be
exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes. For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated
Securities and any interest in the Global Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

**The Global Notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes,
DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial
interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such
depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the
transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to
interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants).
Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through
participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in
such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the
case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all
purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that
interest except in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if

256


-----

applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to
the notes.

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC
or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying
agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account
of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and
interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its
nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held
through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such
payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds
system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the
presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if
there is an event of default under the indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated
Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading
“Transfer Restrictions.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York
banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants
deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities
transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between
participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include
both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain
other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and nonU.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

257

**Certificated Securities**

A Global Note is exchangeable for certificated notes in fully registered form without interest coupons
(“Certificated Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:

    - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note and we fail
to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice, or

    - there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default with respect to the notes under the
indenture and DTC shall have requested the issuance of Certificated Securities.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer
Restrictions.” In no event shall the Regulation S Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Securities prior to (a) the
expiration of the distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions
of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities
that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer the notes will be limited to such extent.

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation
S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the
effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of
Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the distribution
compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule
144 (if available).

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the
Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC participant
through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer,
appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note
and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an
interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other
procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The
policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global
Note prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period.

258


-----

**Certification by Holders of the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes must provide Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture certifying that the beneficial
owner of the interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that
has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities
Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the Trustee (or the paying agent if other than
the Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a
beneficial interest in the Permanent Regulation S Global Notes.

**Same-Day Settlement and Payment**

Payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note
holder. With respect to any notes in certificated form, we will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and
interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof or, if no
such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the
Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted
secondary market trading activity in such Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement
date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders and non-U.S.
Holders (each as defined below and collectively referred to as “Holders”) of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the notes. This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated or proposed thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”),
administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this offering memorandum and all of
which are subject to change (perhaps with retroactive effect).

This summary addresses only Holders who acquire the notes for cash at original issue and at their original
“issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of
the notes is sold to the investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agencies or wholesalers) and hold their notes as “capital assets”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not
describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders in light of their particular
circumstances or to Holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks or
other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, individual retirement and
other tax deferred accounts, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a
mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or other pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein), tax-exempt entities, U.S. expatriates, U.S.
Holders that hold notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary, non-U.S. trusts and estates that
have U.S. beneficiaries, persons holding notes in a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction or as a position in a
constructive sale or straddle, persons subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. Holders whose
“functional currency” is other than the U.S. dollar or persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of
gross income with respect to the notes as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial
statement. This summary does not address any U.S. federal tax other than income tax (such as estate, gift or other
non-income tax), or state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the
notes. We have not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with
respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. As a result, there can be no assurance
that the IRS or a court will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions we have reached and describe
herein.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and under the
control of one or more U.S. persons, or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is for
U.S. federal income tax purposes an individual, corporation, trust or estate and that is not a U.S. Holder.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax treatment of a
partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
Entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are considering an investment in the
notes, as well as the beneficial owners of any such entity should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular
U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

260


-----

**This summary does not constitute, and should not be considered as, legal or tax advice to Holders of**
**the notes. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the application of the tax**
**considerations discussed below to their particular situations as well as the application of any state, local, non-**
**U.S. or other tax laws, including U.S. federal tax laws other than relating to income taxes (such as U.S. federal**
**gift and estate tax laws).**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the notes, including as
described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” These potential payments may implicate the
provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to the applicable
Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment
debt instrument if such contingencies in the aggregate, as of the date of issuance, are remote or incidental. We
believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental in the aggregate,
and, accordingly, we do not intend to treat the notes as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position that such
contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a Holder, unless such Holder discloses its contrary position in
the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the
IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a Holder might be required to accrue interest income on the notes
at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a note as
ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible
application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders**

**_Stated Interest_**

Generally, stated interest payments on a note to a U.S. Holder will be taxable as ordinary income at the
time they accrue or are received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**_Taxable Dispositions_**

Generally, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note will result in
taxable gain or loss to a U.S. Holder equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the disposition
(excluding amounts attributable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed as ordinary income to
the extent not previously so taxed) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The amount realized will
equal the sum of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received on the disposition (excluding
amounts attributable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note will
generally equal the cost of such note to such U.S. Holder. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss
and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the note is held for more than one year. Certain non-corporate
U.S. Holders (including individuals) are eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in respect of longterm capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Additional Tax on Passive Income_**

U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts, and whose income exceeds certain thresholds, are
required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other items, interest income and capital gains from the sale or
other taxable disposition of a note, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. U.S. Holders should consult their
own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this additional tax on their ownership and disposition of a note.

261


-----

**Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Stated Interest_**

Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), U.S. federal
income and withholding tax generally will not apply to a non-U.S. Holder in respect of any payment of interest on
the notes, provided that such payment is not effectively connected with such non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S.
trade or business and such non-U.S. Holder:

    - does not own actually or constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes
of the Issuer’s voting equity interests within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations;

    - is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer under the applicable provisions of the
Code;

    - is not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code;
and

    - provides identifying information (i.e., name and address) to the applicable withholding agent on IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), and certifies, under penalty of perjury, that such
non-U.S. Holder is not a U.S. person.

If a non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such
non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such non-U.S. Holder provides the
applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form),
as applicable, claiming an exemption from or reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax under an applicable income
tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to U.S.
federal withholding tax because it is effectively connected with such non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or
business (in which case such interest will be subject to tax as discussed below).

**_Dispositions_**

Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding and FATCA, any gain recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note by a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax (except to the extent attributable to any accrued and unpaid
interest, which will be taxable as described above) unless (1) such gain is effectively connected with such non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (in which case such gain will be subject to tax as described below under
“—Effectively Connected Income”) or (2) such non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States
for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met (in which case such
gain, net of certain U.S.-source losses, if any, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (or a
lower applicable income tax treaty rate)).

**_Effectively Connected Income_**

If interest on a note or gain from the disposition of a note is effectively connected with a non-U.S. Holder’s
conduct of a U.S. trade or business, such non-U.S. Holder will, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise, be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest or gain on a net income basis in generally the same
manner as if such non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if such non-U.S. Holder is treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower
applicable income tax treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to
certain adjustments.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at the rate of
24%) with respect to payments of stated interest and payments of the gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note. Certain U.S. Holders (including corporations) are
generally not subject to information reporting and backup withholding. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup
withholding if such U.S. Holder is not otherwise exempt and such U.S. Holder:

    - fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), which, for an individual, is
ordinarily his or her social security number;

    - fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not
notified the U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding (including because it has previously
failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends); or

    - otherwise fails to comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding, the
availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if
available.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

In general, a non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24%) with
respect to payments of interest if such non-U.S. Holder provides to the applicable withholding agent the statement
described above under “—Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders—Stated Interest” or the
non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. A non-U.S. Holder may, however, be subject to information
reporting requirements with respect to payments of interest on the notes.

Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes made to
or through a foreign office of a foreign broker without certain specified connections to the United States generally
will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. A non-U.S. Holder may be subject to backup
withholding and/or information reporting with respect to the proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption
or other taxable disposition of a note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial
intermediaries, unless the payor receives the statement described above under “—Certain U.S. Federal Tax
Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders—Stated Interest,” or such non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an
exemption.

**_General—U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders_**

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a credit against a Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and may entitle a Holder to a refund,
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) impose a 30% withholding tax on certain types of
payments made to a foreign financial institution (whether such institution is the beneficial owner or an
intermediary), unless the foreign financial institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the
Treasury to, among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned entities,
annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose
actions prevent it from complying with these and other reporting requirements, or unless the foreign financial
institution is otherwise exempt from those requirements. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on the

263


-----

same types of payments to a non-financial foreign entity (whether such entity is the beneficial owner or an
intermediary) unless the entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners, the entity furnishes
identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner or an exemption applies. Failure to comply with the
additional certification, information reporting and other specified requirements imposed under FATCA could result
in the 30% withholding tax being imposed on payments of interest under the notes and gross proceeds of a sale or
disposition of the notes held by or through a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity. In
December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released proposed Treasury Regulations which, if finalized in
their present form, would eliminate the U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% applicable to the gross proceeds of a
sale or disposition of debt instruments. In its preamble to the proposed Treasury Regulations, the U.S. Department of
the Treasury stated that taxpayers generally may rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have entered into
intergovernmental agreements with the United States in connection with FATCA may be subject to different rules.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA and its effect on them.

**CERTAIN ERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS**

The United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the
corollary provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, impose certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA and plans, arrangements, and accounts that
are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, including entities such as collective investment funds, separate
accounts and insurance company general accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans
(collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. The U.S.
Department of Labor has promulgated regulations 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, which were effectively modified
by Section 3(42) of ERISA, describing what constitutes the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to the ERISA
Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA and the Code, including the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be
a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements,
including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s
investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and applicable provisions of
ERISA and the Code. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an
ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances
of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in
the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes.
Similar requirements may apply to investments by plans, arrangements, or accounts, such as governmental plans,
certain church plans, and non-U.S. plans, and entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts
whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans, arrangements, or accounts (collectively, “Other Plan
Investors”), that are subject to laws, regulations, or policies that are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code (“Similar Laws”).

Each ERISA Plan and Other Plan Investor should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial
purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) will act as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan
or Other Plan Investor with respect to the decision to acquire notes or an interest in a note pursuant to this offering
and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect
to such decision. The decision to acquire notes or an interest in a note must be made by each prospective ERISA
Plan and Other Plan Investor purchaser on an arm’s-length basis.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain
relationships to such ERISA Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A
party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction with an ERISA Plan may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition,
a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan who caused the ERISA Plan to engage in such non-exempt prohibited transaction
may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise
if the notes or an interest in a note are acquired with the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer,
the initial purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person.
Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of ERISA Plan fiduciary making the decision to
acquire a note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTCE
90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments
by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset
managers) (collectively, “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available
under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a party in interest or disqualified person
that is a service provider to an ERISA Plan investing in securities for adequate consideration, provided such service

265


-----

provider is not (i) the fiduciary with respect to the ERISA Plan’s assets used to acquire the securities or an affiliate
of such fiduciary or (ii) an affiliate of the employer sponsoring the ERISA Plan (the “Service Provider
Exemption”).However, there can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider
Exemption, or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the notes.

Other Plan Investors, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the
prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to
Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before acquiring the notes.

**Representations and Further Considerations**

By its acquisition of notes or any interest in a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee thereof will
be deemed to have represented and warranted either that (a) it is not an ERISA Plan or an Other Plan Investor
subject to any Similar Law and is not using the assets of an ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor to acquire or hold a
note, or (b) its acquisition and holding of a note or any interest in a note will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a violation of Similar Laws, and
none of the Transaction Parties is acting as its fiduciary in connection with its investment in the notes pursuant to
this offering.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Neither this discussion
nor anything provided in this offering memorandum is or is intended to be investment advice directed at any
potential ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor purchasers or at ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor purchasers
generally. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in nonexempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that any fiduciary of an ERISA Plan or Other Plan
Investor or other person who proposes to use assets of any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor to acquire the notes or
any interest in a note should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, and any applicable Similar Laws, to such an
investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws.

The sale of the notes or any interest in a note, to an ERISA Plan, an Other Plan Investor, or to a person
using assets of any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor to effect its acquisition of the notes, is in no respect a
representation or recommendation by the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee or any of their respective
affiliates that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by ERISA Plans
or Other Plan Investors generally or any particular ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor, or that such an investment is
appropriate for ERISA Plans or Other Plan Investors generally or any particular ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We have entered into a purchase agreement, dated the date of this offering memorandum, with the initial
purchasers pursuant to which, and subject to the conditions therein, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers,
and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not jointly, the principal amount of the
respective series of notes set forth opposite their names below:

**Initial Purchasers** **Principal amount of notes**

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ............................................................................... $
Apollo Global Securities, LLC ..........................................................................
BMO Capital Markets Corp. ..............................................................................
BNP Paribas Securities Corp. ............................................................................
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ..................................................................
Fifth Third Securities, Inc. .................................................................................
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ..............................................................................
Mizuho Securities USA LLC .............................................................................
RBC Capital Markets, LLC................................................................................
TD Securities (USA) LLC ................................................................................

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ..............................................................................

Total ................................................................................................................... $ 1,800,000,000

The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers’ obligation to purchase the notes depends on
the satisfaction of the certain conditions contained in the purchase agreement including the obligation to purchase all
of the notes offered hereby, if any of the notes are purchased; the representations and warranties made by us to the
initial purchasers are true; there is no material change in our business or the financial markets; and we deliver
customary closing documents to the initial purchasers.

The initial purchasers will purchase the notes at the offering prices indicated on the cover of this offering
memorandum and propose initially to offer and sell the notes at the offering prices set forth on the front of this
offering memorandum. If the Escrow Conditions are satisfied or if the Merger Closing Date occurs on the closing
date of the Transactions, the initial purchasers will be entitled to receive a commission based on the gross proceeds
of this offering, which commission will only be paid to the initial purchasers if the Escrow Conditions are satisfied.
If all the notes are not sold at the initial offering price following the initial offering, the initial purchasers may
change the initial offering price and other selling terms.

**Lock-Up**

We and the guarantors have agreed not to, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of any United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any
of the Guarantors and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its debt securities, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such
offer, sale, issuance, pledge or disposition without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, on
behalf of the initial purchasers, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum.

**Indemnification**

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make for these liabilities.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in certain transactions that stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot in connection

267


-----

with the offering of the notes, creating a syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and
purchase notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the notes. Any of
these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above what it would be in the absence of such
activities. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in any of these activities, and they may end any of them
at any time. We and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that
the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial
purchasers make any representation that anyone will engage in such transactions or that such transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the following the date of pricing
of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes before the second business day prior to
the anticipated settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in
T+           , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Such purchasers should consult their own advisors.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial
purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the issuer and its affiliates, for which they
received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates are lenders under Univar’s Existing Facilities, holders of the Existing Notes and/or holders of
Univar’s common stock and therefore will receive a portion of the gross proceeds of the notes offered hereby. In
addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers
under the Credit Facilities and will receive customary compensation in connection therewith, and have, from time to
time, performed various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for us. The initial
purchasers or affiliates of the initial purchasers are acting as financial advisors to the Sponsor in connection with the
Merger and any such initial purchaser or affiliate of the initial purchasers will receive customary compensation in
connection therewith. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is
acting as Escrow Agent in connection with the Transactions and will receive customary compensation in connection
therewith. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have also made commitments to us with
respect to a secured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Merger. Amounts under the secured bridge facility will
not be funded to the extent the proceeds of the notes offered hereby are used to finance a portion of the Merger.
Apollo Global Securities, LLC is an affiliate of Apollo and will receive a portion of the gross spread as an initial
purchaser in the sale of the notes. Apollo Global Funding, LLC or one of its affiliates will also participate as an
arranger with respect to the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility for which it will receive customary fees.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer or its
affiliates. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates,
including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may also
communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express

268


-----

independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Active Market**

The notes are a new issue of securities for which there is no established public market. The Issuer does not
intend to have the notes listed on a national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system.
Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, they are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and
they may discontinue their market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, recent regulatory
actions by the SEC under Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act (and any potential regulatory developments stemming
from the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its applicable to debt securities) may restrict the ability of
brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation
medium after January 4, 2025, which may materially affect the liquidity and trading prices for the notes. Therefore,
an active or liquid market for the notes may not develop or, if developed, it may not continue. The liquidity of any
market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, the Company’s performance, the market
for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors.

**Rule 144A and Regulation S**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold within the U.S., or to or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions”. Each
series of the notes has no established trading market and will not be listed on any national securities exchange. The
initial purchasers have advised us of their intention to make a market for the notes, but have no obligation to do so
and may discontinue market-making at any time without providing any notice. We cannot assure you as to the
liquidity of any trading market for the notes.

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers proposes to resell these notes to
(a) persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and (b) outside the U.S. to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. See
“Transfer Restrictions”. Any offer or sale of the notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who
are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

Each of the initial purchasers has acknowledged and agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase
agreement, in connection with sales outside the United States, they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for
the account or benefit of U.S. persons (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after
the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes were originally issued. The initial purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom they sell the notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day distribution
compliance period, a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period referred to above, an offer or
sale of the notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule
144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**Selling Restrictions**

No action has been taken by us or the initial purchasers that would permit a public offering of the notes
offered by this offering memorandum in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The notes offered
by this offering memorandum may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this offering memorandum
or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such notes be

269


-----

distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the
applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the
distribution of this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to buy any notes offered by this offering memorandum in any jurisdiction in which such an
offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

**_European Economic Area_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**_United Kingdom_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the U.K Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K.
PRIIPS Regulation.

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial
Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated
associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA)
in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is
directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons
and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**_Canada_**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are
accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the
Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer
to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Univar Solutions Inc.

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Univar Solutions Inc. (the Company) as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes
in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any
way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures
to which it relates.

**Environmental Liabilities**

**_Description of the Matter_**

At December 31, 2022, the Company’s environmental liability balance was $90.9 million. As discussed in
Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively

F 2


-----

“environmental remediation work”) at approximately 128 locations. In determining the appropriate level of
environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors such as information obtained from investigatory
studies, scope of the remediation and related changes, the interpretation, application and enforcement of laws and
regulations, changes in the costs of remediation programs, the development of alternative cleanup technologies and
methods, and the relative level of the Company’s involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly
associated.

Auditing management’s accrual for environmental liabilities was especially challenging because it involves
judgmental underlying assumptions, including remediation methods, remediation time horizon and remediation cost
estimates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the accrual for environmental liabilities.

**_How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit_**

We tested management’s controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the
measurement and valuation of the environmental liabilities. For example, we tested controls over management’s
review of the environmental liability calculations and the significant assumptions and data inputs used by
management.

To test the accrual for environmental liabilities, we involved our specialist to assist us in evaluating the
reasonableness of the Company’s calculation and underlying assumptions. We performed audit procedures that
included, among others, assessing key methodologies and testing the significant assumptions and the underlying
data used by management. For example, we tested the site’s current remediation status and remediation strategy,
which included an analysis of the site’s remediation timeline, regulatory requirements, remediation actions and
related technologies.

**Univar Solutions Inc.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1. Nature of operations**

Headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, Univar Solutions Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading global
distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as a provider of value-added services, to
customers across a wide range of industries. The Company’s four reportable segments, defined as USA, EMEA,
Canada and LATAM, represent the geographic areas under which the Company operates and manages its business.
LATAM includes certain developing businesses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.

**2. Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of consolidation and presentation**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its majorityowned subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated if the Company has a controlling financial interest, which may
exist based on ownership of a majority of the voting interest, or based on the Company’s determination that it is the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial data presented in these consolidated financial statements are
expressed in US dollars.

Proceeds and payments under the revolving credit facilities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, which were previously reported net in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are now presented separately
to conform to the current year presentation. Additionally, certain other immaterial amounts in the prior years’
consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries participate in a multi-currency, notional cash pooling arrangement
with a third-party bank provider to manage global liquidity requirements (the “Notional Cash Pool”). Under the
Notional Cash Pool, cash deposited by participating subsidiaries is pledged as security against the overdraft balances
of other participating subsidiaries, providing legal rights of offset. As a result, the balances are presented on a net
basis within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the net cash
position of the Notional Cash Pool was $52.9 million, which consisted of a gross cash balance of $69.8 million less
a bank overdraft balance of $16.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, the net cash position of the Notional Cash Pool
was $43.2 million, which consisted of a gross cash balance of $146.0 million less a bank overdraft balance of $102.8
million.

**Trade accounts receivable, net and allowance for doubtful accounts**

Trade accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred
over the life of the trade accounts receivable. Collectability of the trade accounts receivable balance is assessed on
an ongoing basis and determined based on the delinquency of customer accounts, the financial condition of
individual customers, past collections experience and future economic expectations.

F 9


-----

Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows:

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020**

Balance as of January 1 ................................. $ 15.8 $ 17.2 $ 12.9
Provision for credit losses ......................... 5.1 6.9 9.3
Write-offs .................................................. (7.7) (8.1) (4.4)
Recoveries .................................................    -    - 0.1
Dispositions ...............................................    -    - (0.5)
Foreign exchange ...................................... (0.1) (0.2) (0.2)

Balance as of December 31 ........................... $ 13.1 $ 15.8 $ 17.2

**Inventories**

Inventories consist primarily of products purchased for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Inventory cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method and includes purchase
price from producers net of rebates received, inbound freight and handling, and direct labor and other costs incurred
to blend and repackage product, but excludes depreciation expense.

**Property, plant and equipment, net**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset as follows:

Buildings 10-50 years
Main components of tank farms 5-40 years
Containers 2-15 years
Machinery and equipment 5-20 years
Furniture, fixtures and others 5-20 years
Information technology 3-10 years

The Company evaluates the useful life and carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the
carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment loss is
recognized to the extent the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

**Goodwill and intangible assets**

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired
in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, or between annual tests if an
event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
its carrying amount. The Company’s reporting units are USA, EMEA, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

For each of the reporting units, the Company has the option to perform either the qualitative or quantitative
test. In the event a reporting unit fails the qualitative test, it is required to perform the quantitative test. The
quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting
unit’s fair value. Significant assumptions include forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”), market segment growth rates and discount rates based on a reporting unit’s weighted
average cost of capital.

If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company will recognize an
impairment for the lesser of the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value or the
reporting unit’s goodwill carrying value. As of October 1, 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment
assessment using the qualitative test and concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units.

F 10


-----

The Company’s intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized over their respective useful lives of 2
to 20 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if an event
occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.

**Short-term financing**

Short-term financing includes bank overdrafts and short-term lines of credit.

**Income taxes**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss
carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the revised
tax rate is enacted. Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive loss in the period the
underlying item expires.

The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more
likely than not that such assets will not be realized. In making such determinations, the Company considers all
available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, forecasted and
appropriate character of future taxable income, its experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not
expiring unused, tax planning strategies and the ability to carry back losses to prior years.

The Company is subject to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which is a tax on foreign income
in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company treats taxes due on future US
inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.

The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits through an assessment of whether a position is more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on its technical merits. The Company
records liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within interest expense and warehousing, selling and
administrative expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties
are included in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into US law. Effective for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2022, the IRA imposes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on share
repurchases, and creates and extends certain tax-related energy incentives. Management does not expect the taxrelated provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**Defined benefit pension plans**

The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans and recognizes actuarial gains or losses,
known as “mark to market” adjustments, as of the December 31 measurement date. The mark to market adjustments
primarily include gains and losses resulting from changes in discount rates and the difference between the expected
and actual rate of return on plan assets. Settlement gains and losses are recognized in the period in which the
settlement occurs. The fair value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of
net periodic benefit cost.

**Leases**

At the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognizes a liability to make lease payments and an
asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The Company includes options to
extend or terminate a lease within the lease term when it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. The lease
liability is measured at the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability includes
payments allocated to lease components, while payments allocated to non-lease components are expensed as

F 11


-----

incurred for all asset classes. When a contract excludes an implicit rate, the Company utilizes an incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term and geographic
region. The initial measurement of the right-of-use asset includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, fixed
lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date and initial direct costs incurred by the Company
and excludes lease incentives. Variable lease payments, such as payments based on an index rate or usage, are
expensed as incurred and excluded from lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recorded on
the consolidated balance sheets. The lease expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.

**Legal costs**

Legal costs are expensed as incurred.

**Environmental liabilities**

Environmental liabilities are recognized for probable and reasonably estimable losses associated with
environmental remediation. Incremental direct costs of the investigation, remediation effort and post-remediation
monitoring are included in the estimated environmental liabilities. The Company discounts environmental liabilities
if the liability and the respective payment streams are fixed or reliably determinable. Expected cash outflows related
to environmental remediation for the next 12 months and amounts for which the timing is uncertain are reported as
current within other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. The long-term portion of environmental
liabilities is reported within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental liabilities
are not reduced for potential insurance recoveries. Insurance recoveries are recorded when it is probable that a
recovery will be realized and are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets. Environmental remediation expenses and insurance recoveries are included within
warehousing, selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, unless associated
with disposed operations, in which case such expenses are included in other operating expenses, net.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for
transferring a good or providing a service. Since the term between invoicing and payment is less than a year,
revenue is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component. Revenue for bill-and-hold arrangements
is recognized if the Company has a substantive customer request, the materials are properly segregated and
designated as belonging to the customer, materials are ready to be transferred to the customer and the Company is
unable to direct the materials to another customer.

**_Chemical distribution_**

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied, which
generally occurs at a point in time upon completion of the shipping process as indicated by the terms of the contract.
Net sales include product sales and billings for freight and handling charges, net of discounts, expected returns,
customer price and volume incentives and sales or other revenue-based taxes. The Company estimates customer
price and volume incentives and expected customer returns based on historical experience.

**_Services_**

The Company recognizes revenue from services as they are performed and economic value is transferred to
customers. Services provided to customers are primarily related to waste management and warehousing.

F 12


-----

**_Crop sciences_**

The Company recognized revenue when control of products transferred to customers. The amount of
consideration recorded varied due to price movements and rights granted to customers to return product. Customer
payment terms often extended through a growing season, which was up to six months.

Beginning in 2021, crop sciences is no longer a revenue stream due to actions taken by the Company within
the Canada segment in 2020.

**Foreign currency**

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.
Income and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rates for
the period. The net exchange gains and losses arising from translation are reflected as a component of foreign
currency translation within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”).

Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements
of operations. Transaction gains and losses relating to intercompany borrowings that are an investment in a foreign
subsidiary are reflected as a component of foreign currency translation within AOCI.

**Stock-based compensation**

The Company measures the total amount of employee stock-based compensation expense based on the
grant date fair value of each award. Expense is recognized for each separately vesting tranche on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period, which is the shorter of the service period of the award or the period until the
employees’ retirement eligibility date. The Company recognizes forfeitures when incurred.

**Fair value**

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. The estimated fair values of those
assets and liabilities have been determined using market information and valuation methodologies. Observable
inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s
market assumptions. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value and a net asset value (“NAV”) practical expedient:

Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuation in which all significant inputs
and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant
value drivers are unobservable.

NAV As a practical expedient, certain investments are measured based on the NAV per share (or
equivalent) due to the absence of a readily available market price, and are excluded from the fair
value hierarchy.

**Derivatives**

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency and
interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. The
fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts
with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is determined by estimating

F 13


-----

the net present value of amounts to be paid under the agreement offset by the net present value of the expected cash
inflows based on market rates and associated yield curves. Based on these valuation methodologies, these derivative
contracts are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations within interest expense or other income
(expense), net. Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are recognized in the operating activities
section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded to
AOCI and are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts
designated as cash flow hedges, the Company reassesses the probability of the underlying forecasted transactions
occurring on a quarterly basis. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are
recorded to earnings in the current period.

**Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
each period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive
common share equivalents outstanding during each period. The Company reflects common share equivalents
relating to stock options, non-vested restricted stock and non-vested restricted stock units in its computation of
diluted weighted average shares outstanding, unless the effect of inclusion is anti-dilutive. The effect of dilutive
securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.

**Recently adopted accounting pronouncements**

In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2021-10 “Government Assistance” (Topic 832) - “Disclosures by Business Entities about
Government Assistance” to increase the transparency of disclosures for government assistance and grants. The ASU
requires annual disclosures pertaining to the types of received government assistance, accounting for the transactions
and the related impacts on the reported financial results. The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis
in the fourth quarter of 2022, which did not impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures as the
Company has not received significant government assistance.

In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 “Reference Rate Reform” (Topic 848) “Deferral of the
Sunset Date of Topic 848”, which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31,
2024. Topic 848 provides optional practical expedients and elections when accounting for contracts, hedging
relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of reference rates such as LIBOR, if certain
criteria are met. The standard was effective upon issuance and the Company may apply the optional practical
expedients and elections in Topic 848 prospectively through December 31, 2024. The Company adopted the
standard in the fourth quarter of 2022, which did not impact the consolidated financial statements.

**Accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted**

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 “Business Combinations” (Topic 805) - “Accounting for
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU requires an entity to recognize
and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606
(Revenue from Contracts with Customers). The standard is effective for public business entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt
this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023, which is not expected to have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 “Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs” (Subtopic
405-50) - “Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations” to enhance the transparency of disclosure regarding
supplier finance programs. The ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose information about
the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those

F 14


-----

fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023. Retrospective application of the guidance is required for all disclosures except rollforward
information, which requires prospective application. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the
standard on its disclosures.

**3. Business combinations**

The Company makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic
intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill
resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and
synergies expected to arise after the Company’s acquisition of these businesses.

**Vicom Distribución Productos Quimicos, S.L.**

On July 29, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Vicom, a leading regional
specialty chemical distributor in Spain and Portugal, for cash consideration of $14.5 million. The transaction was
accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of operations are included in the EMEA
segment. The preliminary purchase price allocation included $3.4 million in identified intangible assets related to
customer relationships and $5.6 million in goodwill, which is included in the EMEA segment and is not deductible
for income tax purposes.

**Sweetmix Distribuidora de Materias Primas Industriais Ltda**

On December 1, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Sweetmix, a food
ingredients and CASE specialty chemical distribution company in Brazil. The purchase price, including
measurement period adjustments, was $53.0 million, $28.7 million of which was paid in cash (net of cash acquired
of $1.2 million) upon closing, with the remaining $23.1 million to be paid over the next five years. The transaction
was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of operations are included in the
LATAM segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company updated the purchase price allocation to reflect
intangible asset fair value adjustments, purchase price adjustments and the deferred tax impacts of the recognized
adjustments. The final purchase price allocation and measurement period adjustments are presented in the table
below:

**Zhuhai Techi Chem Silicone Industry Corporation**

On December 18, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the specialty silicone solutions business
of Techi Chem, a leading distributor of specialty silicone solutions used primarily for the CASE market within the
China marketplace. The purchase price of $6.8 million was comprised of $4.6 million paid in cash and $2.2 million
of contingent consideration. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the
results of operations are included in the LATAM segment.

**4. Dispositions**

The dispositions below did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements since the dispositions did not represent a strategic shift that had, or
will have, a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.

**Distrupol Business**

On April 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Distrupol business within the EMEA segment for
total cash proceeds of $136.7 million. In 2021, the Company recorded an $87.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of
business in the consolidated statements of operations, net of a release of cumulative foreign currency translation
losses of $18.1 million. The sale of the Distrupol business was exempt from tax under local country subsidiary
participation exemptions. The impact of the sale on US income taxes was minimal. The Company recorded income
before income taxes attributable to the Distrupol business of $3.9 million and $10.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**Canadian Agriculture Services Business**

On November 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its Canadian Agriculture services business
within the Canada segment for total net cash proceeds of $39.3 million after closing transaction-related expenses. In
2020, the Company recorded a $31.5 million pre-tax loss on sale of business in the consolidated statements of
operations. In 2021, the Company recognized a favorable adjustment of $0.7 million, decreasing the loss on sale
recorded in 2020. The Company recorded income before income taxes attributable to the Canadian Agriculture
services business of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Industrial Spill and Emergency Response Businesses**

On September 1, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its industrial spill and emergency response
businesses to EnviroServe Inc. for total net cash proceeds of $6.2 million after closing transaction-related expenses.
In 2020, the Company recorded a $10.5 million pre-tax loss on sale of business in the consolidated statements of
operations. The Company recorded a loss before income taxes attributable to these businesses of $26.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Environmental Sciences Business**

On December 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Environmental Sciences business to AEA
Investors LP for total net cash proceeds of $174.0 million plus a $5.0 million ($2.4 million present value)
subordinated note receivable. In 2020, the Company recorded a net working capital adjustment of $8.2 million,
reducing the proceeds and the gain on sale initially recorded in 2019.

**5. Impairment charges**

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant estimates include forecasted EBITDA,
working capital, capital expenditures and discount rates. As the inputs for testing recoverability and determining fair
value of the asset groups are largely based on management’s judgments and are not generally observable in active
markets, the Company considers such inputs to be Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.

**Year ended December 31, 2021**

Throughout 2021, the Company announced the closure of certain operating facilities in the USA and
Canada segments, which resulted in impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment, net of $3.0 million
within the consolidated statements of operations.

**Year ended December 31, 2020**

During 2020, the Company determined there was a more likely than not expectation that the industrial spill
and emergency response businesses within the USA segment would be sold. The Company determined this to be an
impairment triggering event, requiring the assessment of the recoverability of these long-lived asset groups. The
Company tested the recoverability and determined the assets to be impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a
non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $15.5 million, consisting of $12.8 million of intangible assets, net and $2.7
million of property, plant and equipment, net, within the consolidated statements of operations.

During 2020, the Company decided to cease further investment in, and seek to exit a contract related to
certain technology assets, consisting of capitalized software and hardware components. This event represented an
impairment triggering event requiring an impairment analysis within the Other segment. As a result, the Company
recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $21.7 million, inclusive of non-cash and cash components of $19.7 million
and $2.0 million, respectively, relating to property, plant and equipment, net, within the consolidated statements of
operations.

Additionally, the Company recorded impairment charges of $3.0 million related to property, plant and
equipment, net within the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. The
impairment charges were in connection with the announced closure of certain operating facilities in the USA
segment and the wind down of the Canadian Agriculture wholesale distribution business.

**7. Revenue**

The Company disaggregates revenues from contracts with customers by both geographic reportable
segments and revenue contract types. Geographic reportable segmentation is pertinent to understanding the
Company’s revenues, as it aligns with how the Company reviews the financial performance of its operations.
Revenue contract types are differentiated by the type of good or service the Company offers customers, since the
contractual terms necessary for revenue recognition are unique to each of the identified revenue contract types.

**Senior Term Loan Facilities**

In 2019, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to its Credit Agreement dated July 1, 2015
(“Credit Agreement”), which provided a Term B-5 Loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $400
million that matures on July 1, 2026 (“Term B-5 Loan”). The Term B-5 Loan is payable in quarterly installments of
0.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount. The interest rate applicable to the Term B-5 Loan is based on, at the
Company’s option, (i) a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to a base rate plus an applicable margin
of 1.00% or (ii) a Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. The Company can prepay the Term B-5
Loan in whole or part without penalty.

In 2020, using the proceeds from the sale of the Environmental Sciences business, the Company repaid
$174.0 million of previously incurred term loan debt.

In 2021, to secure favorable interest rates and extend principal maturities, the Company entered into the
Sixth Amendment to its Credit Agreement, which provided a Term B-6 Loan facility in an aggregate initial principal
amount of $1.0 billion that matures on June 3, 2028 (“Term B-6 Loan”). The proceeds from the Term B-6 Loan and
an incremental borrowing of $274.2 million under the North American ABL Facility were used to repay in full
previously incurred term loan debt and satisfy related lending and refinancing fees. As a result of the issuance of the
Term B-6 Loan and the repayment of the Term B-3 Loan, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt
of $2.0 million and debt refinancing costs of $6.9 million during the second quarter of 2021, both of which are
included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Term B-6 Loan is payable in quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate initial principal amount
beginning in September 2021. The interest rate applicable to the Term B-6 Loan is based on, at the Company’s
option, (i) a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to a base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.00% or
(ii) a Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin of 2.00% (in each case with a 0.25% step down based on the
achievement of a specific leverage level). The Company can prepay the Term B-6 Loan in whole or part without
penalty.

**ABL Facilities**

On October 27, 2022, the Company and certain of its US, Canadian and European subsidiaries entered into
the Second Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (the “Senior ABL Facility”). The Senior ABL Facility
amends and restates in full the amended and restated ABL facility entered into by the Company on February 28,
2019 (“North American ABL Facility”). In connection with the entry into the Senior ABL Facility, the Company
terminated its existing European ABL Credit Agreement and the Euro ABL Facility thereunder. The Senior ABL
Facility, which matures on October 27, 2027, provides a five-year senior secured ABL credit facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $1.6 billion (“Senior ABL Credit Facility”) and a five-year senior secured term loan facility in
an aggregate principal amount of $200 million (“Senior ABL Term Loan”). Borrowing availability is determined by
a borrowing base consisting of eligible inventory, eligible accounts receivable and cash of the Company and certain
of its subsidiaries. The Senior ABL Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments of 12.5% of the aggregate initial
principal amount beginning in March 2026.

The interest rates applicable to the Senior ABL Facility will be based on, at the Company’s option, (i) with
respect to the Senior ABL Term Loan, a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either a base rate plus
an applicable margin of 0.75% or a term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75%, in each case with one
0.25% step down based on achievement of a specific leverage level and (ii) with respect to the Senior ABL Credit
Facility, a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.125%,
0.25% or 0.375% or a term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.125%, 1.25% or 1.375%, with the margin in
each case based on average combined testing availability. The applicable margin will be adjusted after the
completion of each full fiscal quarter based upon the pricing grid in the Senior ABL Facility. The Senior ABL
Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default.

During 2021, the Company made a series of prepayments on the Canadian ABL term loan using the
proceeds from the sale of the Canadian Agriculture services business and cash on hand, which resulted in the full
extinguishment of the loan.

**Senior Unsecured Notes**

In 2019, the Company issued $500.0 million in Senior Unsecured Notes due December 1, 2027 (“2027
Senior Notes”), with a fixed interest rate of 5.125%. The Company can prepay the 2027 Senior Notes in whole or
part at a premium on or after December 1, 2022 and without a premium on or after December 1, 2024. The
Company repurchased $46.0 million of the 2027 Senior Notes in the open market during the second quarter of 2022,
resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million within other income (expense), net in the consolidated
statements of operations.

$1.5 million and losses of $2.3 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The Company recognized no debt refinancing costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and

€200 million Euro ABL Facility ................................................................. N/A 0.375%

The Senior ABL Facility is secured by a first priority lien on the loan parties’ accounts receivable,
inventory and cash as well as a second priority lien on substantially all other assets of the US subsidiary loan parties
and other assets of certain European subsidiary loan parties in each case subject to various limitations and
exceptions. In addition, 65% of the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries have been pledged as security. The Senior
Term Loan Facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the US operating and management subsidiaries
and a second priority lien on such accounts receivable and inventory. The Company had assets pledged of
approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

**Debt covenants**

The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. The Senior ABL Facility includes a springing fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.0x, applicable only if availability is less than or equal to 10% of the borrowing capacity.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had availability in excess of the minimum borrowing capacity and therefore
this financial covenant is not applicable.

**Other information**

The fair values of debt were based on current market quotes for similar borrowings and credit risk adjusted
for liquidity, margins and amortization, as necessary, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The Company is exposed to credit loss and loss of liquidity availability if the financial institutions or
counterparties issuing the debt securities fail to perform. The Company minimizes exposure to these credit risks by
dealing with a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. The Company manages credit risk by
monitoring the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of its lending counterparties, and does not
anticipate counterparty non-performance.

**12. Employee benefit plans**

**Defined benefit pension plans**

The Company sponsors defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits for employees upon retirement
in certain jurisdictions including the US, Canada, United Kingdom and several other European countries. The US,
Canada and United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants.

**_United Kingdom buy-in contract_**

Continuing the Company’s efforts to reduce retirement plan risk while delivering promised benefits to plan
participants, the Trustees of the Univar Pension Scheme (1978) (“the UK Plan”) executed a buy-in contract in
December 2021. The buy-in arrangement is an insurance contract providing substantially all future benefit plan
payments to all UK Plan participants. As such, this transaction significantly mitigates volatility by removing
investment, longevity, interest rate and inflation risk. However, the primary benefit obligation remains with the
Company.

The buy-in contract remains an asset of the UK Plan and is part of the plan’s investment strategy. The UK
Plan transferred substantially all of the Company’s UK pension plan assets to the insurer in exchange for an
insurance contract at the effective date of the buy-in. The buy-in contract had a fair value of $241.5 million as of
December 31, 2022 and is classified as a Level 3 investment. The projected benefit obligation of the UK Plan as of
December 31, 2022 was $198.3 million, which was net of $19.4 million of prior service credits recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss.

**_US pension settlement_**

In November 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase an
irrevocable group annuity contract. The Company transferred US qualified pension plan liabilities of $72.6 million
and plan assets of $67.7 million, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax settlement gain of $4.9 million.

The Company expects to continue to consider future opportunities to prudently manage costs and risks of
its global retirement plans. Future transactions could result in non-cash settlement or mark to market charges which
may impact earnings and could be material to a given reporting period.

Expected annual rate of compensation increase ........... N/A N/A N/A 1.87% 2.91% 2.85%

Discount rates are used to measure benefit obligations and the interest cost component of net periodic
benefit cost (income). The Company selects its discount rates based on the consideration of equivalent yields on
high-quality fixed income investments at each measurement date. Discount rates are based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represent the rates at which the Company’s benefit obligations could effectively be settled as
of the measurement date.

For domestic defined benefit plans, the discount rates are based on a hypothetical bond portfolio approach.
The hypothetical bond portfolio is constructed to comprise AA-rated corporate bonds whose cash flow from
coupons and maturities match the expected future plan benefit payments.

The discount rates for the foreign defined benefit plans are based on a yield curve approach. For plans in
countries with a sufficient corporate bond market, the expected future benefit payments are matched with a yield
curve derived from AA-rated corporate bonds, subject to minimum amounts outstanding and meeting other selection
criteria. For plans in countries without a sufficient corporate bond market, the yield curve is constructed based on
prevailing government yields and an estimated credit spread to reflect a corporate risk premium. The discount rate to
value UK Plan liabilities continues to be set with reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations on long-term
average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the benefit obligations. The long-term
rate of return assumptions are based on the outlook for equity and fixed income returns, with consideration of
historical returns, asset allocations, investment strategies and premiums for active management when appropriate.
Assumptions reflect the expected rates of return at the beginning of the year.

**_Plan asset management_**

Plan assets for defined benefit plans are invested in global equity, debt securities or insurance contracts
through professional investment managers with the objective to achieve targeted risk adjusted returns and to
maintain liquidity sufficient to fund current benefit payments. Each funded defined benefit plan has an investment
policy that is administered by plan trustees with the objective of meeting targeted asset allocations based on the
circumstances of that particular plan.

The investment strategy followed by the Company varies by country depending on the circumstances of the
underlying plan. Less mature plan benefit obligations are funded by using more equity securities as they are
expected to achieve long-term growth while exceeding inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded
using a higher allocation of fixed income securities as they are expected to produce current income with limited
volatility.

The Company has adopted a dynamic investment strategy whereby as the plan funded status improves, the
investment strategy is migrated to more liability matching assets, and return seeking assets are reduced. Risk
management practices include the use of multiple asset classes for diversification purposes. Specific guidelines for
each asset class and investment manager are implemented and monitored. As noted above, substantially all of the
UK Plan assets were within a buy-in contract as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, subsequent to the transaction
executed in December 2021.

**_Plan asset valuation methodologies_**

**Plan asset** **Description of methodology**

Cash ................................................ This represents cash at banks at fair value, reflected within Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy.
Investment funds ............................ Fair values are based on the NAV of the units held at year end. The NAVs
are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the funds, less their
liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding at the valuation date.
The funds are traded on private markets that are not active, with unit prices
based on observable (Level 2) or unobservable (Level 3) market data based
on the fund’s underlying assets.
Buy-in contract ............................... This represents the UK Plan buy-in contract assets. Fair values are based on
initial pricing adjusted for changes in government and corporate bond
yields, inflation, demographic assumptions and changes in participant data,
and as such are considered Level 3 based on the significant unobservable
inputs used in deriving the assets’ fair values.
Insurance contracts ......................... Fair values are based on the present value of the accrued benefit, and as
such are considered Level 3 based on the significant unobservable inputs
used in deriving the asset’s fair values.
Investments measured at NAV ....... Investment in a real estate fund, which invests in real estate assets. The
investment in properties by the real estate fund is carried at fair value,
which is estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset
in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the
measurement date. The investment can be withdrawn quarterly, after a one
hundred days notice period.

The Company provides defined contribution plans and had contribution expense of $52.9 million, $51.4
million and $43.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**Multi-employer pension plans**

The Company contributes to certain multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from
collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from singleemployer plans in the following aspects:

    - Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by the Company may be used to provide benefits to
employees of other participating employers.

    - If the Company stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by
the remaining participating employers. Similarly, the Company could be liable for underfunded
obligations of other, departed employers.

    - If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, it may be required to
pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal
liability. A withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the
liability can be reasonably estimated.

The Company’s participation in these plans for the annual period ended December 31, 2022 is outlined in
the table below. The Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) zone status is the most recently available and is certified by the
plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the “red zone” are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the “yellow
zone” are less than 80 percent funded and plans in the “green zone” are at least 80 percent funded. The “FIP/RP
status pending/implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or a
rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan contributions, the
Company may be subject to a surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The “Surcharge imposed” column indicates
whether a surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the
collective bargaining agreement(s) (“CBA”) to which the plans are subject. Contributions may be required in future
periods by the CBAs, statutory obligations or other contractual obligations.

If the Company were to cease making contributions to these plans at one or more or all locations, it could
trigger a withdrawal liability that could be material to the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.
Calculating any such withdrawal liability depends on a number of factors that are out of the Company’s control and
subject to change. A withdrawal liability represents an employer’s proportional share of the multi-employer plan’s
unfunded vested benefits (“UVBs”). UVBs equal the value of non-forfeitable benefits owed by the plan, less the
value of the plan’s assets. The value of assets and liabilities are determined using actuarial assumptions that reflect
the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated UVBs for that employer.

-----

A significant portion of the Company’s exposure historically resided with the eight facilities that
participated in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (“Central States Pension Fund”).
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized its best estimate of a withdrawal liability of
$31.2 million related to triggering events at all eight sites, culminating in the Company ceasing to participate in the
Central States Pension Fund. Upon an agreed final funding assessment with the Central States Pension Fund, the
Company will recognize any differences between the estimated and actual withdrawal liability. As of December 31,
2022, this balance is unchanged. The Company estimates its cash obligation to be approximately $1.9 million
annually for each of the next 20 years. The net present value of the withdrawal liability was determined using a riskfree interest rate. Amounts associated with the withdrawal liability are included in other operating expenses, net in
the consolidated statements of operations and other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred tax liabilities ............................................................................................. (249.2) (228.7)

Net deferred tax liability .......................................................................................... $ (85.5) $ (26.7)

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $17.6 million (tax effected) of NOLs, of which $0.7 million
will expire in the period 2023 through 2027, $3.8 million will expire in the period between 2028 and 2041 and the
remaining $13.1 million has no expiration. Additionally, the Company has approximately $4.9 million of foreign tax
credits and capital loss carryforwards. The Company does not expect future earnings of the appropriate character of
taxable income to allow it to utilize certain of these tax attributes in future years. Therefore, the Company maintains
a valuation allowance of $12.7 million on these tax attributes and other deferred tax assets.

**Foreign Tax Effects**

The Company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the US. As of December 31,
2022, the Company is indefinitely reinvested with respect to its US directly-owned subsidiary earnings. Therefore,
the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. The Company is
subject to US income tax on substantially all foreign earnings under the GILTI provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, while a significant portion of remaining foreign earnings are eligible for the dividends received deduction.
As a result, a portion of any future repatriation of $628.8 million of undistributed earnings may be subject to US
income tax, as well as state and local income taxes, withholding taxes and currency translation gains or losses. It is
impracticable to calculate the exact amount. Additionally, gains and losses on any future taxable dispositions of USowned foreign affiliates continue to be subject to US income tax.

**Unrecognized Tax Benefits**

The changes in unrecognized tax benefits included in other long-term liabilities, excluding interest and
penalties, were as follows:

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020**

Balance as of January 1 ....................................................................... $ 40.1 $ 35.0 $ 1.1
Increase for tax positions of current year ........................................ — 19.4 16.4
Increase for tax positions of prior years .......................................... 0.4 0.9 17.8
Decrease for tax positions of prior years ......................................... — (14.4) —
Reductions due to the statute of limitations expiration ................... (0.1) (0.7) (0.3)
Reductions due to settlement with taxing authorities ...................... (0.3) — —
Foreign exchange ............................................................................ — (0.1) —

Balance as of December 31 ................................................................. $ 40.1 $ 40.1 $ 35.0

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $40.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if
recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate. The Company files income tax returns in the US and various
state and foreign jurisdictions. Generally, tax years are open for review by taxing authorities for a period of three
years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has limited audit activity for tax years back to 2008 through 2010, as
well as for the periods 2012 through 2020. The Company continues to believe its positions are supportable;
however, due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, the Company’s estimates of the ultimate settlement of
uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ from the estimates.

F 34

The Company recognized $2.4 million, $0.1 million and $0.6 million of interest and/or penalties related to
income tax matters in interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had $4.3 million and
$2.0 million of interest and penalties reflected within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**14. Share repurchase program and stock-based compensation**

**Share repurchase program**

On November 1, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share
repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock, which expires on October 27, 2026.
On November 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the amount
of authorized repurchases under the program of $1.0 billion, resulting in a total authorized repurchase amount of
$1.5 billion. The program does not require the repurchase of any minimum number of shares and can be suspended,
modified or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. Under the share repurchase program, the
Company may purchase shares from time to time at the discretion of management through open market purchases,
privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs, or other
means.

On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into an ASR with Goldman to repurchase $200.0 million of
its common stock. On November 3, 2022, the Company paid $200.0 million to Goldman and received an initial
delivery of approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock, which represented 75% of the notional value of
the ASR divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 1, 2022. The final number of
shares repurchased under the ASR was based on the daily volume-weighted average prices for Rule 10b-18 eligible
transactions in the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR, less a discount and subject to adjustment
pursuant to the terms of the ASR. In February 2023, the final settlement was determined to be an additional delivery
of approximately 0.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock from Goldman.

As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate purchase price of the ASR was recorded as a reduction to
stockholders’ equity, consisting of a $150.0 million increase in treasury stock to reflect the value of the initial share
delivery and a $50.0 million decrease in additional paid-in capital pending final settlement of the ASR. The amount
recorded in additional paid-in capital will be reclassified to treasury stock in the first quarter of 2023 in connection
with the final settlement of the ASR.

In addition to the ASR, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 7.7 million shares for
$209.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 1.8 million shares for $50.0 million
during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s remaining stock repurchase authorization under the
program was approximately $1,040.9 million as of December 31, 2022.

**Stock-based compensation**

In May 2020, the Company replaced the Univar Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017
Plan”) with the Univar Solutions Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2017 Plan had no further
awards granted and any available reserves under the 2017 Plan were terminated and not transferred to the 2020 Plan.
There were no changes to the outstanding awards related to the 2017 Plan, the Univar Inc. 2015 Stock Incentive Plan
and Univar Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (together with the 2017 Plan and the 2020 Plan, the “Plans”).

The 2020 Plan allows the Company to issue awards to employees, consultants and directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Awards may be made in the form of stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents,
deferred share units or other stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2022, there were 8.6 million shares authorized
under the Plans. The Company generally issues authorized but previously unissued shares to satisfy stock option
exercises and stock award vestings.

F 35


-----

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized total stock-based
compensation expense within other operating expenses, net of $34.3 million, $25.4 million and $14.5 million, and a
net tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million,
respectively.

**_Stock options_**

Stock options expire ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a three-year
period or less, based on continued employment, with annual vesting. The exercise price of a stock option is
determined based upon the fair value of the common stock at the time of each grant. Participants have no
stockholder rights until the time of exercise.

The following table reflects stock option activity under the Plans:

**Weighted-average**

**remaining** **Aggregate**

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
non-vested stock options of approximately $0.1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
0.1 years.

**Year ended December 31,**

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020**

Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised....................................... $ 7.8 $ 2.3 $ 0.3

**_Restricted stock_**

Non-vested restricted stock relates to awards for members of the Company’s Board of Directors which vest
over 12 months. The grant date fair value of restricted stock is based on the market price of the common stock on
that date. Non-vested shares of restricted stock may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture until
vesting. Both vested and non-vested shares of restricted stock are included in the Company’s shares outstanding.

The following table reflects restricted stock activity under the Plans:

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
non-vested restricted stock awards of approximately $0.2 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 0.3 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of granted restricted stock was $24.29 and $13.91 in
2021 and 2020, respectively.

**_Restricted stock units (“RSUs”)_**

RSUs awarded to employees generally vest in three equal annual installments, subject to continued
employment. Each RSU converts into one share of Univar Solutions common stock on the applicable vesting date.
RSUs may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred until they vest and are subject to forfeiture. The grant date
fair value is based on the market price of Univar Solutions stock on that date.

The following table reflects RSU activity under the Plans:

**Number of Restricted** **Weighted-average**

**Stock Units** **grant date fair value**

Non-vested at January 1, 2022 ................................................................ 1,553,491 $ 21.61

Forfeited .............................................................................................. (118,560) 23.04
Non-vested at December 31, 2022 .......................................................... 1,456,402 $ 25.18


As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
non-vested RSU awards of approximately $12.8 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 1.0 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of granted RSU awards was $21.66 and $21.29 in 2021 and
2020, respectively.

**_Performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”)_**

The Company awards performance-based shares to certain employees. These awards vest upon the passage
of time and the achievement of performance conditions, which is generally over a three year period. The Company
reviews progress toward the attainment of the performance conditions each quarter during the vesting period. When
it is probable the minimum performance conditions for the award will be achieved, the Company begins recognizing
the expense equal to the proportionate share of the total fair value. The total expense recognized over the duration of
performance awards will equal the grant date fair value multiplied by the number of shares ultimately awarded based
on the level of attainment of the performance conditions.

For grants with market conditions, the fair value is determined on the grant date by using a Monte Carlo
simulation model, with a duration of three years. The PRSUs awarded may be subject to a downward or upward
adjustment depending on the total stockholder return achieved by the Company during the particular performance
period relative to the total stockholder return ranking among peer companies as specified in the respective PRSU
award agreement. The total expense recognized over the duration of the award is not adjusted based on the level of
attainment of the market conditions.

The following table reflects PRSU activity under the Plans:

**Number of Performance-**

**Units** **grant date fair value**

Non-vested at January 1, 2022 ............................................................ 709,260 $ 21.77

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
non-vested PRSU awards of approximately $7.7 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 1.5 years.

**_Fair value_**

**Year ended**

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020**

Fair value of restricted stock, RSUs and

PRSUs vested ............................................. $ 40.1 $ 9.6 $ 9.2

**_Employee stock purchase plan_**

The Univar Solutions Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, authorizing the issuance of up to 2.0
million shares of the Company’s common stock allows qualified participants to purchase the Company’s common
stock at 95% of its market price during the last day of two offering periods in each calendar year. The first offering
period is January through June, and the second from July through December. As of December 31, 2022, the total
number of shares issued under the plan for the two offering periods in 2022 was 60,942 shares.

**_Stock-based compensation fair value assumptions_**

The fair value of the Company’s stock that is factored into the fair value of stock options and utilized for
restricted stock, RSUs and PRSUs with internally developed performance conditions is based on the grant date
closing price on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair value of PRSUs with market conditions.
The weighted average grant date fair value of PRSUs with market conditions was $27.94 and $20.36 for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average assumptions under the Monte Carlo
simulation model were as follows:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2022** **2021**

Risk-free interest rate[(1)] .................................................................................... 1.6% 0.3%
Expected dividend yield ................................................................................... — —
Expected volatility[(2)] ......................................................................................... 51.7% 53.8%

(1) The risk-free interest rate was based on the US Treasury yield for a period in years equal to the remaining

performance period from date of grant.

(2) The expected volatility for each grant was determined based on the historical weekly stock price returns of the

Company’s common stock over a period equal to the remaining term of the performance period from the date of
grant.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock
options granted. No stock options were granted in 2021 or 2022. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock
options was $6.17 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The weighted-average assumptions used under the BlackScholes-Merton option valuation model were as follows:

F 38


-----

**Year ended December 31,**

**2020**

Risk-free interest rate[(1)] ...................................................................................... 1.4%
Expected dividend yield ..................................................................................... —
Expected volatility[(2)] ........................................................................................... 24.4%
Expected term (years)[(3)] ...................................................................................... 6.0

(1) The risk-free interest rate was based on the US Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected term of

the stock options at the time of grant.

(2) As the Company did not have sufficient historical volatility data, the expected volatility was based on the

average historical data of a peer group of public companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock
options.

(3) As the Company did not have sufficient historical exercise data under the Plans, the expected term was based on

the average of the vesting period of each tranche and the original contract term of 10 years.

**15. Fair value measurements**

The Company classifies its financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy described in “Note 2:
Significant accounting policies.”

**Items measured at fair value on a recurring basis**

The following table is a reconciliation of recurring fair value measurements that use significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consisted of the warrant liability related to the Nexeo acquisition and Techi
Chem acquisition contingent consideration liabilities:

**Warrant Liability** **Contingent Consideration**

**(in millions)** **2021** **2020** **2021** **2020**

Fair value as of January 1 .................................... $ 33.8 $ 33.0 $ 2.2 $ —
Additions ......................................................... — — — 2.2
Fair value adjustments ..................................... (33.8) 0.8 — —
Foreign exchange ............................................ — — 0.1 —
Transfers out of Level 3 .................................. — — (2.3) —

Fair value as of December 31 .............................. $ — $ 33.8 $ — $ 2.2

In conjunction with the Nexeo acquisition in 2019, the Company assumed warrants that were converted
into the right to receive, upon exercise, approximately 7.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock. During
2021, a portion of the outstanding warrants were exercised at a price of $27.80, resulting in the issuance of 973,717
shares of common stock and the receipt of $27.1 million in cash proceeds. All remaining warrants expired on June 9,
2021, resulting in the write-off of the warrants’ fair value within other income (expense), net in the consolidated
statements of operations.

As the performance period for the Techi Chem contingent consideration ended in 2021, and inputs to the
liability were no longer unobservable, the Company no longer considered the balance a Level 3 classification.

**16. Derivatives**

**Foreign currency derivatives**

The Company uses forward currency contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange rates
relating to certain of the Company’s intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies. These derivative instruments are not formally designated as cash flow hedges by the Company and the
terms of these instruments range from one to three months.

**Interest rate swap contracts**

The objective of the Company’s designated interest rate swap contracts is to offset the variability of cash
flows in LIBOR and SOFR indexed debt interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rates
related to the Term B-6 Loan (previously the Term B-3 Loan) and a portion of debt outstanding under the Senior
ABL Facility (previously the North American ABL Facility).

In June 2021, the Company executed two interest rate swap contracts, both effective June 30, 2023, to
replace existing interest rate swap contracts with maturities occurring between June 2023 and June 2024. These
interest rate swap contracts contain an initial aggregate notional value of $250.0 million from June 2023 to June
2024 that increases to an aggregate notional value of $500.0 million from June 2024 to May 2028.

The Company also uses undesignated interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate variability.

**Cross currency swap contracts**

Cross currency swap contracts are used to effectively convert the Term B-5 Loan’s principal amount of
floating rate US dollar denominated debt, including interest payments, to fixed-rate Euro denominated debt. The
cross currency swap contracts mature in November 2024 and approximately 95% of the contracts are designated as a
cash flow hedge.

The Company also uses undesignated cross currency swap contracts to manage interest rate variability and
mitigate foreign exchange exposure.

**Notional amounts and fair value of derivative instruments**

**18. Commitments and contingencies**

**Litigation**

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to pending or threatened claims, lawsuits,
regulatory matters and administrative proceedings from time to time. Where appropriate the Company has recorded
provisions in the consolidated financial statements for these matters. The liabilities for injuries to persons or
property are in some instances covered by liability insurance, subject to various deductibles and self-insured
retentions.

Other than as disclosed, the Company is not aware of any claims, lawsuits, regulatory matters or
administrative proceedings, pending or threatened, that are likely to have a material effect on its overall financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any present or
future claims or litigation or the potential for future claims or litigation and adverse developments could negatively
impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period.

**_Asbestos Claims_**

The Company is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. The
claims result primarily from an indemnification obligation related to Univar Solutions USA Inc.’s (“Univar”) 1986
purchase of McKesson Chemical Company from McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”). Univar is pursuing
insurance coverage for certain matters under McKesson’s historical insurance coverage to partially offset the impact
of any fees, settlements, or judgments that Univar is obligated to pay because of its obligation to McKesson. As of
December 31, 2022, there were approximately 232 asbestos-related cases for which Univar has the obligation to
defend and indemnify; however, this number tends to fluctuate up and down over time. Historically, the vast
majority of these asbestos cases have been dismissed without payment or with a nominal payment. While the
Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts,
that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material effect on its overall financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

**_Unclaimed Property Audit_**

The Company and its subsidiaries were the subject of an unclaimed property audit request issued by the
State of Delaware in 2015. On June 29, 2022, the State of Delaware notified the Company that it was closing its

F 43


-----

examination with a $0 finding. On September 13, 2022, the parties executed a confidential settlement agreement and
release.

**_Canada Revenue Agency_**

In October 2022, the Company received notice from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) proposing that
certain historical financing transactions between one of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries (Univar Canada Ltd.)
and one of the Company’s US subsidiaries (Univar Holdco Canada LLC) should be recharacterized as equity and
not debt for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The CRA has proposed that certain deductions claimed by the Canadian
entity should be denied, resulting in additional tax due, as well as penalties and interest on the unpaid tax. The
proposed assessment against the Company, inclusive of interest and penalties of Canadian Dollar (“C$”) 22.0
million, totals C$51.0 million.

It is possible that the CRA might take a similar position in relation to two additional tax years (2017 and
2018), but the Company has not received a proposal in relation to those years. The transactions that are being
challenged by the CRA for 2015 and 2016 do not apply in periods after 2018.

The Company believes that the tax position previously taken was proper and it will defend itself as
appropriate. The Company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for this matter, as
it believes it is more likely than not that the Company’s position will be sustained.

**Environmental**

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require
environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively “environmental remediation work”) and from time to
time the Company becomes aware of compliance matters regarding possible or alleged violations of these laws or
regulations. For example, over the years, the Company has been identified as a “potentially responsible party”
(“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and/or similar state
laws that impose liability for costs relating to environmental remediation work at various sites. As a PRP, the
Company may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of certain sites. The Company is
currently engaged in environmental remediation work at approximately 128 locations, some that are now or were
previously Company-owned/occupied and some that were never Company-owned/occupied (“non-owned sites”).

The Company’s environmental remediation work at some sites is being conducted pursuant to
governmental proceedings or investigations. At other sites, the Company, with appropriate state or federal agency
oversight and approval, is conducting the environmental remediation work voluntarily. The Company is currently
undergoing remediation efforts or is in the process of active review of the need for potential remediation efforts at
approximately 107 current or formerly Company-owned/occupied sites. In addition, the Company may be liable as a
PRP for a share of the clean-up of approximately 21 non-owned sites. These non-owned sites are typically (a)
locations of independent waste disposal or recycling operations with alleged or confirmed contaminated soil and/or
groundwater to which the Company may have shipped waste products or drums for re-conditioning, or (b)
contaminated non-owned sites near historical sites owned or operated by the Company or its predecessors from
which contamination is alleged to have arisen.

In determining the appropriate level of environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors
such as information obtained from investigatory studies; the scope of remediation (including any changes over
time); the interpretation, application and enforcement of laws and regulations; changes in the costs of remediation
programs; the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; and the relative level of the Company’s
involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. The level of annual expenditures for
remedial, monitoring and investigatory activities will change in the future as major components of planned
remediation activities are completed and the scope, timing and costs of existing activities are changed. Project lives,
and therefore cash flows, may range from 2 to 30 years, depending on the specific site and type of remediation
project.

F 44


-----

Although the Company believes that its accruals are adequate for environmental contingencies, it is
possible, due to the uncertainties noted above, that additional accruals could be required in the future that could have
a material effect on the overall financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

Changes in total environmental liabilities, which were measured on an undiscounted basis, were as follows:

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021**

Environmental liabilities as of January 1............................................................ $ 88.1 $ 79.6
Revised obligation estimates .......................................................................... 25.9 29.0

Current environmental liabilities Other accrued expenses $ 36.5 $ 39.3
Long-term environmental liabilities Other long-term liabilities 54.4 48.8

As of December 31, 2022, receivables for insurance recoveries of $6.7 million and $9.3 million were
recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance
sheets. No receivables for insurance recoveries were recorded as of December 31, 2021. Insurance recoveries of
$16.7 million were recorded within warehousing, selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Company manages estimated cash flows by project. These estimates are subject to change if there are
modifications to the scope of the remediation plan or if other factors, either external or internal, change the timing of
the remediation activities. The Company periodically reviews the status of all existing or potential environmental
liabilities and adjusts its accruals based on all available, relevant information. Based on current estimates, the
expected payments for environmental remediation for the next five years and thereafter at December 31, 2022 were
as follows:

**(in millions)**
2023 ...................................................................................................................................... $ 36.5
2024 ...................................................................................................................................... 12.4
2025 ...................................................................................................................................... 6.9

2027 ...................................................................................................................................... 4.5
Thereafter ............................................................................................................................. 25.3

Total ..................................................................................................................................... $ 90.9

**19. Leasing**

The Company leases certain warehouses and distribution centers, office space, transportation equipment
and other machinery and equipment. The majority of the leases have remaining terms of 1 to 8 years. The lease
agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company
subleases certain facilities to third parties.

**Sale-leaseback transaction**

During 2020, the Company recognized a net gain of $14.4 million associated with a sale-leaseback
agreement related to a real estate property. The Company intends to lease the property for a period of 15 years and
has classified the agreement as an operating lease.

**20. Segments**

The Company’s operations are structured into four reportable segments that represent the geographic areas
under which it operates and manages the business. Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker,
monitors the operating results of its reportable segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about
resource allocation and performance assessment. Management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments
on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of consolidated net income;
depreciation; amortization; net interest expense; income tax expense; impairment charges; (gain) loss on sale of
business; other operating expenses, net and other income (expense), net (for both, see “Note 8: Supplemental
financial information”). For 2020, Adjusted EBITDA also included an adjustment to remove a Brazil VAT charge.

Transfer prices between reportable segments are set on an arms-length basis in a similar manner to
transactions with third parties. Corporate operating expenses that directly benefit segments have been allocated to
the reportable segments. Allocable operating expenses are identified through a review process by management. The
allocable operating expenses are assigned to the reportable segments on a basis that reasonably approximates the use
of services, which is generally measured based on a weighted distribution of margin, asset, headcount or time spent.

Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows:

**Business line information**

The Company’s net sales from external customers primarily relate to its chemical distribution business.
Other sales to external customers primarily relate to services for collecting and arranging for the transportation of
hazardous and non-hazardous waste.

**Risks and Concentrations**

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in any of the years presented.

The Company has portions of its labor force that are a part of collective bargaining agreements. A work
stoppage or other limitation on operations could occur as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining
agreements with labor unions or government-based work counsels or in connection with negotiations of new
collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 24% of the Company’s labor force is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1% of the Company’s labor
force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire within one year.

**Other segment information**

Information on total assets by segment is not disclosed, as the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker
does not evaluate reportable segments using total asset information.

**21. Subsequent events**

**Kale Kimya Agreement**

In January 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Kale Kimya, a leading regional
specialty chemical distributor in Turkey, for cash consideration of €125 million, subject to closing adjustments, and
contingent consideration of up to €7 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.

**ChemSol Group Acquisition**

In February 2023, the Company acquired ChemSol Group, a leading ingredients and specialty chemical
distributor in Central America, for cash consideration of approximately $19 million, subject to closing adjustments,

**Univar Solutions Inc.**
**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)**

**1.** **Basis of presentation**

**_Financial statement presentation_**

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Univar Solutions Inc. (the
“Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim reporting. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“US GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include
all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are
not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. Certain immaterial prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

**_Agreement and Plan of Merger with Windsor Parent, L.P. and Windsor Merger Sub, Inc._**

On March 13, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) with Windsor Parent, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Parent”), and Windsor Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Parent and Merger Sub
are affiliates of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo”), an alternative asset
manager, and Platinum Falcon B 2018 RSC Limited (“Platinum Falcon”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company
surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger
(the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of the Company’s common stock (other than (a) certain
shares owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise or by Parent or Merger Sub and certain shares owned
by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of the Company, (b) shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by stockholders who have properly
demanded appraisal for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and have complied with and have not waived, effectively withdrawn, or lost their right to appraisal under
Delaware law with respect to such shares, and (c) shares covered by share awards granted subject to any time-based
vesting, forfeiture, or other lapse restrictions), will be automatically converted into the right to receive $36.15 per
share in cash, without interest.

The Company’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and the Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2023. If the Merger is consummated,
the Company’s common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 at or after the Effective Time.

The Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger is subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
certain customary mutual closing conditions, including: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, (ii) the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the
receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, including other applicable antitrust and foreign investment reviews,
and (iii) the absence of any order, decree, or ruling by any other governmental entity in any jurisdiction in which
Parent or the Company have material business operations and the absence of any law, statute, rule, regulation,

F 57


-----

decree, injunction, or order in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company have material business operations
that prohibits or makes the consummation of the Merger illegal. The obligation of each party to consummate the
Merger is also conditioned upon certain unilateral closing conditions, including the other party’s representations and
warranties being accurate (subject to certain customary materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed
in all material respects all obligations and complied in all material respects with its covenants in the Merger
Agreement. The obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger is additionally conditioned upon the absence of a
material adverse effect, as specified in the Merger Agreement, on the Company since the execution of the Merger
Agreement. The availability of financing is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger.

The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional
services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. See “Note 5: Supplemental financial
information” for additional information on Merger transaction costs. The Company is required to pay Parent a
termination fee of $204.2 million in cash upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances,
including, among others, the Board of Directors effecting a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to enter into a definitive contract with
respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

The Merger Agreement also provides that a reverse termination fee of $379.2 million in cash will be
payable by Parent to the Company under specified circumstances, including, among others, if (i) Parent fails to
timely consummate the Merger following the completion of the Marketing Period (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) after the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and the Company standing ready to
consummate the Closing and (ii) Parent materially breaches its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements
under the Merger Agreement such that there is a failure of certain conditions to the Merger that is not timely cured.
The Merger Agreement further provides that a regulatory termination fee of $291.7 million in cash will be payable
by Parent to the Company under specified circumstances, including if (i) the Company or Parent terminates the
Merger Agreement as of the End Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and all conditions to Closing have been
satisfied other than regulatory-related conditions (including approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States) or (ii) the Company or Parent terminates the Merger Agreement due to a final, non-appealable order
enjoining or prohibiting the Merger that relates to an antitrust or foreign investment law.

The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not
purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement.

**_Recently adopted accounting pronouncements_**

In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 “Business Combinations” (Topic 805) - “Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets
and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 (Revenue from Contracts
with Customers). The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023, which did
not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 “Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs” (Subtopic
405-50) - “Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations” to enhance the transparency of disclosures
regarding supplier finance programs. The ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose
information about the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential
magnitude. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods
within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2023. Retrospective application of the guidance is required for all disclosures except
rollforward information, which requires prospective application. The Company adopted the standard in the first
quarter of 2023, which did not impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures as the Company has not
had significant activity under supplier finance programs.

**_ChemSol Group_**

On February 6, 2023, the Company acquired ChemSol Group, a leading ingredients and specialty chemical
distributor in Central America, for cash consideration of $18.0 million, net of cash acquired of $1.7 million and
subject to closing adjustments. Contingent consideration of up to $5.0 million was determined to have no acquisition
date fair value as certain financial targets are not expected to be achieved. The transaction was accounted for under
the acquisition method of accounting and the results of operations are included in the LATAM segment. The
preliminary purchase price allocation included identified intangible assets related to customer relationships and trade
names of $4.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and $3.2 million in goodwill, which is included in the LATAM
segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes.

**_Vicom Distribución Productos Quimicos, S.L. (“Vicom”)_**

On July 29, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Vicom, a leading regional
specialty chemical distributor in Spain and Portugal, for cash consideration of $14.5 million. The transaction was
accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of operations are included in the Europe
and the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) segment. The preliminary purchase price allocation included $3.4 million
in identified intangible assets related to customer relationships and $5.6 million in goodwill, which is included in the
EMEA segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes.

The following is a summary of goodwill activity by segment:

**(in millions)** **USA** **EMEA** **Canada** **LATAM** **Total**

**4.** **Revenue**

The Company disaggregates revenues from contracts with customers by both geographic reportable
segments and revenue contract types. Geographic reportable segmentation is pertinent to understanding the
Company’s revenues, as it aligns with how the Company reviews the financial performance of its operations.
Revenue contract types are differentiated by the type of good or service the Company offers customers, since the
contractual terms necessary for revenue recognition are unique to each of the identified revenue contract types.

The following table disaggregates external customer net sales by major category:

**Three months ended March 31,**

**(in millions)** **2023** **2022**

USA
Chemical distribution ....................................................................... $ 1,652.4 $ 1,777.1

Services ............................................................................................ 79.0 69.2

Total external customer net sales ............................................................... $ 2,684.9 $ 2,882.6

**_Deferred revenue_**

Deferred revenues are recognized as contract liabilities when customers provide the Company with
consideration prior to the Company satisfying its performance obligations and are recognized in revenue when the
performance obligations are met. Deferred revenues relate to revenues that are expected to be recognized within one
year and are recorded within other accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred
revenues as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $6.9 million and $15.3 million, respectively.

Revenue recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 from amounts included in
contract liabilities at the beginning of the respective periods was $12.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries participate in a multi-currency, notional cash pooling arrangement
with a third-party bank provider to manage global liquidity requirements (the “Notional Cash Pool”). Under the
Notional Cash Pool, cash deposited by participating subsidiaries is pledged as security against the overdraft balances
of other participating subsidiaries, providing legal rights of offset. As a result, the balances are presented on a net
basis within cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2023, the net
cash position of the Notional Cash Pool was $39.4 million, which consisted of a gross cash balance of $73.4 million
less a bank overdraft balance of $34.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the net cash position of the Notional Cash
Pool was $52.9 million, which consisted of a gross cash balance of $69.8 million less a bank overdraft balance of
$16.9 million.

**_Allowance for doubtful accounts_**

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be
incurred over the life of the trade accounts receivable. Collectability of the trade accounts receivable balance is
assessed on an ongoing basis and determined based on the delinquency of customer accounts, the financial condition
of individual customers, past collections experience, and future economic expectations. Changes in the allowance
for doubtful accounts were as follows:

**(in millions)**

**6.** **Earnings per share**

The following table presents the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

**Three months ended March 31,**

**(in millions, except per share data)** **2023** **2022**

Net income ......................................................................................................... $ 83.1 $ 180.8

Income per common share
Basic ............................................................................................................... $ 0.53 $ 1.07
Diluted ............................................................................................................ $ 0.52 $ 1.06

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, weighted average common shares for stock-based
compensation awards that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive were less than 0.1 million.

On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman”), which was accounted for as an open market repurchase of its common
stock on the trade date and a forward contract indexed to its common stock. Refer to “Note 10: Share repurchase
program and stock-based compensation” for additional information. The Company reflected the initial share
delivery as an immediate reduction in common shares outstanding. The effect of the forward contract was excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings per share until final settlement in February 2023 as its inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive.

**7.** **Debt**

**_Short-term financing_**

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding short-term financing facilities of $1.2 million related
to bank overdrafts. The Company had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022.

The Company had $129.3 million and $127.7 million of outstanding letters of credits as of March 31, 2023
and December 31, 2022, respectively.

31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

**_Other Information_**

The fair values of debt were based on current market quotes for similar borrowings and credit risk adjusted
for liquidity, margins, and amortization, as necessary, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

**_Multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability_**

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized its best estimate of a withdrawal
liability of $31.2 million related to triggering events at all eight sites of the Central States, Southeast, and Southwest
Areas Pension Plan (“Central States Pension Fund”), culminating in the Company ceasing to participate in the
Central States Pension Fund. Upon an agreed final funding assessment with the Central States Pension Fund, the
Company will recognize any differences between the estimated and actual withdrawal liability. As of March 31,
2023, this balance has not been adjusted and represents the Company’s best estimate of its withdrawal liability.

The Company estimates its cash obligation to be approximately $1.9 million annually for 20 years
subsequent to an agreed final funding assessment with the Central States Pension Fund. The net present value of the
withdrawal liability was determined using a risk-free interest rate. Amounts associated with the withdrawal liability
are included in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

**9.** **Income taxes**

The income tax expense and effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022
were as follows:

**Three months ended March**

**31,**

**(in millions)** **2023** **2022**

Income tax expense ............................................................................................ $ 25.3 $ 64.7
Effective income tax rate .................................................................................... 23.3% 26.4%

The Company’s 2023 effective income tax rate was higher than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%,
primarily due to higher rates on foreign earnings, US tax on foreign earnings, US state income taxes, and nondeductible employee costs.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into US law. Effective for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2022, the IRA imposes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on share
repurchases, and creates and extends certain tax-related energy incentives. The tax-related provisions of the IRA do
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**10.** **Share repurchase program and stock-based compensation**

**_Share repurchase program_**

On November 1, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share
repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock, which expires on October 27, 2026.
On November 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the amount

F 64


-----

of authorized repurchases under the program of $1.0 billion, resulting in a total authorized repurchase amount of
$1.5 billion. The program does not require the repurchase of any minimum number of shares and can be suspended,
modified, or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. Under the share repurchase program, the
Company may purchase shares from time to time at the discretion of management through open market purchases,
privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs, or other
means.

On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into an ASR with Goldman to repurchase $200.0 million of
its common stock. On November 3, 2022, the Company paid $200.0 million to Goldman and received an initial
delivery of approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock, which represented 75% of the notional value of
the ASR divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 1, 2022. The final number of
shares repurchased under the ASR was based on the daily volume-weighted average prices for Rule 10b-18 eligible
transactions in the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR, less a discount and subject to adjustment
pursuant to the terms of the ASR. At final settlement in February 2023, the Company received an additional delivery
of approximately 0.5 million shares of its common stock from Goldman.

As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate purchase price of the ASR was recorded as a reduction to
stockholders’ equity, consisting of a $150.0 million increase in treasury stock to reflect the value of the initial share
delivery and a $50.0 million decrease in additional paid-in capital pending final settlement of the ASR. The amount
recorded in additional paid-in capital was reclassified to treasury stock in the first quarter of 2023 in connection with
the final settlement of the ASR.

In addition to the ASR, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 0.1 million shares for
$2.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and approximately 0.7 million shares for $24.0 million
during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The Company’s remaining stock repurchase authorization under the
program was approximately $1,038.4 million as of March 31, 2023. While the Merger Agreement is in effect, the
Company is prohibited from repurchasing shares of its common stock, except in limited circumstances detailed in
the Merger Agreement. In this regard, the Company’s ability to make repurchases pursuant to the share repurchase
program is limited to an amount not to exceed $300.0 million per fiscal year.

**_Stock-based compensation_**

The Company grants stock-based compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors under
the Univar Solutions Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Most of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards
to employees are granted in the first quarter of each year.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company granted the following stock-based awards to
employees:

    - 671,702 of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with a weighted-average fair value of $34.69 per share; and

    - 245,600 of performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) with a weighted-average fair value of
$36.44 per share.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company has unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs of $29.6 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years, and nonvested PRSUs of $11.9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

**11.** **Derivatives**

**_Foreign currency derivatives_**

The Company uses forward currency contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange rates
relating to certain of the Company’s intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies. These derivative instruments are not formally designated as cash flow hedges by the Company and the
terms of these instruments range from one to three months.

F 65


-----

**_Interest rate swap contracts_**

The objective of the Company’s designated interest rate swap contracts is to offset the variability of cash
flows in LIBOR and SOFR indexed debt interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rates
related to the Term B-6 Loan (previously the Term B-3 Loan) and a portion of debt outstanding under the Senior
ABL Credit Facility (previously the North American ABL Facility).

In March 2023, the Company executed two interest rate swap contracts, both effective June 30, 2023, to
reduce its exposure to interest rate risk on floating rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts contain an aggregate
notional value of $400.0 million through June 2028.

In June 2021, the Company executed two interest rate swap contracts, both effective June 30, 2023, to
replace existing interest rate swap contracts with maturities occurring between June 2023 and June 2024. These
interest rate swap contracts contain an initial aggregate notional value of $250.0 million from June 2023 to June
2024 that increases to an aggregate notional value of $500.0 million from June 2024 to May 2028.

The Company also uses undesignated interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate variability.

**_Cross currency swap contracts_**

Cross currency swap contracts are used to effectively convert the Term B-5 Loan’s principal amount of
floating rate US dollar-denominated debt, including interest payments, to fixed-rate Euro-denominated debt. The
cross currency swap contracts mature in November 2024 and approximately 95% of the contracts are designated as a
cash flow hedge.

The Company also uses undesignated cross currency swap contracts to manage interest rate variability and
mitigate foreign exchange exposure.

The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates
for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is determined by
estimating the net present value of amounts to be paid under the agreement offset by the net present value of the
expected cash inflows based on market rates and associated yield curves. Based on these valuation methodologies,
these derivative contracts are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

**13.** **Commitments and contingencies**

**_Litigation_**

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to pending or threatened claims, lawsuits,
regulatory matters, and administrative proceedings from time to time. Where appropriate the Company has recorded
provisions in the consolidated financial statements for these matters. The liabilities for injuries to persons or

F 68


-----

property are in some instances covered by liability insurance, subject to various deductibles and self-insured
retentions.

Other than as disclosed, the Company is not aware of any claims, lawsuits, regulatory matters, or
administrative proceedings, pending or threatened, that are likely to have a material effect on its overall financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any present or
future claims or litigation or the potential for future claims or litigation and adverse developments could negatively
impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period.

**_Asbestos Claims_**

The Company is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. The
claims result primarily from an indemnification obligation related to Univar Solutions USA Inc.’s (“Univar”) 1986
purchase of McKesson Chemical Company from McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”). Univar is pursuing
insurance coverage for certain matters under McKesson’s historical insurance coverage to partially offset the impact
of any fees, settlements, or judgments that Univar is obligated to pay because of its obligation to McKesson. As of
March 31, 2023, there were approximately 242 asbestos-related cases for which Univar has the obligation to defend
and indemnify; however, this number tends to fluctuate up and down over time. Historically, the vast majority of
these asbestos cases have been dismissed without payment or with a nominal payment. While the Company is
unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the
ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material effect on its overall financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

**_Canada Revenue Agency_**

In October 2022, the Company received notice from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) proposing that
certain historical financing transactions between one of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries (Univar Canada Ltd.)
and one of the Company’s US subsidiaries (Univar Holdco Canada LLC) should be recharacterized as equity and
not debt for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The CRA has proposed that certain deductions claimed by the Canadian
entity should be denied, resulting in additional tax due, as well as interest and penalties on the unpaid tax. The
proposed assessment against the Company, inclusive of interest and penalties of Canadian Dollar (“C$”) 22.9
million, totals C$51.9 million.

It is possible that the CRA might take a similar position in relation to two additional tax years (2017 and
2018), but the Company has not received a proposal in relation to those years. The transactions that are being
challenged by the CRA for 2015 and 2016 do not apply in periods after 2018.

The Company believes that the tax position previously taken was proper and it will defend itself as
appropriate. The Company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for this matter, as
it believes it is more likely than not that the Company’s position will be sustained.

**_Stockholder Litigation_**

In connection with the Merger Agreement, two complaints have been filed as individual actions in federal
court. The complaints are captioned O’Dell v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03314 (S.D.N.Y., April 20,
2023) and Wang v. Univar Solutions Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-03370 (S.D.N.Y., April 21, 2023) (collectively, the
“Complaints”). In addition to the Complaints, on April 25, 2023, May 1, 2023, and May 2, 2023, purported
stockholders of the Company sent demand letters (the “Demands,” and together with the Complaints, the “Actions”)
in connection with the Merger Agreement.

The Actions generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on April 13, 2023
in connection with the Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly
material information. The Actions assert violations of Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder by the Company and the members of its Board of Directors. The Actions seek, among other
things: to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement unless and until the

F 69


-----

purportedly material information omitted from the Preliminary Proxy is disclosed; rescission or rescissory damages
in the event the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated; direction for an accounting
to the plaintiffs for all damages suffered as a result of the purported wrongdoing; an award of costs and
disbursements of the actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses; and any other relief the
court may deem just and proper.

The Company cannot predict the outcomes of the Actions but believes that they are without merit. If
additional similar complaints are filed or demands are sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, the
Company will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or demands.

**_Environmental_**

The Company is subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that require
environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively “environmental remediation work”) and from time to
time the Company becomes aware of compliance matters regarding possible or alleged violations of these laws or
regulations. For example, over the years, the Company has been identified as a “potentially responsible party”
(“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and/or similar state
laws that impose liability for costs relating to environmental remediation work at various sites. As a PRP, the
Company may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of certain sites. The Company is
currently engaged in environmental remediation work at approximately 126 locations, some that are now or were
previously Company-owned/occupied and some that were never Company-owned/occupied (“non-owned sites”).

The Company’s environmental remediation work at some sites is being conducted pursuant to
governmental proceedings or investigations. At other sites, the Company, with appropriate state or federal agency
oversight and approval, is conducting the environmental remediation work voluntarily. The Company is currently
undergoing remediation efforts or is in the process of active review of the need for potential remediation efforts at
approximately 106 current or formerly Company-owned/occupied sites. In addition, the Company may be liable as a
PRP for a share of the clean-up of approximately 20 non-owned sites. These non-owned sites are typically (a)
locations of independent waste disposal or recycling operations with alleged or confirmed contaminated soil and/or
groundwater to which the Company may have shipped waste products or drums for re-conditioning, or (b)
contaminated non-owned sites near historical sites owned or operated by the Company or its predecessors from
which contamination is alleged to have arisen.

In determining the appropriate level of environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors
such as information obtained from investigatory studies; the scope of remediation (including any changes over
time); the interpretation, application, and enforcement of laws and regulations; changes in the costs of remediation
programs; the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; and the relative level of the Company’s
involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. The level of annual expenditures for
remedial, monitoring, and investigatory activities will change in the future as major components of planned
remediation activities are completed and the scope, timing, and costs of existing activities are changed. Project lives,
and therefore cash flows, may range from 2 to 30 years, depending on the specific site and type of remediation
project.

Although the Company believes that its accruals are adequate for environmental contingencies, it is
possible, due to the uncertainties noted above, that additional accruals could be required in the future that could have
a material effect on the overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period.

Changes in total environmental liabilities, which were measured on an undiscounted basis, were as follows:

**(in millions)**
Environmental liabilities as of December 31, 2022 .............................................................. $ 90.9
Revised obligation estimates ............................................................................................ 3.7
Payments .......................................................................................................................... (5.9)
Environmental liabilities as of March 31, 2023 .................................................................... $ 88.7

As of March 31, 2023, receivables for insurance recoveries of $6.7 million and $9.8 million were recorded
within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, receivables for insurance recoveries of $6.7 million and $9.3 million were
recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. No insurance recoveries were recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2023.
Insurance recoveries of $9.2 million were recorded within warehousing, selling, and administrative expenses in the
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

**14.** **Segments**

The Company’s operations are structured into four reportable segments that represent the geographic areas
under which it operates and manages the business. Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker,
monitors the operating results of its reportable segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about
resource allocation and performance assessment. Management evaluates performance of its reportable segments on
the basis of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of consolidated net income; depreciation;
amortization; net interest expense; income tax expense; impairment charges; (gain) loss on sale of business; other
operating expenses, net and other (expense) income, net (for both, see “Note 5: Supplemental financial
information”).

Transfer prices between reportable segments are set on an arms-length basis in a similar manner to
transactions with third parties. Corporate operating expenses that directly benefit segments have been allocated to
the reportable segments. Allocable operating expenses are identified through a review process by management. The
allocable operating expenses are assigned to the reportable segments on a basis that reasonably approximates the use
of services, which is generally measured based on a weighted distribution of margin, asset, headcount, or time spent.

Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows:
