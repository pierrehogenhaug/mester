1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,320,BASIS OF PRESENTATION,320.1,,320.1.1,,"This offering memorandum contains historical financial statements and financial information of Univar for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023. Univar’s fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. The Issuer was formed on March 9, 2023 and has conducted limited activities prior to the Transactions. Therefore, no historical financial statements or financial information of the Issuer are presented in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum also presents unaudited pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2023 gives effect to the Transactions as if they occurred on March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data gives effect to the Transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, including the historical financial data and pro forma adjustments for the Transactions, has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022, and then adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 are based on the historical consolidated audited annual and unaudited interim financial statements of Univar. The unaudited pro forma data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma information presented in this offering memorandum is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the Transactions been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information presented in this offering memorandum does not purport to project our future financial position or operating results. The information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to, and does not, comply with all of the disclosure requirements of the SEC that would apply if this offering were being made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. Additionally, the financial information included in this offering memorandum will not be subject to review by the SEC. Compliance with such requirements could require the modification or exclusion of certain financial measures and/or other information included in this offering memorandum and the inclusion of certain information not included in this offering memorandum. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this offering memorandum to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to the Issuer and each of its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Merger. iv -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.1,,1100.1.1,,"We present EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization in this offering memorandum because we believe they provide investors with additional information to measure our performance and evaluate our ability to service our indebtedness. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about certain items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future as well as other items. Further, we believe Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization provide a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use the metrics for evaluating our business performance and understanding certain significant items. EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization are not presentations made in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and our use of the terms EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization varies from others in our industry. EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA: - excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; - does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; - does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; and - excludes the impact of certain non-operating accounts, such as interest income. In addition, Reported Adjusted EBITDA: - excludes impairment charges; - excludes the impact of gain and losses on the sale of businesses; - excludes transaction and integration related expenses; - excludes stock-based compensation expense; - excludes restructuring charges, employee severance costs and facility closure costs; - excludes multi-employer pension plan exit liability, certain pension gains and non-operating retirement benefits; v ----- - excludes gain on sale of property, plant and equipment; - excludes the impact of gains and losses due to foreign currencies; - excludes the impact of undesignated derivate instruments, debt refinancing costs and fair value adjustments for warrants; - excludes discrete tax items; and - excludes certain other adjustments, which may include non-recurring and/or non-cash income and expenses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA: - includes the impact of transactional gains and losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; - aligns rent expense, which is recorded on a straight-line basis, to actual cash outflows per the lease agreements, in accordance with GAAP; - excludes the impact of other non-recurring items, such as sublease income and an environmental provision, as well as the equal and offsetting insurance recovery receivable; and - excludes certain net losses from unconsolidated joint ventures net of cash dividends received. Further, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA: - excludes the impact of the supply chain disruption and destocking in 2022, including a normalization adjustment for temporary pricing surges within the first three fiscal quarters of 2022, as well as subsequent destocking in the fourth quarter of 2022; - includes estimated cost savings and acquisition related synergies; - excludes the impact of exited businesses and includes the pre-acquisition impact of acquired businesses; and - does not reflect the impact of earnings, charges or expenses resulting from matters that we may consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Further, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization: - includes the impact of the supply chain disruption and destocking in 2022 that is excluded from the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Reported Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods is consistent with the basis of presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in Univar’s prior public filings and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum differs from the presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in Univar’s prior public filings for the reasons stated above. Our definitions of Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization allow us to add back certain non-cash and non-recurring charges or costs that are deducted in calculating net income. However, some of these are expenses that involved cash, may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain of these expenses can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. vi ----- Because of these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results and use EBITDA, Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization only supplementally. For more information on the use of non-GAAP financial information, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,Products and End Markets,"We source and inventory commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads directly from producers and break down the bulk quantities to repackage, market, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers. In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers. We also have state-of-the-art solution centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles. Each of these locations is staffed by a team of chemists and food scientists, many with doctorate-level educations. At the heart of our business model are our highly trained professionals with deep industry experience within the specific markets they serve. We serve a diverse set of end markets and regions, with no end market accounting for more than 18% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The following charts illustrate the geographical and end market diversity of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022: 2 ----- 3 ----- We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the market and allow us to compete across our end markets: - we operate an expansive North American site network and approximately 80% of our U.S. manufacturing GDP is located within a 60-minute drive time from one or more of our facilities; - we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and maintain appropriate inventory levels throughout the year to ensure security of supply to our customers; - we have invested in a strong digital platform that allows us to identify orders, target customers, access real-time pricing information and ensure the availability of freight-logical product where and when it is needed; - we offer competitive pricing for our products while delivering attractive levels of profitability; and - we are contracted and work closely with the leading suppliers in the industry and maintain an expert sales force with deep ties to customers to market and sell their product into the market. We have established clear goals within our C&S channel. We are targeting organic growth of over 100 basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 22% over the next three to five years. We also have clear strategic priorities for C&S to ensure we continue to gain share within our core markets and continue our track record of delivering strong growth, including: - execution of strategic capital investments to ensure high levels of service, improved safety and the ability to maximize growth in a dynamic market; - continuing to compete successfully at the local level with global scale, matching the intensity of our more regional competitors with our advantageous size and scale; and - remaining “Easy to Do Business With” for our customers and suppliers as a trusted distributor in our industry. _I&S. Our Ingredients and Specialties channel serves a more value added, higher-growth portion of the_ market tailored to specific end market requirements. For each I&S market, we have dedicated sales, marketing, product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of the markets they serve. We represent approximately 500 strategic specialty and ingredient chemical suppliers and sell their portfolios to approximately 42,000 customer locations around the world. These specialty products are typically sold in lower volumes, but at a higher gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), than commodity products. These products also tend to provide “sticky” business as they become vital components to customers’ procurement needs. In I&S, sustained growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce effectiveness, delivering solutions through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our comprehensive supply chain infrastructure. I&S focuses on seven global markets and is serviced through our Life Sciences (Beauty & Personal Care, Food Ingredients and Pharmaceutical Ingredients) and Industrial Solutions (CASE, Homecare & Industrial Cleaning and Lubricant & Metalworking Fluids) businesses. We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the market and allow us to compete across our customer and end markets: - strong formulation know-how and application laboratories to innovate with customers, including through our industry-leading laboratory capabilities; - ability to meet our customers’ needs with a comprehensive product portfolio and industry focus sales, marketing and product management; - reliable “on time in full” delivery and supply assurance, underpinned by strong relationships between customers and company service representatives; and - partnerships with high-quality suppliers and brands with high-quality products across end markets, including securing exclusive relationships for premium parts of our portfolio where we operate symbiotically with our suppliers. 4 ----- 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.2,,"We are a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as a provider of value-added services, to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals and ingredients from thousands of producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell those materials safely to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120 countries. Our go-to-market approach focuses on leveraging the scale of our operations and our local industry and geographic knowledge to create differentiated value for our customers and suppliers. This is primarily achieved through our Chemicals & Services (“C&S”) channel, through which we can leverage the scale of our operations and is intensely focused on customer service, and our Ingredients & Specialties (“I&S”) channel, which focuses on specialty chemicals and ingredients paired with in-depth technical expertise. This dualchannel approach allows us to meet the specific needs of each customer across their entire product development, commercialization, and raw material purchasing journey, creating value across the entire customer production chain. Our C&S channel features a broad portfolio of commodity products and we believe that our focus on customer service in this business channel allows us to gain a competitive advantage over other players operating in the market. Our I&S channel leverages the breadth of our supplier and customer relationships and a technically focused sales process aimed at achieving new authorizations and customer and volume retention. We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, including approximately 9,700 employees and 600 facilities, supported by the largest private transportation fleet in the industry: approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers; and approximately 2,500 railcars, 120 rail and barge terminals and 20 deep sea terminals, focused on timely and safe delivery to a spectrum of customers, large and small. With our global sales force, a vast supplier network, unparalleled logistics know-how, deep market and regulatory knowledge, world-class formulation and recipe development, and industry-leading digital tools, we are committed to helping customers and suppliers anticipate and navigate today’s challenges and capture the meaningful growth opportunities that exist in their industries. Beyond traditional distribution services, our value-added services include e-commerce, digital marketing, chemical waste management, on-site storage, packaging, private label and technical application and formulation support for industries such as Beauty and Personal Care, Food, Pharma, Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants and Elastomers (“CASE”), Lubricants and Metalworking, Homecare and Industrial Cleaning, 1 ----- Agricultural, Water Treatment, and Electronics. Our scale, along with our dense logistics network, longstanding regulatory permits, exclusive product offering of premier brands, centralized business technology infrastructure, industry-leading safety record, and value-added services, along with established relationships with the leading chemicals and ingredients producers in our industry allow us to meet the end market, technical development, and material supply needs of our customers, while serving as an extension of our premier suppliers. This approach allows us to execute an intense focus on service, while lowering costs. While the global chemical distribution industry is large and highly fragmented, with thousands of distributors, it represents a relatively small portion of all chemical industry sales. While the total chemical and ingredient industry is projected to grow at rates close to the gross national product of the countries in which we operate around the world, the distributed chemicals portion of the industry is projected to grow at a faster rate as producers and customers increasingly realize the economic benefits of this channel. Suppliers rely on us to warehouse, repackage, transport, market and sell their products as a way to expand their industry access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their chemical and ingredient sourcing process through access to just-in-time delivery, excellent product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals fully compliant with increasing local and federal regulations. Chemical distributors play an essential role within the global chemical and ingredient value chain by providing customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals that create value-added products. While certain chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also thousands of smaller, regional customers who may be more economically served by distributors given their more “local” reach and last-mile expertise. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $2.7 billion in net sales, $83.1 million of net income and $215.4 million in Reported Adjusted EBITDA. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we generated $11.5 billion in net sales, $545.3 million of net income and $1,045.9 million in Reported Adjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $11.3 billion in net sales, $447.6 million of net income, $972.7 million in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and $1,028.0 million in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization.

While certain chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also thousands of 7 ----- smaller, regional customers who may be may be more economically served by distributors given their more “local” reach and last-mile expertise. Distributors fill this gap by purchasing chemicals and ingredients from producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell those chemicals to customers through a more regional supply chain and at volumes that may be meaningfully below traditional order sizes for producers. The chemical distribution market is highly fragmented due to the diverse range of products, services, customers, and its regionalized nature. While the industry consists of tens of thousands of players, scaled distributors have some competitive advantages due to their existing capital investment, significant logistics networks and experience operating in a highly regulated environment. As of 2022, the estimated size of the market for chemical consumption is approximately $4,800 billion, of which approximately $1,500 billion is for chemicals considered nondistributable (e.g., products that travel to customers through pipelines), resulting in a market for distributable chemical consumption of approximately $3,300 billion. Within this market, it is estimated that only 11% is currently served through distributors globally. Since 2015, the distribution market has grown steadily at approximately 3-5% year over year. From 2019-2022, the market experienced an increased growth rate of approximately 4-5%, underpinned by increased pricing throughout COVID-19 driven by supply chain constraints, which is expected to normalize in 2023. In the period from 2023 through 2027, the chemical distribution market is expected to grow at approximately 45%.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.1,Attractive industry with significant demand tailwinds in strong end markets to fuel long-term organic growth,"Chemicals distributors serve as key intermediaries between customers and producers to sell products that are cost-ineffective for larger producers. We are well positioned to benefit from the growing trend of chemical and ingredient producers and customers outsourcing key tasks to distributors. Third-party chemical and ingredient distribution represents a small portion of the market, with distributors underpenetrated relative to other industries (including building materials, steel, auto parts and others). However, the market remains large with global third-party chemical distribution industry sales of approximately $320 billion in 2022. Historically, chemical distribution was viewed as a channel to reach smaller customers but is increasingly important to larger customers. The relatively low current penetration rate, combined with rising regulatory requirements, an increased focus on ESG, customer regionalization, and supplier globalization, are expected to be strong tailwinds for increased outsourcing penetration across both specialty and commodity chemicals. It is a highly fragmented industry with a significant number of small, local participants; our scale provides a meaningful competitive advantage. As a full-line distributor with a strong, highly scaled supply-chain-network across a broad geographic region, we are well suited to help customers and producers consolidate their distributor relationships and lower their total costs of ownership while improving upon their service levels. Amidst a backdrop of industry-wide underinvestment in software and digitization, we have a “First Mover” advantage derived from our leading proprietary platform. Our advanced centralized business platform simplifies logistics and reduces complexity and costs. As one of the leaders in chemical and ingredient distribution, we believe we can accelerate this trend by increasing the attractiveness of our total value proposition to both customers and our suppliers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

If so, on the issue date, pending consummation of the Merger, the gross proceeds from this offering will be deposited into a segregated escrow account pledged on a first-priority basis as collateral for the benefit of holders of the notes (with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as escrow agent, pursuant to an escrow agreement) together with an additional amount of cash or cash equivalents in an amount that, when taken together with the rights to receive any cash or cash equivalents under one or more letters of credit or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters, would equal the amount of interest that would accrue on the notes to, but excluding, July 31, 2023.

In addition, the indenture governing the notes will permit us to secure additional indebtedness with liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and the Notes Priority Collateral under certain circumstances. The agent for the ABL Facility, the agent for the Term Loan Facility, the Trustee and the collateral agent for the notes will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “ABL Intercreditor Agreement”) to set forth the relative priorities of the liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and the Notes Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the notes. Pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the ABL Facility and the holders of certain debt (including certain hedging, cash management and bank product obligations) will receive priority treatment with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the security interest in or other recoveries from the ABL Priority Collateral. See “Description of Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreements—ABL Intercreditor 26 ----- Agreement.” In addition, the administrative agent for the Term Loan Facility, the Trustee and the collateral agent for the notes and the Term Loan Facility will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) governing the relationship between the lenders under the Term Loan Facility and holders of the notes as well as holders of any other indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the notes and the Term Loan Facility. See “Description of Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreements—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” Optional Redemption .............................** Prior to               , 2026, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the applicable redemption date plus the applicable “make-whole” premium.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Change of Control ..................................** Upon certain events constituting a change of control under the indenture governing the notes, the holders of the notes will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to (but excluding) the date of purchase. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” Asset Sales ...............................................** If we sell certain assets, under certain circumstances we may be required to offer to purchase the notes as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.” Certain Covenants ..................................** The indenture governing the notes, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; - pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments; - make investments; - consummate certain asset sales; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - grant or assume certain liens; and - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

Reported Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods is consistent with the basis of presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in Univar’s public filings and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used to assess operating performance, is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum for historical periods is not consistent with the basis of presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in Univar’s prior public filings, but rather reflects a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA that will be permitted by the indenture, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the items set forth below. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization is Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA including the impact of the supply chain disruption and destocking in 2022 that is excluded from the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Each of the above described EBITDA-based measures is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, each such measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flows available for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Such measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of such measures in isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. The Issuer compensates for the limitations of using nonGAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” The Issuer believes EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because EBITDA excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. In addition, EBITDA provides more comparability between the historical operating results and pro forma operating results that reflect the acquisition method of accounting and the new capital structure. The Issuer believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Reported Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Before Normalization are appropriate to provide additional information to investors in our debt about certain material non-cash items and about certain items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future as well as others. The Issuer expects to use Pro Forma 32 ----- Adjusted EBITDA internally to make operating decisions and believes this measure is helpful to investors because it allows period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results. The information can also be used to perform trend analyses and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted. Finally, the Issuer believes such information provides a higher degree of transparency. The indenture, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility, the credit agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and other debt agreements will permit us to exclude other charges and expenses and make other or different adjustments in calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

(b) Represents an adjustment to exclude non-operating charges (income), including (i) non-operating retirement benefits, as well as pension mark to market and curtailment and settlement (gains) losses, (ii) gains and losses associated with undesignated foreign currency derivatives and swaps, (iii) revaluation gains and losses on the Company’s loans, (iv) transactional foreign exchange gains and (losses), (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (vi) debt refinancing costs, and (vii) the fair value revaluation of the Company’s warrants. (c) Represents an adjustment to remove non-cash impairment charges from adjusted earnings. (d) Represents an adjustment to exclude the loss (gain) associated with the sale of the Canada Agriculture Services business in 2020 and the sale of the Distrupol business in 2021. (e) Represents an adjustment to remove a one-time charge incurred related to a change in treatment of Brazilian value added taxes (“VAT”). (f) Represents the estimated management fee payable to an affiliate of Apollo commencing after the close of the Merger. (g) Represents an adjustment to include the Company’s transactional realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and (losses). (h) Represents an adjustment to present the Company’s rent expense to actual cash rent payments made per the lease agreements. (i) Represents an adjustment to (i) remove the net income from unconsolidated joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting and (ii) include cash dividends received from the unconsolidated joint ventures. (j) Represents an adjustment to remove other non-recurring items such as (i) sublease income, and (ii) an environmental provision that was recorded in 2021, with an equal and offsetting insurance recovery receivable recorded in 2022. (k) Represents an adjustment to normalize the supply chain disruption and destocking impact on the Company’s operations in 2022. This adjustment attempts to normalize temporary pricing surges within the first three quarters of 2022, as well as the earnings impact of destocking in the fourth quarter of 2022. See below for further detail: i. During 2022, market prices of certain product categories increased significantly due to low overall supply in the market. Since the Company was able to maintain its supply during the period, the Company benefited from the temporary increase in pricing. This adjustment removes the net earnings impact of this significant pricing event net of related sales bonuses of $144.5 million. ii. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the industry experienced a significant destocking event as a result of supply chain disruptions. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company experienced a significant decrease in volume. This adjustment normalizes fourth quarter 2022 EBITDA by including the estimated earnings of $25.7 million that the Company would have earned absent this industry wide destocking event. (l) Represents additional estimated operational cost savings over a period of time through various initiatives such as (i) approximately $4 million of savings as a result of warehouse operations improvement and consolidation, (ii) approximately $7 million of savings driven by fleet and logistics improvements, (iii) approximately $39 million of organizational and general and administrative expense optimization, including public company cost savings as the Company will be taken private, (iv) approximately $14 million of savings driven by direct and indirect procurement optimization, and (v) approximately $11 million of savings as a result of go to market channel optimization. These estimates are based on the current estimates of the Issuer, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Issuer to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by estimates. To achieve this level of annual cost savings, we expect to incur approximately $37 million of one-time costs (approximately $25 million in 2024 and $12 million in 2025). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings and synergies, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.” 34 ----- (m) Removes the EBITDA associated with the Company’s divestiture of the Russia Joint Venture. (n) Represents an adjustment to include the pre-acquisition EBITDA of businesses that the Company acquired or signed a purchase agreement to acquire on a pro forma basis, including Vicom, Kale Kimya, and Chemsol. (o) Represents estimated pro forma synergies associated with the Company’s acquisitions of Kale Kimya and Chemsol. This adjustment is primarily related to (i) margin and volume expansion from leveraging suppliers and new supplier authorizations, net of estimated incremental operating expenses to service the increased volume, and (ii) cost savings through removal of duplicative operating expenses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings and synergies, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.” (2) Working Capital is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities as presented in the historical and pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. (3) The ratio of net first-lien debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the notes, net of expected unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $100.0 million as of the closing date of the Transactions, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. (4) The ratio of net total debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the notes, net of expected unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $100.0 million as of the closing date of the Transactions, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. (5) The ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by dividing Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by pro forma cash interest expense. Pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by adjusting total cash interest expense to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the notes, borrowings under the Credit Facilities and the repayment of the Existing Facilities and redemption of the Existing Notes. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” for a discussion of the assumptions used when calculating pro forma cash interest expense. Actual cash interest expense will primarily depend upon the interest rates payable on the notes and the Credit Facilities and excludes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the full year or any future period.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data has been prepared as if the Transactions occurred on March 31, 2023. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information herein has been adjusted to depict the accounting for the Transactions, which reflect the application of the accounting required by GAAP, linking the effects of the Transactions to the historical consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data includes all adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of the pro formal financial information. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial position actually would have been if the Transactions had occurred at any other date, and such data does not purport to project our results of operations for any future period. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma information presented, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering memorandum and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary asset and liability valuations. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon closing of the Merger will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and the actual balance of our net assets on the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of the purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data, including a change to goodwill and net income. The summary historical and pro forma condensed consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical consolidated financial statements of Univar and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. 30 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

As of the date hereof, the parties have received antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico and the United States, and foreign direct investment approval in Italy. We can provide no assurance that all conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.

As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.

Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect Univar’s ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. A substantial amount of Univar management’s and employees’ attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger and thus is being diverted from Univar’s day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to Univar’s future could adversely affect its business and its relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with Univar, or seek to change existing business relationships with Univar. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect Univar’s revenue, earnings and financial condition.

Our ability to realize the expected cost savings and synergies associated with the adjustments included or permitted by the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities to be included when calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions.

We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures will not be higher than we anticipate, and we may need to incur incremental costs to achieve such cost savings and synergies or additional cost savings or synergies. In addition, we will not fully realize such cost savings or synergies within 12 to 18 months of the completion of the Merger, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings and synergies. Our ability to realize these anticipated savings and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. In addition, any cost savings or synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For example, reducing sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. Our expected cost savings and synergies are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. Our calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for estimated cost savings and synergies expected to be implemented. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, investors should not place undue reliance upon the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA given how it is calculated and the possibility that the underlying estimates and assumptions may ultimately not reflect actual results. There can be no assurances that we will achieve the cost savings and synergies that we or our independent third party consultant have identified within the time frames that we or our independent third party consultant expect or at all. If our cost savings and synergies are less than our estimates or our cost savings initiatives adversely affect our business or cost more or take longer to ----- implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results could be lower than we anticipate. As a result, our future performance may differ significantly from the pro forma condensed consolidated financial data of the Issuer set forth herein. Further, no third party, including our independent auditor or any of the initial purchasers, has performed any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these estimated cost savings or synergies, or their respective achievability. In addition, the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities permit us to adjust EBITDA for items that would not meet the standards for inclusion in pro forma financial statements under accounting regulations and the other SEC rules. Some of these adjustments may be considered to be too speculative to merit adjustment under accounting regulations; however, the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the Credit Facilities would permit such adjustments for purposes of determining Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. As a result of these adjustments, we may be able to incur more debt or pay dividends or make other restricted payments in greater amounts than would otherwise be permitted without such adjustments. The future performance of the Issuer may differ significantly from the anticipated performance of the Issuer set forth herein.

Our sales are correlated with and affected by fluctuations in the levels of industrial production, manufacturing output and general economic activity. Producers of commodity and specialty chemicals are likely to reduce their output in periods of significant contraction in industrial and consumer demand, while demand for the products we distribute depends largely on trends in demand in the end markets our customers serve. A majority of our sales are in North America and Europe and our business is therefore susceptible to downturns in those economies, as well as, to a lesser extent, the economies in the rest of the world. Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our products and services, could decline as a result of a large number of factors outside our control, including the impact of pandemics and other public-health emergencies, economic recessions, reduced customer demand (whether due to changes in production processes, consumer preferences, the industries in which the customer operates, laws and regulations affecting the chemicals industry and the manner in which they are enforced, or other factors), inflation, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused growth in certain of our end markets, such as in homecare and industrial cleaning and pharmaceuticals, while other end markets, such as the upstream refining market, were materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize our growth goals and targeted gross profit margins. ----- General economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers, could affect overall demand for chemicals. Any overall decline in the demand for chemicals could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we would face increased credit risk. In addition, volatility and disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our sales and results of operations by limiting our customers’ ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain or expand their own operations. A historical feature of past economic weakness has been significant destocking of inventories, including inventories of chemicals used in industrial and manufacturing processes. It is possible that an improvement in our net sales in a particular period may be attributable in part to restocking of inventories by our customers and represent a level of sales or sales growth that will not be sustainable over the longer term. Further economic weakness could lead to insolvencies among our customers or producers, as well as among financial institutions that are counterparties on financial instruments or accounts that we hold. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Large chemical manufacturers may elect to sell certain products (or products in certain regions) directly to customers or utilize digital marketplaces, bypassing distributors such as us. While we do not believe that our results depend materially on access to any individual producer’s products, a reversal of the trend toward more active use of distributors would likely result in increasing margin pressure or products becoming unavailable to us. In addition, unpredictable events may have a significant impact on the industries in which many of our customers operate, reducing demand for products that we normally distribute in significant volumes.

Chemicals can be purchased from a variety of sources, including traders, brokers, wholesalers and other distributors, as well as directly from producers. Many of the products we distribute or finish are essentially fungible with products offered by our competitors, including emerging competitors. The competitive pressure we face is particularly strong in sectors and markets where local competitors have strong positions or where new competitors can easily enter. Increased competition from distributors of products similar to or competitive with ours could result in price reductions, reduced margins and a loss of market share. We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. We must also compete with smaller companies that have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases.

Consolidation of our competitors may also further enhance their financial position, provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers. This may jeopardize the strength of our positions in one or more of the markets in which we operate and any advantages we currently enjoy due to the comparative scale of our operations.

Damage or disruption to our collective supply or distribution capabilities resulting directly or indirectly from pandemics and other public-health emergencies, labor shortages, border closures, natural disasters, weather and physical climate change related events, lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, global trade flow disruption, increased airport and shipping port congestion, climate change, plant downtime (whether our own or others’), power outages, explosions, information technology system and/or network disruptions, terrorism, strikes or other labor unrest, or other reasons could seriously harm our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of the foregoing examples are hypothetical, but others have been or are being experienced by the Company. For example, during 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, weather events and supply constraints impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our operations. The combination of supplier shut-downs, port congestion, acute pandemic recovery demand and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have resulted in sustained supply chain constraints, product shortages and chemical price inflation.

We might not be able to pass such cost increases through to our customers. We could experience financial losses if our inventories of one or more chemicals exceed our sales and the price of those chemicals decreases significantly while in our inventories or if our inventories fall short of our sales and the purchase price of those chemicals increases significantly.,"We purchase and sell a wide variety of chemicals, the price and availability of which may fluctuate, and may be subject to large and significant price increases. For example, ongoing shortages across a range of chemicals and ingredients have generally led to fluctuations in chemical prices globally. Many of our contracts with producers include chemical prices that are not fixed or are tied to an index, which allows our producers to change the prices of the chemicals we purchase as the price of the chemicals fluctuates in the market. Changes in chemical prices affect our net sales and cost of goods sold, as well as our working capital requirements, levels of debt and financing costs. We might not always be able to reflect increases in our chemical costs, transportation costs and other costs in our own pricing. Any inability to pass cost increases onto customers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to meet customer demand, we typically maintain significant inventories, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with our inventory levels, including the following: - declines in the prices of chemicals that are held by us; - the need to maintain a significant inventory of chemicals that may be in limited supply and therefore difficult to procure; - buying chemicals in bulk for the best pricing and thereby holding excess inventory; - responding to the fluctuating demand for chemicals; - cancellation of customer orders; and - responding to customer requests for rapid delivery. In order to manage our inventories successfully, we must estimate demand from our customers and purchase chemicals that substantially correspond to that demand. If we overestimate demand and purchase too much ----- of a particular chemical, we face a risk that the price of that chemical will fall, leaving us with inventory that we cannot sell profitably or have to write down such inventory from its recorded value. If we underestimate demand and purchase insufficient quantities of a particular chemical and prices of that chemical rise, we could be forced to purchase that chemical at a higher price and forego profitability in order to meet customer demand.

Our working capital needs may increase if the price of products we purchase and inventory increase. Our working capital needs also increase at certain times of the year, as our customers’ requirements for chemicals increase. We need inventory on hand to have product available to ensure timely delivery to our customers. If our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance our working capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may not be able to obtain chemicals to respond to customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales. In addition, the amount of working capital we require to run our business is expected to increase in the future due to expansions in our business activities. Disruptions in our supply chain could also create the need to invest additional working capital in on-hand inventory than in prior years. If our working capital needs increase, the amount of free cash we have at our disposal to devote to other uses will decrease. A decrease in free cash could, among other things, limit our flexibility, including our ability to make capital expenditures and to acquire suitable acquisition targets that we have identified.

Our access to third party transportation is not guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport chemicals at economically attractive rates in certain circumstances, particularly in cases of adverse market conditions or disruptions to transportation infrastructure. In addition, we could face a challenge with attracting and retaining qualified drivers primarily due to intense market competition, which may subject us to increased payments for driver compensation. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could face difficulty meeting customer orders or be forced to forego business that would otherwise be available to us, which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our business.

We sell products used in hydraulic fracturing, a process that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into subsurface rock formations to release and capture oil and natural gas. The use of such hydraulic fracturing fluids by our customers may result in releases that could impact the environment and third parties. Several of our distribution facilities are located near, and our transportation routes could take us through, high-density population centers. If any such events occur, whether through our own fault, through preexisting conditions at our facilities, through the fault of a third party or through a natural disaster, terrorist incident or other event outside our control, our reputation could be damaged significantly. We could also become responsible, as a result of environmental or other laws or by court order, for substantial monetary damages or expensive investigative or remedial obligations related to such events, including but not limited to those resulting from third party lawsuits or environmental investigation and cleanup obligations on and off-site. The amount of any costs, including fines, damages and/or investigative and remedial obligations, that we may become obligated to pay under such circumstances could substantially exceed any insurance we have to cover such losses.

Compliance with these laws and regulations, and with the permits and licenses we hold, requires that we expend significant amounts for ongoing compliance, investigation and remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations, permits or licenses, we may be subject to fines, damages and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions and investigations, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, future changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could have an adverse effect on us by adding restrictions, reducing our ability to do business, increasing our costs of doing business, reducing our profitability or reducing the demand for our products. Previous operations, including those of acquired companies, have resulted in contamination at a number of current and former sites, which must be investigated and remediated. We have ongoing investigations and remediation activities, or are contributing to cleanup costs, at approximately 128 currently or formerly owned, operated or used sites or other sites impacted by our operations. We have spent substantial sums on such investigation and remediation and we expect to continue to incur such expenditures in the future. We may incur losses in connection with investigation and remediation obligations that exceed our environmental liabilities.

The terms of these plans vary from country to country. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with the Company’s pension plans are affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management’s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on costs and liabilities are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates and mortality rates. Changes to the funded status of our pension plans as a result of updates to actuarial assumptions and actual experience that differs from our estimates are recognized as gains or losses in the period incurred under our “mark to market” accounting policy, and could result in a requirement for additional funding. As of December 31, 2022, our pension plans were underfunded by $82.7 million. Rising interest rates have positively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. When interest rates decline, funding requirements for our pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations under these pension plans, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or incur indebtedness. The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan union sponsored multi-employer pension plan in which we participated until 2021 is also underfunded.

The guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture. The indenture governing the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the subsidiary guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture governing the notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released, which will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes.

Additionally, under the Credit Facilities, a change of control constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any repurchase of the notes and repayment of any borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in the Credit Facilities will not allow such repurchases. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations and securitizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the notes, but could affect our capital structure or credit ratings. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.” Courts interpreting change of control provisions under New York law (which will be the governing law of the indenture governing the notes) have not provided clear and consistent meanings of such change of control provisions which leads to subjective judicial interpretation.

A court might do so if it found that when we issued the notes or a subsidiary guarantor entered into its guarantee or granted any related security interests, or in some states when payments became due under the notes or the guarantees, we or such subsidiary guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business as conducted or contemplated; - believed or reasonably should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay; or - was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or the subsidiary guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. The court might also void an issuance of notes or a guarantee or any related security interests, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the notes or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee or granted any related security interests with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court passing on us or a guarantor regarding the notes or any guarantee or the related security interests would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee or any related security interests if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. Specifically, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable subsidiary guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees and any related security interests or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes or any guarantee or any related security interest, you would no longer have any claim against us or the applicable guarantor, or the right to enforce upon the underlying collateral that is the subject of the related security interest in question. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or a ----- guarantor. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the avoidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or any of the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date or that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. The guarantee by each guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor is permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, any such guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on, among other things, the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or third party within a 90-day period prior to a bankruptcy filing and such payment would give such insider or third party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Also, any future guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes might be avoidable by the guarantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by its other creditors) as a preferential transfer or otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the guarantor is insolvent at the time of the guarantee, that guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a bankruptcy case of the guarantor under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code than if such guarantee had not been given, and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. To the extent that the guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the guarantee. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors, respectively, under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”) convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities, as the rate that, in the consensus view of the ARRC, represented best practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts. The Credit Facilities will carry floating interest rates that are tied to SOFR. SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed on a daily basis and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate for specified tenors and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. As a result, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such reference rate in underlying contractual arrangements, and there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. Publication of SOFR began in April 2018 and it therefore has a limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical performance. Prior observed patterns, if any, in the behavior of market variables may change in the future. While some pre-publication historical data have been released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, such analysis inherently involves assumptions, estimates and approximations. The future performance of SOFR is impossible to predict, and therefore no future performance of SOFR may be inferred from any of the historical simulations or historical performance. Hypothetical or historical performance data are not indicative of, and have no bearing on, the potential performance of the SOFR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as administrator of SOFR, may make methodological or other changes that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to the method by which SOFR is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate SOFR or timing related to the publication of SOFR. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a change in the amount of our annual interest expense on our indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our performance, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes and other factors. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the notes may be materially and adversely affected. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may not be free from similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, the notes may trade at a discount from their value on the date you acquired the notes, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. See “Plan of Distribution.” Furthermore, recent regulatory actions by the SEC under Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act (and any potential regulatory developments stemming from the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) may restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025, which may materially affect the liquidity and trading prices for the notes.

In the event of our or any subsidiary guarantor’s bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding, the collateral must be used to pay the obligations under the Term Loan Facility and holders of certain of our hedging, cash management and bank product obligations and the notes ratably, pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement entered into for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the lenders under our Term Loan Facility, subject, in the case of the ABL Priority Collateral, to first satisfying our obligations under the ABL Facility and other obligations that are secured by a first-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the indenture governing the notes ----- will permit us and the guarantors to create additional liens under specified circumstances, including liens senior in priority and pari passu to the liens on the collateral securing the notes.

Holders of the indebtedness under the ABL Facility will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the realization of value of the ABL Priority Collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before the holders of the notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. Certain hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements that are entered into with the lenders under the ABL Facility will be secured by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility. As a result, the notes and the Term Loan Facility will effectively be junior in right of payment to indebtedness under our ABL Facility and such other obligations to the extent of the realizable value of ABL Priority Collateral and holders of the notes and lenders under the Term Loan Facility will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of the ABL Priority Collateral after all indebtedness and other obligations under the ABL Facility are repaid in full. In addition, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that is not a guarantor of the notes, including the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries that will be obligors under the ABL Facility. A substantial portion of the collateral constitutes ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also contains a number of waivers by holders of the notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Facility of important rights that otherwise accrue to secured creditors in a bankruptcy. For a more complete description, see “Description of Notes—Security.” Approximately $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the ABL Facility is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger (in addition to approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date). Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. The estimated borrowing base availability of $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023 will be updated based on a field exam and appraisal and therefore could differ as of the closing date of the Transactions. There can be no assurances that the borrowing base availability will be the same or higher in the future. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a description of the ABL Facility.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the obligations under the ABL Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a first-priority basis (including post-petition interest, fees and expenses, whether or not allowed or allowable in any bankruptcy case), will be paid with the proceeds of the ABL Priority Collateral prior to the obligations under the notes and related guarantees in certain circumstances, including in the event of any foreclosure by the lenders under the ABL Facility or a bankruptcy event. The lenders under the ABL Facility, as holders of firstpriority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, will control substantially all enforcement matters related to such ABL Priority Collateral, pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the permitted firstpriority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, including under the ABL Facility, may cause the collateral agent under the ABL Facility (the “ABL Agent”) to dispose of, release, or foreclose on, or take other actions with respect to, the ABL Priority Collateral (including certain amendments of and waivers under the security documents with respect ----- thereto) with which holders of the notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the notes, even after a default under the notes in the case of an enforcement action by the ABL Agent. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit parties with second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, including the holders of the notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Facility, from foreclosing on such collateral at any time prior to the payment in full of the permitted obligations secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Credit Facility. To the extent the ABL Priority Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the ABL Priority Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the ABL Agent, in connection with a sale or other disposition of the ABL Priority Collateral permitted under the terms of both the ABL Facility and indenture governing the senior secured or during an event of default under the ABL Facility, in connection with a sale consented to by the ABL Agent), the second-priority liens securing the notes in the ABL Priority Collateral will automatically also be released. In addition, the security documents related to the holders of the notes’ secondpriority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent and each other collateral agent party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral until such firstpriority lien obligations are paid in full, and the security documents related to the first-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the obligations under the ABL Facility may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Collateral Agent. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the notes would be required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of the obligations under the ABL Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of the ABL Priority Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the notes after payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, including all obligations under the ABL Facility. See “Description of Notes—Security.” In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of ABL Priority Collateral or debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the ABL Priority Collateral, the holders of the notes would (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the Notes Priority Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) be limited in raising objections to such use of cash collateral or DIP financing. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the holders of the notes to raise various other objections or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the ABL Facility, including, among other things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and will also place certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the ABL Priority Collateral from a bankruptcy court, even though such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control such proceedings will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility until (1) our obligations under the Term Loan Facility are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of our Term Loan Facility) or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, if the authorized representative of the holders of the notes represents the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral (other than the Term Loan Facility) and has complied with the applicable notice provisions and if the notes are at the time due and ----- payable in full. As of the issue date, Wilmington Trust, National Association, the Trustee, will be the authorized representative for the noteholders under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the administrative agent under the Term Loan Facility, will be the authorized representative for the Term Loan Facility under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Wilmington Trust, National Association will be the collateral agent for the notes and the Term Loan Facility. However, even if the authorized representative of the notes gains the right to direct the collateral agent in the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under our Term Loan Facility) if the authorized representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that collateral (whether the Issuer or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In addition, the documents governing our indebtedness will permit us, subject to certain limits, to issue additional series of notes or other debt that also have a first-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. At any time that the representative of the lenders under our Term Loan Facility does not have the right to take actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a firstpriority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. If we issue additional notes or other debt that is equal in priority to the liens securing the notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for those additional notes or other debt would be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the notes. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of the shared collateral to secure that financing, or to the use of cash collateral unless and until the authorized representative of the lenders under the Term Loan Facility object thereto, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. In addition, the collateral will exclude certain “excluded property” and the value of such excluded property could be material. See “Description of Notes—Security.” These assets that are excluded from the collateral securing the notes and related guarantees may be pledged to secure other indebtedness. Consequently, our obligations under the Credit Facilities, the notes and the related guarantees would be effectively subordinated to other indebtedness that is secured by assets not constituting collateral securing the notes, to the extent of the value of such assets. Furthermore, because Holdings will not be a guarantor, no assets of Holdings (including the capital stock of the Issuer) will secure the notes even though such assets secure the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. No appraisals of any of the collateral have been prepared by us or on behalf of us in connection with this offering. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes, the ABL ----- Facility, the Term Loan Facility and any additional future pari passu obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes, the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility and any additional future pari passu obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest, fees and expenses would cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed and you will not be entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of your claims. The security interest of the collateral agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, the collateral securing the notes is subject to liens permitted under the indenture governing the notes, whether arising on or after the date the notes are issued. The existence of any permitted liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes, as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

Rights in the collateral may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral now or in the future.","Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the collateral securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such notes if the collateral agent for the notes is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the indenture governing the notes. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements, delivery of certain stock certificates and instruments, if permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, and the filing of mortgages and other perfection actions required by the security documents. We will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to ----- have all security interests that are required to be perfected by the security documents to be in place within a specified period of time after the issue date or, if the Merger is not consummated on the issue date, the Merger Closing Date. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the collateral. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not perfected on the issue date of the notes (or, if the Merger is not consummated on the issue date, the Merger Closing Date), such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, certain intellectual property and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the collateral agent for the notes will monitor and neither has any obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the collateral agent for the notes, as applicable, against third parties. Even if the collateral agent for the notes does take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests, any such security interests that are perfected after the date of the indenture (or, if the Merger is not consummated on the issue date, the Merger Closing Date) would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on such date were no longer subject to such risk. In addition, even if the collateral agent for the notes does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired in the future, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy case under certain circumstances. See “—Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the issue date increases the risk that the security interests or such guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.” The indenture governing the notes and the security documents will not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the collateral agent for the benefit of the senior secured noteholders. As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the collateral agent for the benefit of the senior secured noteholders in a portion of the collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be subject to other liens) under applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Upon the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the collateral agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given under the particular circumstances or could be materially delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security or superpriority administrative expense claims if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for any such diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, or the length of any delay in making such payments; - whether or when the collateral agent could repossess or dispose of the collateral; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time; or - whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require prior permission from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given or could be materially delayed). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is to be paid out of the proceeds of the collateral, the holders of the notes would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of the collateral to which the holders of the notes are entitled and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall or under collateralization. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of its collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral, and the holders of the notes would not be entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of their claims. In addition, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the holders of the notes from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be ----- provided to us that is secured by the collateral securing the notes or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties thereunder, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

To the extent any security interest in the collateral securing the notes is not perfected as of the Release Date, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected within 120 days following the Release Date of the notes. Additionally, certain filings and other actions required for perfection of the liens on collateral, prior to, on and after the date of the issuance of the notes may be delayed, or not completed at all, as a result of the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any applicable registration system, filing offices or related service not being available. If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after the issue date of the notes, any security interest in other collateral, or any guarantees delivered after the issue date of the notes, would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on the issue date of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under bankruptcy law if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing or “antecedent” indebtedness. Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes, including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued, may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a year. Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the notes had been perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes (as applicable) had been issued, less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy case (or, if applicable, one year), such liens or guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable) and may be required to return prior payments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

The historical statement of operations of Univar for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was derived by adding the statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2023, and subtracting the statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2022. (2) Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows: (a) Reflects incremental depreciation resulting from the adjustment to increase the carrying amount of certain Univar property, plant and equipment to fair value in connection with acquisition accounting over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. (b) Reflects incremental amortization resulting from the adjustment of certain Univar assets to fair value in connection with acquisition accounting, including incremental expense resulting from the amortization of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. In addition, changes in the useful lives of the identified intangible assets could materially impact amortization expense upon finalization. For each 10% increase or decrease in the preliminary fair value of finite-lived intangible assets, annual amortization expense would increase or decrease by approximately $50.5 million. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using an expected benefits method of amortization. (c) Vested and unvested outstanding in-the-money stock options were converted into rights to receive $36.15 per share in cash, reduced by the applicable exercise price. Unvested outstanding restricted share awards, restricted share units and deferred share units were converted into rights to receive $36.15 per share in cash assuming the service or, in the case of certain restricted share units subject to any performance-based vesting, service, market and performance conditions are satisfied. The total amount payable at the close of the Merger in connection with such compensation awards is $115.3 million, of which $67.1 million is included in purchase price consideration. The amount attributable to the post-combination transaction period is $48.2 million, recognized immediately in the post-acquisition period, which is included for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data, increasing the share-based compensation expense recorded in the historical statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, respectively. (d) Represents $66.1 million of transaction costs recognized on a pro forma basis in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Such costs will be incurred or expected to be incurred related to the Merger subsequent to March 31, 2023. These costs will not affect the statements of operations beyond twelve months after the acquisition date. (e) Represents a one-time sponsor transaction fee of $52.0 million on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2022 as well as ongoing annual management fees payable to an affiliate of Apollo each quarter beginning after the close of the Merger. The ongoing management fee of $10.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022, $2.5 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and $10.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

After giving effect to the Transactions, assuming $500.0 million of the ABL Facility is drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $3.5 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Credit Facilities. The foregoing pro forma interest expense information does not give effect to any future hedging strategies. (b) Reflects the incremental prepayment premium related to the repayment of the Univar Existing Debt in conjunction with the Merger. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data, the prepayment premium of $11.6 million was recorded within the first fiscal quarter post-close of the Merger, based on an assumed transaction date of January 1, 2022.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, the earliest period presented, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, including the historical financial data and pro forma adjustments for the Transactions, has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022, and then adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial data includes all adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of the pro formal financial information. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data has been prepared to give effect to transactions that have occurred or are probable for which disclosure of pro forma financial information would be material to investors, as described in the notes below. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data herein has been adjusted to depict the accounting for the Transactions (“Transaction Accounting Adjustments”), which reflect the application of the accounting required by GAAP, giving effect to the Merger in the historical consolidated financial statements. In addition, pro forma adjustments have been presented related to the financing of the Merger and other material items. Items that do not meet the classification requirements as Transaction Accounting Adjustments are shown in a separate column entitled “Financing and Other Adjustments.” We elected not to present the reasonably estimable cost savings, synergies, and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (“Management’s Adjustments”) and will only be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments and Financing and Other Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data. See “Summary— Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” for a discussion of Management’s Adjustments. Pro forma adjustments were made primarily to reflect: - Transaction Accounting Adjustments: - the Merger; - changes in the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities to reflect their estimated fair values at the date of closing of the Merger, including values assigned to previously unrecognized intangible assets and related changes in amortization expenses; - transaction costs and fees in connection with the Merger; and - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax. ----- - Financing and Other Adjustments relate to probable or consummated transactions that are considered to be material to investors: - the Equity Contribution, the cash portion of which will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses; - the use of proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the proceeds from the draw on the ABL Facility to fund a portion of the Transactions, including to repay the debt outstanding under Existing Facilities and Existing Notes (collectively, the “Univar Existing Debt”) and to pay related fees and expenses, including changes in interest expense resulting therefrom and amortization of estimated debt issuance costs; and - the effect of the above adjustments on income tax. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheet would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Summary— The Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data. The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The acquisition method of accounting requires use of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data presented herein, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering memorandum and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary asset and liability valuations. The actual adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and the actual carrying value of the net assets on the closing date of the Transactions. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of purchase price, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data, including a change to goodwill and net income. Historical and pro forma earnings per share have not been presented because we do not believe such information is relevant to prospective investors of the notes.

Our sales are correlated with and affected by seasonal fluctuations and cycles in the levels of industrial production, manufacturing output and general economic activity. The current business environment in the markets in which we operate consists of complex dynamics that can change rapidly. Over the last several years, a combination of factors has impacted and disrupted global trade flows, which has resulted in dynamic and inflationary pricing conditions, in various end markets and geographies. Starting in late 2022, we began to see an abatement of significant disruption within supply chains, as well as monetary policy changes designed to increase the cost of capital and rein in inflation. These changes have put downward pressure on demand as customers throughout the value chain reduce inventory positions in favor of larger cash positions. Despite the downward pressure in demand, we continue to see strength in one of our core value propositions, which is to de-risk supply chains for our customers and suppliers. In such a dynamic environment, we are focused on connectivity with our customers and supply base to better understand demand and supply impacts on their operations. We believe our value as a distributor has grown over the past several years as we have demonstrated reliability, consistency, and security of supply. We work to meet demand requirements through our extensive network, installed asset base, transportation and digital assets, and supplier partnerships, supported by our network of solution centers and technically-trained professionals with deep industry knowledge. A summary of our sales channel and underlying end market performance as of March 31, 2023, with corresponding impacts from the current environment are as follows (percentages represent 2023 first quarter consolidated net sales): _Chemicals and Services (67%) - Within our Chemicals and Services sales channel, we continue to see_ resilient growth in inorganic chemistries as well as our Energy and Mining markets. We have a focus on expanding our role in Municipal and Industrial Water treatment, with a wide array of chemistries and services designed to help manage and purify water. In our core chemical distribution, we are seeing lower demand in product sales; however, cost and pricing remains higher as the prior period inflation is entrenched in the supply chain. We are seeing pockets of increased demand in select end markets tied to electric vehicle and green energy production. _Ingredients and Specialties (33%) - Our Ingredients and Specialties sales channel has experienced the_ impacts of a decline in consumer demand, particularly within Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants, and Elastomers and Personal Care, as customers react to lower demand, a need to destock existing inventories, and some deflationary pressures. We are encouraged by our Pharma and Lubricants businesses as we drive ongoing business activity with the support of our formulations lab and technically focused sales strategy. In Food, we are seeing the benefits of our specialty ingredients focus, despite the volatility in certain pricing categories. In Household and Industrial Cleaning, we are beginning to see the return of the automotive care industry as pricing normalization returns. A summary of our sales channel and underlying end market performance as of December 31, 2022, with corresponding impacts from the current environment are as follows (percentages represent 2022 consolidated net sales): _Chemicals and Services (66%) - Our Chemicals and Services sales channel saw strong growth over the_ course of the year with many of the core industries seeing accelerated demand and resilient pricing. Our continued focus on putting the customer at the center of all we do has led to above-market growth in chemical manufacturing, 90 ----- mining and energy. Our complete offering of water treatment chemistries allows us to provide both municipalities and industrial customers with solutions for managing and purifying water. We are beginning to accelerate our offerings into the North American electronics market, with high-purity chemistries necessary for manufacturing microchips. Additionally, we saw growth in agricultural chemistries, pulp and paper and in general manufacturing. Our services business had top-line growth as we improved our service capabilities and we saw a slight rebound in automotive manufacturing. The recent rise in interest rates causes us some concern that global industrial production decline may dampen the demand for our products; however, we anticipate a higher value on increased carrying costs of working capital. _Ingredients and Specialties (34%) - Our Ingredients and Specialties sales channel saw strong growth_ throughout the year in both our end markets as well as in a number of our differentiated chemistries. We saw particularly strong growth in our Pharmaceuticals business, which has continued to grow since the pandemic on increasing demand for high-purity actives, excipients and other necessary ingredients. Our food ingredients business saw strength throughout the year on security of supply and a partnership with our suppliers and customers to provide solutions that cater to consumer trends. Our beauty and personal care business saw another year of growth on product management and new supplier authorizations. Within our CASE business, we saw product tightness and inflation for much of the year. The slowdown in housing construction resulting from higher interest rates during the back half of the year dampened demand; however, our service performance and product offering allowed for topline growth. The lubricants and metalworking business finished the year with market share gain as well as margin expansion on good pricing discipline. Finally, the homecare and industrial cleaning business finished the year with sales growth on pricing discipline and further supplier development.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

With the Nexeo acquisition integration and system migration completed, we look to continue to leverage our digital investments to drive organic growth through market share capture and margin gains through leverage of our cost structure. Management is focused on the following financial objectives: - growth above consensus GDP; - consolidated Reported Adjusted EBITDA growth and corresponding Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion; - increased return on invested capital; - maintaining targeted leverage levels; and - growing inorganically through bolt-on acquisitions. Achievement of these objectives is expected through the following operational initiatives: - application of a consistent global strategy, while driving local execution; - leverage of our global transportation and digital asset footprint; - solutions to support suppliers’ and customers’ ESG objectives; - delivery of an effortless experience for customers that drives preference and retention; - focus on technical and application development offerings; 91 ----- - unlocking our global solution centers’ value for suppliers and customers; - leverage and expansion of our key supplier relationships, with the goal of enhancing service to key global customers; - capitalize on U.S. re-industrialization and near-shoring trends; and - execute accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities in regions and markets where we believe there are synergistic opportunities for growth, cross-selling and cost rationalization. The Company believes that its results for the first quarter of 2023, which were impacted by destocking, are illustrative of quarterly expectations for the remainder of the year before giving effect to cost savings and announced acquisitions. The Company’s cost savings initiatives for the year ending December 31, 2023 are underway and are expected to be achieved in the second half of the year. In addition, the impact of destocking as a result of supply chain disruptions in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 has generally abated in the second quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the trend of higher volumes during the summer months is expected to impact our working capital requirements in line with historical norms.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.32,Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.32.1,,"Historically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operations and borrowings under its committed Senior ABL Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2023, liquidity for the Company was $1,147.6 million, comprised of $377.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $769.9 million of available borrowings under its credit facility. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries and secured by such parties’ eligible accounts receivable, inventory and cash with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion. Significant reductions in our accounts receivable, inventory and cash would reduce our availability to access liquidity under the credit facility. We have no active financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreements; however, there is a springing fixed charge coverage ratio (“FCCR”) under the revolving credit facility of 1.0x, applicable only if availability is less than or equal to 10% of the borrowing capacity. If the FCCR was applicable, the calculation would have been 5.0x as of March 31, 2023. Our primary short-term liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures, other liabilities including environmental remediation and interest, possible business acquisitions, share repurchases and general corporate purposes. The majority of our debt obligations mature in 2026 and beyond. To the extent that our cash balances from time to time exceed amounts that are needed to fund our immediate liquidity requirements, we will consider alternative uses of some or all of such excess cash. Such alternatives may include, among others, the redemption or repurchase of debt securities or other borrowings through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Refer to “Note 11: Debt” in our audited consolidated financial statements and “Note 7: Debt” in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information related to our debt obligations. Management continues to balance its focus on sales and earnings growth with continuing efforts in cost control and working capital management. Access to debt capital markets has historically provided the Company with sources of liquidity beyond normal operating cash flows. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future with our history of favorable results in the debt capital markets and strong relationships with global financial institutions. However, our ability to continue to access the debt capital markets with favorable interest rates and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on maintaining our current ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies. We may from time to time refinance or take steps to reduce debt or interest costs. The amount of debt, if any, that may be reduced or refinanced will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. On October 27, 2022, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (“Senior ABL Facility”), which provided a five-year senior secured ABL credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion and a five-year senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Senior ABL Facility amends and restates in full the amended and restated ABL facility entered into by the Company on February 28, 2019. In connection with the entry into the Senior ABL Facility, the Company terminated its existing European ABL Credit Agreement and the Euro ABL Facility thereunder. 105 ----- Our defined benefit pension plans had an underfunded status of $82.7 million and $122.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on current projections and minimum funding requirements, we expect to make cash contributions of $16.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2023. The amount and timing of any such requirement in future years is uncertain given the implicit uncertainty regarding the future developments of factors described in “Risk Factors”.

Additionally, the Company uses Reported Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align management compensation measurement with operational performance. We define Reported Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of consolidated net income; depreciation; amortization; net interest expense; income tax expense; impairment charges; (gain) loss on sale of business; other operating expenses, net and other (expense) income, net (for both, see “Note 8: Supplemental financial information” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information). For 2020, Reported Adjusted EBITDA also included an adjustment to remove a Brazil VAT charge. See below for a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Reported Adjusted EBITDA. We believe other financial measures, as defined below, that do not comply with GAAP provide relevant and meaningful information concerning the ongoing and future operating results of the Company. - Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation): net sales less cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation); - Gross margin: gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) divided by external sales on a segment level and by net sales on a consolidated level; and - Reported Adjusted EBITDA margin: Reported Adjusted EBITDA divided by external sales on a segment level and by net sales on a consolidated level. We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing information on a constant currency basis provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency percentages and other information by converting our financial results in local currency for a period using the average exchange rate for the prior period to which we are comparing. The non-GAAP financial measures noted above are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. They are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help investors’ ability to analyze underlying trends in the Company’s business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in its industry and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results.

See “Use of Proceeds.” We expect the cash requirements of the Transactions to be financed through the net proceeds from this offering, proceeds from our Credit Facilities, the Equity Contribution and cash from the balance sheet of Univar. On a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, assuming cash and cash equivalents of Univar as of the closing of the Merger of approximately $377.7 million, we would have had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $100.0 million immediately after the closing of the Transactions. The actual amount of cash available as a source of funds for the Transactions and post-closing will depend on, among other things, transaction fees and expenses, the actual closing date of the Merger, the actual amount of cash to be received upon the termination of interest rate and cross currency swaps, interest paid on the Company’s indebtedness prior to the closing date of the Transactions, actual prepayment penalties and premiums in connection with the repayment in full of the Company’s existing indebtedness and changes in working capital and operating cash flows prior to the closing date of the Transactions. We believe that our cash on hand and availability under the ABL Facility will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses in the near term. We expect that other sources of cash required to pay our operating expenses for the remainder of 2023 will consist of cash flows provided by our operations and available borrowings under the ABL Facility. Based on estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million as of March 31, 2023, approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding, each as of the closing date of the Transactions, we would have had approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of March 31, 2023 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. Upon completion of this offering, our long-term debt for borrowed money will be comprised of the notes and indebtedness under the Credit Facilities. After the consummation of the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity will be cash on the balance sheet, cash generated by operations and borrowings under the ABL Facility. Our primary uses of cash after the consummation of the Transactions will be working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital expenditures. Based on our current level of operations and available cash, we believe our cash flows from operations, combined with availability under the ABL Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, debt service requirements and capital spending requirements over the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to do so depends on prevailing economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital, and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be highly levered. On a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2023, we would have had outstanding $4,600.0 million in aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding capital and financing leases), with approximately $677.9 million available for borrowing under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing base 110 ----- availability of approximately $1,307.2 million, approximately $500.0 expected to be drawn as of the closing date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the closing date). Our liquidity requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt service requirements. On a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, our cash interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 would have been approximately $393.6 million. Assuming the ABL Facility is fully drawn, each 0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $4.6 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the Credit Facilities. The foregoing pro forma interest expense information does not give effect to any future hedging strategies. From time to time, depending upon market and other conditions, as well as upon our cash balances and liquidity, we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may acquire our outstanding debt securities or our other indebtedness through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we, our subsidiaries or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures, if applicable), for cash or other consideration.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

We perform an annual goodwill impairment assessment at the reporting unit level each year as of October 1, or more frequently if potential impairment indicators exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. A reporting unit’s carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, including corporate allocations, based on the enterprise approach. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant assumptions include forecasted EBITDA, market segment growth rates and discount rates based on a reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore impact a reporting unit’s fair value in excess of carrying value assessment. Through qualitative assessments performed on the USA, EMEA, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific reporting units, we concluded that it was more likely than not that each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value. As such, a quantitative assessment was not performed for any of our reporting units.

See “Note 18: Commitments and contingencies” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. Our environmental liabilities are subject to numerous uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate our costs, or our share of costs if multiple parties are responsible. These uncertainties involve the legal, regulatory and enforcement parameters governing environmental assessment and remediation, the nature and extent of contamination at the sites, the extent and cost of assessment and remediation efforts required, our insurance coverage for the sites and, in the case of sites with multiple responsible parties, the number and financial strength of those parties. In addition, our determination as to whether a loss is probable may change, particularly as new facts emerge as to the causes of contamination.

A reduction of the carrying values of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, forecasted and appropriate character of future taxable income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and feasible tax strategies.

In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers. We also have state-of-the-art solution centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles. Each of these locations is staffed by a team of chemists and food scientists, many with doctorate-level educations. At the heart of our business model are our highly trained professionals with deep industry experience within the specific markets they serve. We serve a diverse set of end markets and regions, with no end market accounting for more than 18% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.47,BUSINESS Company Overview,17.47.2,,"We are a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as a provider of value-added services, to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals and ingredients from thousands of producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell those materials safely to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120 countries. Our go-to-market approach focuses on leveraging the scale of our operations and our local industry and geographic knowledge to create differentiated value for our customers and suppliers. This is primarily achieved through our Chemicals & Services (“C&S”) channel, through which we can leverage the scale of our operations and is intensely focused on customer service, and our Ingredients & Specialties (“I&S”) channel, which focuses on specialty chemicals and ingredients paired with in-depth technical expertise. This dualchannel approach allows us to meet the specific needs of each customer across their entire product development, commercialization, and raw material purchasing journey, creating value across the entire customer production chain. Our C&S channel features a broad portfolio of commodity products and we believe that our focus on customer service in this business channel allows us to gain a competitive advantage over other players operating in the market. Our I&S channel leverages the breadth of our supplier and customer relationships and a technically focused sales process aimed at achieving new authorizations and customer and volume retention. We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, including approximately 9,700 employees and 600 facilities, supported by the largest private transportation fleet in the industry: approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers; and approximately 2,500 railcars, 120 rail and barge terminals and 20 deep sea terminals, focused on timely and safe delivery to a spectrum of customers, large and small. With our global sales force, a vast supplier network, unparalleled logistics know-how, deep market and regulatory knowledge, world-class formulation and recipe development, and industry-leading digital tools, we are committed to helping customers and suppliers anticipate and navigate today’s challenges and capture the meaningful growth opportunities that exist in their industries. Beyond traditional distribution services, our value-added services include e-commerce, digital marketing, chemical waste management, on-site storage, packaging, private label and technical application and formulation support for industries such as Beauty and Personal Care, Food, Pharma, CASE, Lubricants and Metalworking, Homecare and Industrial Cleaning, Agricultural, Water Treatment, and Electronics. Our scale, along with our dense logistics network, long-standing regulatory permits, exclusive product offering of premier brands, centralized business technology infrastructure, industry-leading safety record, and valueadded services, along with established relationships with the leading chemicals and ingredients producers in our industry allow us to meet the end market, technical development, and material supply needs of our customers, while serving as an extension of our premier suppliers. This approach allows us to execute an intense focus on service, while lowering costs. While the global chemical distribution industry is large and highly fragmented, with thousands of distributors, it represents a relatively small portion of all chemical industry sales. While the total chemical and ingredient industry is projected to grow at rates close to the gross national product of the countries in which we operate around the world, the distributed chemicals portion of the industry is projected to grow at a faster rate as producers and customers increasingly realize the economic benefits of this channel. Suppliers rely on us to warehouse, repackage, transport, market and sell their products as a way to expand their industry access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their chemical and ingredient sourcing process through access to just-in-time delivery, excellent product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals fully compliant with increasing local and federal regulations. 115 ----- Chemical distributors play an essential role within the global chemical and ingredient value chain by providing customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals that create value-added products. While certain chemical and ingredient producers choose to directly serve large, global end users, there are also thousands of smaller, regional customers who may be more economically served by distributors given their more “local” reach and last-mile expertise.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

We offer more than 15,000 products to a broad range of end markets across both the C&S and I&S channels. _C&S. Our C&S product portfolio primarily includes a wide range of organic and inorganic_ chemistries, surfactants, inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout most end markets. C&S products are typically sold in higher volumes and we believe that our success in C&S has been enabled by our ‘customer centric’ selling model, coupled with our facility, transportation and digital asset bases, and our extensive supplier partnerships. We operate a global business, featuring the largest chemical distribution network in both the U.S. and Canada, as well as scaled platforms in Europe and Latin America where we were the second and fifth largest distributor by sales, respectively, in each case in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. We are intensely focused on customer service and satisfaction which leads to high levels of customer retention, as well as extensive product expertise across our portfolio. We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the market and allow us to compete across our end markets: - we operate an expansive North American site network and approximately 80% of our U.S. manufacturing GDP is located within a 60-minute drive time from one or more of our facilities; - we offer a highly diversified product portfolio and maintain appropriate inventory levels throughout the year to ensure security of supply to our customers; - we have invested in a strong digital platform that allows us to identify orders, target customers, access real-time pricing information and ensure the availability of freight-logical product where and when it is needed; - we offer competitive pricing for our products while delivering attractive levels of profitability; and - we are contracted and work closely with the leading suppliers in the industry and maintain an expert sales force with deep ties to customers to market and sell their product into the market. We have established clear goals within our C&S channel. We are targeting organic growth of over 100 basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 22% over the next three to five years. We also have clear strategic priorities for C&S to ensure we continue to gain share within our core markets and continue our track record of delivering strong growth, including: - execution of strategic capital investments to ensure high levels of service, improved safety and the ability to maximize growth in a dynamic market; - continuing to compete successfully at the local level with global scale, matching the intensity of our more regional competitors with our advantageous size and scale; and - remaining “Easy to Do Business With” for our customers and suppliers as a trusted distributor in our industry. _I&S. Our Ingredients and Specialties channel serves a more value added, higher-growth portion of the_ market tailored to specific end market requirements. For each I&S market, we have dedicated sales, marketing, product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of the markets they serve. We 117 ----- represent approximately 500 strategic specialty and ingredient chemical suppliers and sell their portfolios to approximately 42,000 customer locations around the world. These specialty products are typically sold in lower volumes, but at a higher gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), than commodity products. These products also tend to provide “sticky” business as they become vital components to customers’ procurement needs. In I&S, sustained growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce effectiveness, delivering solutions through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our comprehensive supply chain infrastructure. I&S focuses on seven global markets and is serviced through our Life Sciences (Beauty & Personal Care, Food Ingredients and Pharmaceutical Ingredients) and Industrial Solutions (CASE, Homecare & Industrial Cleaning and Lubricant & Metalworking Fluids) businesses. We believe that the following characteristics of our model, among others, help differentiate us in the market and allow us to compete across our customer and end markets: - strong formulation know-how and application laboratories to innovate with customers, including through our industry-leading laboratory capabilities; - ability to meet our customers’ needs with a comprehensive product portfolio and industry focus sales, marketing and product management; - reliable “on time in full” delivery and supply assurance, underpinned by strong relationships between customers and company service representatives; and - partnerships with high-quality suppliers and brands with high-quality products across end markets, including securing exclusive relationships for premium parts of our portfolio where we operate symbiotically with our suppliers. We have established clear goals within our I&S channel. We are targeting organic growth at over 200 basis points above GDP and stable gross profit margins of approximately 28% over the next three to five years. To achieve these financial objectives, our key strategic priorities include: - dedicated industry and sub-market focus through sales, product management, marketing, and regulatory capabilities to deliver relevant support to customers and suppliers; - leading technical capabilities through our global solution center network and application development experts, drawing on deep resources across inventory and logistics experts, scientists, PhDs, procurement, customer service, sales and marketers to deliver consultative services and an unmatched portfolio to solve customers’ formulation and operational challenges; and - continued expansion of our specialty product portfolio and market penetration through organic and inorganic growth.

We are well positioned to benefit from the growing trend of chemical and ingredient producers and customers outsourcing key tasks to distributors. Third-party chemical and ingredient distribution represents a small portion of the industry, with distributors underpenetrated relative to other industries (including building materials, steel, auto parts and others). However, the industry remains large with global third-party chemical distribution industry sales of approximately $320 billion in 2022. Historically, chemical distribution was viewed as a channel to reach smaller customers but is increasingly important to larger customers. The relatively low current penetration rate, combined with rising regulatory requirements, an increased focus on ESG, customer regionalization, and supplier globalization, are expected to be strong tailwinds for increased outsourcing penetration across both specialty and commodity chemicals. It is a highly fragmented industry with a significant number of small, local participants; our scale provides a meaningful competitive advantage. As a full-line distributor with a strong, highly scaled supply-chain-network across a broad geographic region, we are well suited to help customers and producers consolidate their distributor relationships and lower their total costs of ownership while improving upon their service levels. Amidst a backdrop of industry-wide underinvestment in software and digitization, we have a “First Mover” advantage derived from our leading proprietary platform. Our advanced centralized business platform simplifies logistics and reduces complexity and costs.

We track worker injuries using the OSHA standardized methodology of TCIR which is the rate of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked. 2022 was our safest year on record with a TCIR of 0.33, compared with 0.40 in 2021 and ahead of our 2025 target of 0.38. We believe this results in a competitive advantage by: - maintaining and improving relationships with our customers and suppliers, who view safety performance as a key criterion for vendor selection; - improving employee recruitment and retention; and - reducing the likelihood of incidents and enabling our employees to focus on their contributions. Additionally, we believe our focus on safety improves our service, productivity and financial performance. We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that meet growing customer and societal sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that our ability to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and industry developments. We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to these expectations through our global sustainability goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while addressing remediation, reducing resource use, progressing responsible sourcing and bringing more sustainable solutions to market. In 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular Economy’ as a goal to 2021. In 2021, we developed and shared longer term ESG goals to 2025, 2030 and 2050. Throughout 2022 we continued to implement our strategies to drive progress on these goals. 128 ----- We incorporate ESG initiatives into our business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and value creation. We continually strive to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce our environmental impact and increase transparency.

1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.66,INDUSTRY The Chemical and Ingredient Distribution Industry,17.66.1,,"Distributors play an essential role within the global chemical value chain by providing customers of all sizes access to mission-critical chemicals and ingredients that underpin their commercial products. While suppliers are able to directly serve large end-users, there are many thousands of smaller customers who require chemical and ingredient inputs that are not economic for large producers to serve. Distributors fill this gap by purchasing chemicals and ingredients from producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport, and sell those chemicals to customers through a more regional supply chain and at volumes that may be meaningfully below traditional order sizes for producers. Chemical and ingredient producers rely on distributors to market and sell their products – to expand their industry access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Distributors may also offer additional services like formulation, technical and engineering consulting, digital insights, and guidance around regulations. At the same time, customers that purchase through distribution benefit from a lower total cost of ownership and simplify their chemical and ingredient sourcing process with benefits including just-in- time delivery, excellent product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending, and technical expertise. There are many factors that can influence customer preference when evaluating which distributor(s) to partner with, including: - **Scale and logistics network – Locality and network breadth to ensure chemicals can be received quickly and at volume. Proximity to customers also drives engagement and enables logistical flexibility for the distributor; - **Availability of a broad range of products – Access to a sizeable portfolio and inventory of chemicals that can meet all of the customer’s needs and are available when such needs arise. A broad portfolio allows customers to source from a single distributor, simplifying operations and lowering costs; - **Technical expertise and service – Customer centricity and strong chemical and ingredient know how – including the ability to jointly innovate with customers and match their needs and capabilities to the required chemical and ingredient inputs, particularly for smaller customers who may not have internal technical resources; and - **Quality of supplier and brands – Partnership with leading producers to ensure a consistent and reliable supply of chemical product, primarily sourced within the geographies of the customer to ensure security of supply. 139 ----- At the same time, suppliers are seeking distributors who demonstrate the following: - **Scale and extensive logistics network – Strong presence in regions where suppliers’ products are in demand, as well as strong logistics capabilities to handle transportation, storage and delivery of products across a wide range of products and volumes; - **Technical expertise and market knowledge – A deep understanding of both products being distributed, as well as markets being served (including key players, trends and regulatory requirements) to provide insights and analysis to suppliers; - **Financial stability – A solid financial track record and strong creditworthiness to ensure shipments are paid on time and consistent investments are made in the business over the long-term; - **Brand awareness – Reputable track record in distribution to support suppliers’ own brand recognition and perception of quality in the market; and - **Digital as a trend – Advanced digital capabilities to provide insights into customer behavior, which can then be used to strengthen both the producer and the distributor’s positions within a given market.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.67,Distribution Models,17.67.1,Commodity chemical distributors,"Commodity chemical distributors focus on standardized chemicals that have minimal variation per application. Commodity chemicals are often used as the starting material to produce a wide variety of other chemicals and tend to have transparent pricing, with producers typically selling large volumes to their customers. Examples of commodity chemicals include ethylene, propylene, phenol, methanol, and formaldehyde. The Univar Solutions product portfolio principally includes a wide range of organic and inorganic chemistries, surfactants, inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout most end markets. For these commodity chemical distributors, product availability, logistical network and customer service are essential differentiators for customers, given the limited potential for product differentiation. For suppliers, scale, reliability and reputation are key success factors when selecting a distributor. Suppliers favor commodity chemical 140 ----- distributors with broad logistical networks and a suitable inventory across a comprehensive product portfolio, particularly if they are able to enable expansion beyond that supplier’s existing offering (either via incremental endmarkets or new geographic markets). The ability to purchase higher volumes is also attractive for suppliers, who thus favor larger-scale commodity chemical distributors in order to reach smaller, more regionalized customers. Additionally, greater scale gives us better insight into market trends, generating a better understanding of real-time demands of customers, greater market insights, and a higher level of technical expertise. Switching costs are however low for suppliers, and relationships are generally not exclusive. Given the commodity focused nature, these distributors typically operate lower-margin, higher-volume business models, relative to other distributors. However, given the relatively low cost of commodity chemicals, these products make up a limited portion of a customer’s total costs, and as a result, customers tend to be inclined to maintain relationships with their distributors if products are delivered safely and on-time. Despite selling relatively standardized products, commodity chemical distributors vary significantly to chemical traders. The trader business model is predicated largely on the purchase and sale of bulk chemicals, given the relatively transparent pricing and spot markets. While commodity chemical distributors also generate value through their ability to maintain a spread between purchase and selling price, they differ greatly given their intense customer focus and value-additive service offering embedded within their business model. Commodity chemical distributors maintain a highly complex logistical network to ensure that customers are able to receive their products in a timely manner, given their mission critical status to most operations. At the same time, these chemicals are often hazardous and difficult-to-handle, adding an additional layer of complexity that distributors manage for both suppliers and customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.67,Distribution Models,17.67.2,Specialty chemical distributors,"Specialty chemical distributors focus on complex and tailored formulations that target specific applications within a given end market. Specialty chemical pricing is based on the value added by the product and is generally sold by a skilled and technical salesforce that is able to create or recommend customized formulations for their end customers. Specialty chemical distributors operate on a lower-volume, higher-margin model. While less capital-intensive than commodity chemicals, scale remains vital in specialty chemical distributors, as it allows companies to leverage a larger product portfolio to gain more touch points across suppliers and customers. Sometimes, less technical logistical and warehousing operations are outsourced to third parties, while technical marketing and business development are crucial activities performed in-house. Examples of categories of specialty chemicals include construction chemicals, adhesives, food additives, and surfactants. In their production, specialty chemicals undergo a complicated value chain. They generally begin as commodity chemicals, which are essentially used as raw materials that undergo reactions to form chemical intermediates. From there, specific chemical or biological reactions are performed to further refine these intermediates into specialty chemicals and ingredients. Oftentimes, several reactions and processes must be performed to create a specific specialty product. Due to the complexity of this value chain, specialty chemicals are generally sold as downstream products and tailored for niche end markets. For specialty distributors, domain expertise in a given end market is essential, alongside the ability to create tailor-made solutions for customers. To this end, supplier relationships are essential and often exist on an exclusive basis. Thus, switching costs are generally high, and specialty chemicals are not easily replaceable with one another in comparison to commodity chemicals, particularly to smaller customers for whom custom formulations have been prepared.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.67,Distribution Models,17.67.3,Full-line distributors,"Full-line distributors encompass both commodity and specialty products to provide end-to-end chemical solutions to customers. This model is pursued by large global players with scale, such as Univar Solutions and Brenntag, to enable a sophisticated business model that can effectively serve both commodity and specialty customers despite their contrasting needs. Our commodity channel is reported as C&S. The C&S channel is characterized by two core competencies: Local Chemical Distribution (“LCD”) and Bulk Chemical Distribution (“BCD”). In LCD, we are the largest while 141 ----- having a strong local presence as a distributor throughout the United States and Canada with the most extensive network and facility capabilities. We are able to receive product in barge, rail and truck and deliver to our customers by rail, truck and parcel, outlining the extent of our reach. In BCD, we are a market leader in the United States and Canada for six major inorganic chemistries. We are able to demonstrate producer-like economies of scale with distributor level logistics. The C&S channel also offers differentiating services like MiniBulk, a high retention, safe, full-service model for difficult-to-handle chemicals, and ChemCare, a waste chemical collection and disposal service. Due to the capital-intensive nature of commodity distribution, our expansive scale offers numerous advantages including its denser logistics network, broad stock availability, competitive pricing, and deeper supplier and customer relationships. Our specialty channel is reported as I&S. I&S is powered by dedicated sales, marketing, product management and technical services dedicated to each end market we serve. Additionally, our global network of solution centers focused on product formulation, technical differentiation, and problem solving. Despite the specialty chemical and ingredient distribution channel being less capital-intensive by nature, our large scale still proves to be advantageous, as its scale provides its customers with access to a stronger product portfolio, supply assurance, technical expertise, and a broader range of value-added services that are essential and often don’t exist inhouse. For full-line distributors including Univar Solutions, there are synergies between operating both business models. The critical size in storage and logistics required for the commodity channel supports the specialty channel by enabling a broader product suite to be supported by a distribution infrastructure enabling effective logistics to clients. Overall, the full-line distributor model can take advantage of industry growth trends across a range of end markets and maintain diversification and stability, thus lowering overall business volatility.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Customers generally seek a “one-stop shop” distributor with strong industry knowledge, multiple product lines, and various geographic regions and end markets served. Likewise, suppliers prefer to work with fewer distributors in order to reduce costs and complexities that arise from dealing with multiple distributors. The key drivers for market consolidation include: - **Building scale in existing geographies and channels and broadening geographic reach – Distributors seek to capture a higher number of customers in both their existing geographies, as well as in new markets. In turn, this benefits suppliers who also seek a broader distribution network for their products, particularly in geographies that it is not economical or practical for them to serve directly; - **Bolt-on acquisitions – Distributors acquire local or regional distributors that service suppliers with whom they already have a strong relationship within other geographies, both to reduce complexity and to create a “one-stop shop” for the supplier. These acquisitions are generally performed to strengthen supplier-distributor relationships; - **Greater efficiency and ease of business for customers – Distributors consolidate with the goal of channel expansion by acquiring smaller companies to improve supplier relationships and product mix. This strengthens the value proposition for customers that seek large distributors with a broad product portfolio; - **Vertical integration – Both acquisitions of upstream or downstream companies in the chemical value chain allow distributors to expand capabilities, reduce risk of supply chain disruptions and capture a larger portion of the total value transferred and added; and - **Increased capabilities and value-added services – New services strengthen the distributor's value proposition for both customers and suppliers that seek market expertise and value-added services.

Due to regulation, increased focus on sustainability, digitization, regionalization, and globalization of supply, outsourcing is expected to increase by 10bps per year, driving approximately 1% of incremental Chemical Distribution market growth annually. Many suppliers turn to third-party distributors to manage supply-chain operations. This ensures that suppliers can focus on core capabilities such as manufacturing and R&D, while allowing distributors to focus on sales and complexity issues beyond suppliers’ expertise. Outsourcing penetration in specialty chemicals is lower than that of commodities due to the more specialized production techniques, greater demands in product handling and transportation, increased technical expertise needed to sell specialty products and the more niche end market applications. 144 ----- There are a number of trends supporting a longer-term increase in outsourcing to chemical distributors in the medium to long- term: - Suppliers seeking to reduce complexity by transferring smaller customers to distributors and consolidating distribution channels (benefiting large and scaled distributors); - As customer differentiation increases, higher complexity within smaller customer channels arises, which is easier for distributors to manage; - Customers seeking increased value-added services and formulation support with digital technology capabilities, which distributors are continuing to invest in; - Geographic reach in growth markets, such as Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America, where distributors have better access; and - Increasing regulatory requirements in developed markets (including increased focus on ESG) and demand for compliance in emerging markets that a distributor is better suited to handle and more experienced in. Based on our survey of suppliers, over 75% of suppliers expect both specialty and commodity outsourcing in North America, Europe and APAC to grow over the next three years. Supplier expectations for outsourcing penetration vary by channel and region. In Europe, 86% of suppliers expect growth in specialty, while 94% expect growth in commodity. In North America, 83% of suppliers expect growth in specialty, while only 76% expect growth in commodity. Overall, suppliers expect North American chemical distribution outsourcing penetration to reach approximately 22-23% by 2027 while in Europe, it is expected to reach approximately 12% by 2027.

At the option of the Issuer, funds managed by Affiliates, or certain investment Affiliates, of the Sponsors and the Co-Investors will (i) enter into one or more equity commitment letters pursuant to which they will, among other things, agree to contribute cash and/or Cash Equivalents directly or indirectly to the Issuer in an amount equal to all or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption occurs (each, a “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letter” and collectively, the “Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters”) and/or (ii) in lieu of all or a portion of such amount, deposit or cause to be deposited an amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents (either in the form of cash or letters of credit). The Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters, if applicable, will automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the Special Mandatory Redemption and (ii) the date of satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions (as defined below). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” As long as Escrowed Property is deposited with the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property in such Cash Equivalents as the Issuer will from time to time direct in writing. The Issuer will grant, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes, a firstpriority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property to secure the Notes Obligations pending disbursement as described below. The ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon such funds or securities held in the Escrow Account may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or the Escrow Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds—If a bankruptcy or reorganization case is commenced, the escrowed funds might be deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate such that bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of funds in the escrow account and the holders of the notes might become unsecured creditors.” The Issuer may cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property by delivering to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee, on or before the Escrow Outside Date, an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Officer’s _Certificate”) instructing the Escrow Agent to release the escrowed funds and certifying to the effect that:_ (1) the Merger will be consummated on the date of release of the Escrowed Property in all material respects as described under “Summary—The Transactions”; (2) the Issuer has entered into the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility or will substantially concurrently with the release of the Escrowed Property enter into the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility; and (3) equity investments in the Issuer, directly or indirectly, by funds affiliated with the Sponsors and the Co-Investors will have been made and borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility will be available in an aggregate amount sufficient, when taken together with the Escrowed Property and the cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company, to consummate the Merger and to pay related fees and expenses (clauses (1), (2) and (3), collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”).

The Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, or delivered electronically 160 ----- if held by DTC, no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date. Such notice will provide that all of the notes shall be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the indenture on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. In connection with such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrow Agent will release funds from the Escrow Account to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall pay such amounts to the paying agent (if other than the Trustee), in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption. Upon the deposit of funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price in respect of the notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date with the Trustee or the paying agent on or before such date, the notes will cease to bear interest and all rights under the indenture and the notes shall terminate. If at any time the Escrow Account contains cash and Cash Equivalents having an aggregate value, together with the amount of commitments under the Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters and the face amount of any letters of credit, in excess of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, upon written instruction of the Issuer to the Escrow Agent, such excess cash and Cash Equivalents may be released to (or at the direction of) the Issuer or the amount of commitments under such Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters or the face amount of any such letters of credit may be reduced. On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, upon written instruction of the Issuer, the Trustee will pay to (or at the direction of) the Issuer any Escrowed Property in excess of the amount necessary to effect the Special Mandatory Redemption, plus any outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee and Escrow Agent. If the Issuer is able to consummate the Merger on the Issue Date, then the Issuer may elect to forego the escrow procedures described above in their entirety, in which case there would be no Escrow Agreement, Escrow Account or Sponsor Escrow Interest Commitment Letters. No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the Escrowed Property) may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially adversely affect the holders of the notes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) without the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding. No provisions of the indenture with respect to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the notes through a Special Mandatory Redemption may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially adversely affect the holders of the notes without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note affected. “Escrow Account” means a segregated account that includes only cash and Cash Equivalents, the proceeds thereof and interest earned thereon. “Special Mandatory Redemption Date” means the fifth Business Day after the Special Termination Date. “Special Mandatory Redemption Price” means a price equal to the issue price of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

In the event that the Merger is not consummated on the Issue Date, the notes will have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property so long as the proceeds of any notes remain in the Escrow Account. From and after the Escrow Release Date, pursuant to the Security Documents, the First Lien 161 ----- Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will have the benefit of (i) a first-priority security interest in the Notes Priority Collateral, which will also secure all other First-Priority Obligations on a first-priority basis and the ABL Obligations on a junior-priority basis and (ii) a second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral, which will also secure the ABL Obligations on a first-priority basis and the First-Priority Obligations on a second-priority basis, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions described under the caption “—Security.” From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes Obligations will rank effectively senior to the ABL Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral, and effectively junior to the ABL Obligations, to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral. From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes Obligations will be pari passu with all other First-Priority Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Notes Priority Collateral and the ABL Priority Collateral, will rank effectively senior to all unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors and to all Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors secured by junior liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to all future Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors that is secured by assets or properties not constituting Collateral securing the notes. At March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries would have had (a) approximately $4,100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness constituting First-Priority Obligations, consisting of the notes and $2,300.0 million (equivalent) outstanding under the Credit Agreement and (b) approximately $677.9 million of borrowings available and undrawn under the $1,400.0 million ABL Facility (as a result of estimated borrowing base availability of approximately $1,307.2 million and after giving effect to approximately $500.0 million expected to be drawn as of the Merger Closing Date and approximately $129.3 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding as of the Merger Closing Date). Certain hedging, cash management and bank product arrangements that are entered into with the lenders under the ABL Facility will be secured by the same collateral that secures the ABL Facility. Although the indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. The Issuer and its Subsidiaries are able to Incur additional amounts of Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to certain limitations, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness, including Secured Indebtedness constituting ABL Obligations or additional First-Priority Obligations. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Unless a Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the notes. The notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to holders of indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor. As of the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer’s only Subsidiaries that will not be Subsidiary Guarantors will be (i) Foreign Subsidiaries, (ii) non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and (iii) Domestic Subsidiaries that (w) are Immaterial Subsidiaries, (x) are prohibited by any applicable contractual requirement or requirement of law from guaranteeing the notes on the Escrow Release Date or that would require consent, approval, license or authorization of a Governmental Authority to guarantee the notes (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received), including special purpose Subsidiaries, (y) are FSHCOs or (z) are Subsidiaries of (A) any of the Subsidiaries described in preceding clauses (ii) or (iii) or (B) any Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC. As of March 31, 2023, on a historical basis, the Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries had approximately 36% of the Issuer’s total assets and approximately $387.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany obligations. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a historical basis, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have generated approximately 34% of the Issuer’s total operating revenues and approximately 34% of the Issuer’s Reported Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in this offering memorandum). The foregoing information with respect to the non-guarantor Subsidiaries does not give effect to pro forma adjustments for the Transactions.

None of the First-Priority Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First-Priority Collateral Agent or any other First-Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First-Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition or realization of such Collateral. If any First-Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of First-Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First-Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the First-Priority Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including any case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law).

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will further provide that, if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (the “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First-Priority Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or any Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object to (and not to otherwise contest), and will be deemed to have consented to, any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the “DIP _Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling_ Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First-Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Common Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First-Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First-Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (B) the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First-Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First-Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First-Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and 169 ----- (D) if any First-Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; _provided, that the First-Priority Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_ secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First-Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and provided, further, that the First-Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First-Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First-Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First-Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the First-Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First-Priority Obligations Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First-Priority Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Although the holders of Non-ABL Obligations (including the holders of the notes) and ABL Obligations will not be parties to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the instruments evidencing such Obligations, each agrees to be bound thereby. In addition, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it may be amended from time to time to add additional secured parties with respect to other Non-ABL Obligations and ABL Obligations to the extent not prohibited to be incurred under the indenture, the ABL Facility Documents and other agreements governing such Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will allocate the benefits of any Collateral between the holders of the ABL Obligations on the one hand and the holders of the NonABL Obligations on the other hand. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things: - Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any ABL Obligations (the “ABL Liens”), the Liens securing any Non-ABL Obligations (the “Non-ABL Liens”), the defects or deficiencies in any such Liens or other circumstances whatsoever, (1) the ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral will rank senior to any Non-ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral, and (2) the Non-ABL Liens on the Notes Priority Collateral will rank senior to any ABL Liens on the Notes Priority Collateral. - Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, and no holder of, any class of Applicable Obligations may contest or support any other person in contesting the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, or holder of, any other class of Applicable Obligations. - Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Prior to the Discharge of the ABL Obligations, the ABL Collateral Agent will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the First-Priority Collateral Agent to take limited protective measures with respect to the Non-ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL 170 ----- Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral. Upon any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on such item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released. - Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the Notes Priority Collateral. Prior to the Discharge of the Non-ABL Obligations, the First-Priority Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Applicable Authorized Representative) will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the Notes Priority Collateral (subject to the right of the ABL Collateral Agent to take limited protective measures with respect to the ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the Notes Priority Collateral. Upon any sale of any Notes Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such Notes Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of such First-Priority Collateral Agent on such item of Notes Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of Notes Priority Collateral will be automatically released. - Application of Proceeds and Turn-Over Provisions. In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or including in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (x)(1) all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all ABL Obligations in accordance with the ABL Facility, before being applied to any Non-ABL Obligations; and (2) after the Discharge of ABL Obligations, if any Non-ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Non-ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement; and (y)(1) all proceeds of Notes Priority Collateral shall be applied to NonABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement, before being applied to the ABL Obligations; and (2) after the Discharge of Non-ABL Obligations, if any ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of Notes Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding ABL Obligations in accordance with the ABL Facility. If any holder of any Applicable Obligations or if any Applicable Collateral Agent receives any proceeds of Collateral in contravention of the foregoing, such proceeds will be turned over to the Applicable Collateral Agent entitled to receive such proceeds pursuant to the prior sentence, for application in accordance with the prior sentence. - Amendment and Refinancings. The ABL Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations may be amended or refinanced subject to continuing rights of the holders of such refinancing Indebtedness under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement. - Tracing of Proceeds. Each Applicable Collateral Agent will agree, that prior to any issuance of notice of an exercise of remedies by any other Applicable Collateral Agent (unless a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default then exists), any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited under control agreements, which are used by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to acquire other property which is Collateral shall not (solely as between the Collateral Agents) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral which was so acquired.

(iii) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any holder of ABL Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral; (iv) any sale or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code if the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of ABL Obligations shall have consented to such sale or disposition of the ABL Priority Collateral; and (v) any order relating to a sale of assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor constituting ABL Priority Collateral for which the ABL Collateral Agent has consented which provides that, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, the Liens securing the ABL Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing such Obligations on the assets being sold, in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; - the First-Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral without the prior consent of the ABL Collateral Agent or oppose any request by the ABL Collateral Agent for relief from such stay with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral;

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also contain similar reciprocal restrictions on the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations applicable during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for customary access and use of the Notes Priority Collateral for purposes of exercising remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and that the ABL Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations shall be deemed separate classes of secured obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

From and after the Escrow Release Date, each of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) and that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement will jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally, guarantee on a senior secured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the indenture and the notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantors being herein called the “Guaranteed _Obligations”). The Guaranteed Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor will be secured by a first-priority security_ interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Notes Priority Collateral owned by such Subsidiary Guarantor and by a second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such Subsidiary Guarantor. Such Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee in enforcing any rights under the Subsidiary Guarantees. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes and guarantees and any related security interests and require noteholders to return payments received.” After the Escrow Release Date, the Issuer will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) that Incurs or guarantees certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the notes on the same senior secured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” 174 ----- Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and shall: (1) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor; (2) subject to the next succeeding paragraph, be binding upon each such Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors; and (3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns. Each Subsidiary’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically released upon any of the following: (1) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock (including any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer following which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary), of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the indenture; (2) (i) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii) the occurrence of any other event following which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in a manner not in violation of the indenture; (3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the notes; (4) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance” or if the Issuer’s obligations under the indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the indenture; (5) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest in favor of the First-Priority Obligations or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof, subject to, in each case, the application of the proceeds of such foreclosure or exercise of remedies in the manner described under “—Security”; (6) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that following a Reversion Date, if any, each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be reinstated to the extent and within the timeframe required under the fifth paragraph under “—Certain Covenants” and “—Certain Covenants—Future Subsidiary Guarantors”; (7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary or upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, in a manner not in violation of the indenture; and (8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, securitizations or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Credit Agreement and the ABL Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions on certain events that could constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the notes upon a 176 ----- Change of Control could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not cause a default under such Indebtedness, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” under New York law, which governs the indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of any Indebtedness or Lien denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness or Lien was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness or Lien is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness or a Lien denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S. dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness or Lien does not exceed the outstanding or, if greater, committed principal amount of the Indebtedness or Lien being refinanced plus the Additional Refinancing Amount. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness or Liens that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur under the indenture shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness or Liens, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness or Lien Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness or a Lien, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness or Lien being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness or Lien is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

In the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified in reliance on the “Cumulative Credit” or clause (21) above or clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” (collectively, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that may be made pursuant to the Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially concurrent Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an Incurrence Clause or the incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any such Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof). In the event a Restricted Payment or Investment permitted under clause (4) or (8) above or the definition of “Permitted Investment” is permitted up to an amount per annum, any unused amounts in any calendar year shall be permitted to be carried over to any subsequent calendar year. In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or similar event relating to the payment or making of an Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event, the Issuer or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event as having occurred on the date of the commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) (or, at the election of the Issuer or applicable Restricted Subsidiary, on any date subsequent thereto, even if a prior date was previously the Election Date hereunder, in which case from and after such election such subsequent date shall be deemed the “Election Date” hereunder) if, after giving pro forma effect to such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the indenture, and any related subsequent actual declaration, payment or making of such Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or other relevant event will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such calculations on and after such Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement, declaration, notice, action or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith). As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated on such date of designation will be deemed to be an Investment in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”. Notwithstanding any of the definitions or covenants contained in this “Description of Notes” to the contrary, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any transaction that results in the transfer (whether by way of any Restricted Payment, Investment, or any disposition, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions), directly or indirectly, of the ownership of the Univar Trademarks to any Unrestricted Subsidiary. 194 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Within 18 months after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its option: (1) to repay (i) Indebtedness constituting First-Priority Obligations (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), (ii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, (iii) Obligations under the notes, (iv) other Pari Passu Indebtedness other than First-Priority Obligations so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral (provided that, if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall so reduce Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness that does not constitute First-Priority Obligations under this clause (iv) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include Indebtedness described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) even if such Indebtedness may also constitute Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuer will 197 ----- equally and ratably reduce Notes Obligations either, as the Issuer shall elect in its sole discretion, as provided under “Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof or, in the event that the notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase a pro rata principal amount of notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event that the notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any), or (v) if all or any portion of such proceeds are from an Asset Sale of ABL Priority Collateral (including indirect Asset Sales of ABL Priority Collateral due to the sale of the Capital Stock of a Person), any Indebtedness under the ABL Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require a reduction of the commitments thereunder); or (2) to make an acquisition or investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or in an increase in the percentage ownership by the Issuer (or a Restricted Subsidiary) in such Restricted Subsidiary), assets, or property or capital expenditures or New Projects, in each case (a) used or useful in a Similar Business or (b) that replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or, in each case, to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Proceeds was contractually committed, or to make an investment in one or more New Projects, or to make acquisitions or investments not prohibited by the indenture. In the case of clause (2) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application from the date of such commitment until the 24-month anniversary of the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds; provided that in the event such binding commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason after the 18-month anniversary of the receipt of such Net Proceeds but before an amount equal to such Net Proceeds is so applied, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within six months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding commitment; provided, further, that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may only enter into a Second Commitment under the foregoing provision one time with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before an amount equal to such Net Proceeds is applied or is not applied within six months of such Second Commitment, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any amount, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may use such amount in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. If the Issuer has not applied an amount equal to such Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale as provided and within the time period set forth in the two immediately preceding paragraphs of this covenant, then, in lieu of applying such amount in such manner, such unapplied amount (it being understood that any amount used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted and such amount shall not constitute Excess Proceeds (any amounts that do not constitute Excess Proceeds as a result of this parenthetical, “Retained Asset Sale Proceeds”)) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that, if (i) the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of the Issuer is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00 but greater than 3.75 to 1.00 at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds or at any time during such time period, an amount equal to 50% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall not be required to be applied as set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) above and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and 50% of any existing Excess Proceeds shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds, and (ii) the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of the Issuer is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00 at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds or at any time during such time period, none of the amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall be required to be applied as set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) above or constitute Excess Proceeds and any existing Excess Proceeds shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds (any amounts that do not constitute Excess Proceeds, or no longer constitute Excess Proceeds, as a result of the application of clause (i) or clause (ii) of this proviso, together with any Retained Asset Sale Proceeds, “Available Proceeds”). If the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all holders of notes (and, at the option of the Issuer, to holders of any other First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral, other Pari Passu Indebtedness) (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness), that is a minimum principal amount of $2,000 and 198 ----- an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event the notes or such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be offered to the holders of such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness), to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200 million by mailing, or delivering electronically if held by DTC, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $200 million or less (it being understood that such amount used to make an Asset Sale Offer shall satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such amount of Net Proceeds whether or not such Asset Sale Offer is accepted and shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds). The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any Available Proceeds and, to the extent that the aggregate amount of notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral, other Pari Passu Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any such amounts (“Declined Proceeds”), in each case, for any purpose that is not prohibited by the indenture and shall not be required to use them for any other purpose. If the aggregate principal amount of notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or other Pari Passu Indebtedness) surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall select the notes to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any Declined Proceeds upon such completion). The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the indenture by virtue thereof. If more notes (and such First-Priority Obligations or, so long as the Net Proceeds are with respect to assets not constituting Collateral, other Pari Passu Indebtedness) are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuer is required to purchase, selection of such notes for purchase will be made by the Issuer in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed (and the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable, by lot or by such other method as the Issuer deems appropriate (and in such manner as complies with the requirements of DTC, if applicable); provided that no notes of a minimum of $2,000 or less shall be purchased in part.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. - **Defaults An “Event of Default” will be defined in the indenture as: (1) a default in any payment of interest on any note when due, continued for 30 days; (2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise; (3) failure by the Issuer for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the provisions of the indenture described in “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”; (4) the failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with its other obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) contained in the notes or the indenture; (5) the failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Permitted Securitization Financing) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $150 million or its foreign currency equivalent; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary); 207 ----- (7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $150 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days (the “judgment default provision”); (8) a material portion of the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the notes provided by the Subsidiary Guarantors cease to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or shall be asserted in writing by any Subsidiary Guarantor not to be in effect or not to be legal, valid and binding obligations (other than in accordance with the terms thereof); (9) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the indenture, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the Liens in favor of the holders of the notes with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable and such Default continues for 30 days; or (10) the failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice to the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor with its other agreements contained in the Security Documents except for a failure that would not be material to the holders of the notes and would not materially affect the value of the Collateral taken as a whole. The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3), (4), (9) or (10) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Issuer or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuer, with a copy to the Trustee, of the default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause (3), (4), (9) or (10) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes by notice to the Issuer, with a copy to the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the indenture or the Security Documents at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, 208 ----- premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered and, if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such holders) or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must mail, or deliver electronically if held by DTC, to each holder of the notes notice of the Default within the later of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, annually, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the indenture and such notice references the notes and the indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the Trustee or holders of the notes (or any other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders of the notes, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default or notice of acceleration (or other action).",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.15,Certain Covenants,59.15.9,,"Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture then, beginning on such date (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will not be applicable to the notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”): (1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” (2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;” (3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries;” (4) “—Asset Sales;” (5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;” (6) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;” and (7) “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Subsidiary Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. The Issuer will provide the Trustee with written notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date within five Business Days of the occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of 177 ----- the notes or monitor or provide notice to the holders of the notes of the occurrence of any such Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date. On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments. Any Affiliate Transactions entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period (to the extent that such agreement was not entered into in contemplation of such Reversion Date) shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, the Issuer must comply with the terms of the covenant described under “—Future Subsidiary Guarantors.” For purposes of the “—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. For purposes of determining compliance as of any date with the indenture (other than for purposes of calculating financial ratios or as set forth in the second to last paragraph set forth in “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or the definition of “Consolidated Total Indebtedness”), amounts incurred, invested, loaned, advanced, acquired, disposed of, sold, declared, paid, distributed or otherwise made or outstanding in any currency other than the applicable currency in which such basket, threshold or other amount is denominated shall be calculated based on exchange rates in effect on the date of incurrence, investment, loan, advance, acquisition, disposition, sale, declaration, payment, distribution or other similar action was taken (or committed, at the option of the Issuer) as determined in good faith by the Issuer. If any limitation, threshold, ratio or basket is exceeded solely as a result of changes in currency exchange rates after the last time it was utilized, such limitation, threshold, ratio or basket will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates. No Default or Event of Default shall arise as a result of any limitation, threshold, ratio or basket in the indenture (or in the definition of any defined term used in such sections) being exceeded solely as a result of changes in currency exchange rates.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

In addition, no provision of the indenture with respect to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the notes through a Special Mandatory Redemption may be amended or waived in a manner that would materially adversely affect the holders of the notes without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note affected.

Any_ such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Issuer, to reflect (1) operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings reasonably expected to result from the applicable event (including, to the extent applicable, the Transactions), (2) all adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as set forth in footnote 1 to the “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Data” under “Summary” in this offering memorandum to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such Pro Forma Period (other than the “Normalization of supply chain disruption and destocking” adjustment, which shall only be applicable for the year ended December 31, 2022 (and quarters within such year) and not applied to any period thereafter) and (3) anticipated run-rate EBITDA reasonably expected to be achieved (in the good faith determination of the Issuer) from New Projects (and the achievement of related operating expense reductions and other operating improvements, synergies or cost savings associated therewith) so long as such New Project is then under development or is otherwise in process. 231 ----- If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

At any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to (i) change all terms under GAAP to be GAAP in effect from time to time and (ii) change all terms under GAAP to be GAAP in effect as of a certain date, in each case, by giving notice of such election and the effective date of such election to the Trustee.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Pro Forma EBITDA Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP.

1634,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,95,BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM,95.1,The Global Notes,95.1.1,,"We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if 256 ----- applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts.

This summary addresses only Holders who acquire the notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agencies or wholesalers) and hold their notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders in light of their particular circumstances or to Holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein), tax-exempt entities, U.S. expatriates, U.S. Holders that hold notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary, non-U.S. trusts and estates that have U.S. beneficiaries, persons holding notes in a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction or as a position in a constructive sale or straddle, persons subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is other than the U.S. dollar or persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and under the control of one or more U.S. persons, or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes an individual, corporation, trust or estate and that is not a U.S. Holder. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes. Similar requirements may apply to investments by plans, arrangements, or accounts, such as governmental plans, certain church plans, and non-U.S. plans, and entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans, arrangements, or accounts (collectively, “Other Plan Investors”), that are subject to laws, regulations, or policies that are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Each ERISA Plan and Other Plan Investor should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) will act as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor with respect to the decision to acquire notes or an interest in a note pursuant to this offering and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The decision to acquire notes or an interest in a note must be made by each prospective ERISA Plan and Other Plan Investor purchaser on an arm’s-length basis. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such ERISA Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction with an ERISA Plan may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan who caused the ERISA Plan to engage in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the notes or an interest in a note are acquired with the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of ERISA Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers) (collectively, “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a party in interest or disqualified person that is a service provider to an ERISA Plan investing in securities for adequate consideration, provided such service 265 ----- provider is not (i) the fiduciary with respect to the ERISA Plan’s assets used to acquire the securities or an affiliate of such fiduciary or (ii) an affiliate of the employer sponsoring the ERISA Plan (the “Service Provider Exemption”).However, there can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider Exemption, or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. Other Plan Investors, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before acquiring the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

As discussed in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively F 2 ----- “environmental remediation work”) at approximately 128 locations. In determining the appropriate level of environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors such as information obtained from investigatory studies, scope of the remediation and related changes, the interpretation, application and enforcement of laws and regulations, changes in the costs of remediation programs, the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods, and the relative level of the Company’s involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. Auditing management’s accrual for environmental liabilities was especially challenging because it involves judgmental underlying assumptions, including remediation methods, remediation time horizon and remediation cost estimates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the accrual for environmental liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the environmental liability calculations and the significant assumptions and data inputs used by management. To test the accrual for environmental liabilities, we involved our specialist to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company’s calculation and underlying assumptions. We performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing key methodologies and testing the significant assumptions and the underlying data used by management. For example, we tested the site’s current remediation status and remediation strategy, which included an analysis of the site’s remediation timeline, regulatory requirements, remediation actions and related technologies. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010.

Each funded defined benefit plan has an investment policy that is administered by plan trustees with the objective of meeting targeted asset allocations based on the circumstances of that particular plan. The investment strategy followed by the Company varies by country depending on the circumstances of the underlying plan. Less mature plan benefit obligations are funded by using more equity securities as they are expected to achieve long-term growth while exceeding inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using a higher allocation of fixed income securities as they are expected to produce current income with limited volatility. The Company has adopted a dynamic investment strategy whereby as the plan funded status improves, the investment strategy is migrated to more liability matching assets, and return seeking assets are reduced. Risk management practices include the use of multiple asset classes for diversification purposes. Specific guidelines for each asset class and investment manager are implemented and monitored. As noted above, substantially all of the UK Plan assets were within a buy-in contract as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, subsequent to the transaction executed in December 2021.

N/A N/A N/A 1.87% 2.91% 2.85% Discount rates are used to measure benefit obligations and the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost (income). The Company selects its discount rates based on the consideration of equivalent yields on high-quality fixed income investments at each measurement date. Discount rates are based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represent the rates at which the Company’s benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of the measurement date. For domestic defined benefit plans, the discount rates are based on a hypothetical bond portfolio approach. The hypothetical bond portfolio is constructed to comprise AA-rated corporate bonds whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the expected future plan benefit payments. The discount rates for the foreign defined benefit plans are based on a yield curve approach. For plans in countries with a sufficient corporate bond market, the expected future benefit payments are matched with a yield curve derived from AA-rated corporate bonds, subject to minimum amounts outstanding and meeting other selection criteria. For plans in countries without a sufficient corporate bond market, the yield curve is constructed based on prevailing government yields and an estimated credit spread to reflect a corporate risk premium. The discount rate to value UK Plan liabilities continues to be set with reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations on long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the benefit obligations. The long-term rate of return assumptions are based on the outlook for equity and fixed income returns, with consideration of historical returns, asset allocations, investment strategies and premiums for active management when appropriate. Assumptions reflect the expected rates of return at the beginning of the year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from singleemployer plans in the following aspects: - Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by the Company may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. - If the Company stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. Similarly, the Company could be liable for underfunded obligations of other, departed employers. - If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s participation in these plans for the annual period ended December 31, 2022 is outlined in the table below. The Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) zone status is the most recently available and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the “red zone” are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the “yellow zone” are less than 80 percent funded and plans in the “green zone” are at least 80 percent funded. The “FIP/RP status pending/implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented. In addition to regular plan contributions, the Company may be subject to a surcharge if the plan is in the red zone. The “Surcharge imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge has been imposed on contributions to the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective bargaining agreement(s) (“CBA”) to which the plans are subject. Contributions may be required in future periods by the CBAs, statutory obligations or other contractual obligations. If the Company were to cease making contributions to these plans at one or more or all locations, it could trigger a withdrawal liability that could be material to the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Calculating any such withdrawal liability depends on a number of factors that are out of the Company’s control and subject to change. A withdrawal liability represents an employer’s proportional share of the multi-employer plan’s unfunded vested benefits (“UVBs”). UVBs equal the value of non-forfeitable benefits owed by the plan, less the value of the plan’s assets. The value of assets and liabilities are determined using actuarial assumptions that reflect the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated UVBs for that employer. F 31 ----- A significant portion of the Company’s exposure historically resided with the eight facilities that participated in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (“Central States Pension Fund”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized its best estimate of a withdrawal liability of $31.2 million related to triggering events at all eight sites, culminating in the Company ceasing to participate in the Central States Pension Fund. Upon an agreed final funding assessment with the Central States Pension Fund, the Company will recognize any differences between the estimated and actual withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2022, this balance is unchanged. The Company estimates its cash obligation to be approximately $1.9 million annually for each of the next 20 years. The net present value of the withdrawal liability was determined using a riskfree interest rate. Amounts associated with the withdrawal liability are included in other operating expenses, net in the consolidated statements of operations and other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

On November 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the amount of authorized repurchases under the program of $1.0 billion, resulting in a total authorized repurchase amount of $1.5 billion. The program does not require the repurchase of any minimum number of shares and can be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may purchase shares from time to time at the discretion of management through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs, or other means. On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into an ASR with Goldman to repurchase $200.0 million of its common stock. On November 3, 2022, the Company paid $200.0 million to Goldman and received an initial delivery of approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock, which represented 75% of the notional value of the ASR divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 1, 2022. The final number of shares repurchased under the ASR was based on the daily volume-weighted average prices for Rule 10b-18 eligible transactions in the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR, less a discount and subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the ASR. In February 2023, the final settlement was determined to be an additional delivery of approximately 0.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock from Goldman. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate purchase price of the ASR was recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity, consisting of a $150.0 million increase in treasury stock to reflect the value of the initial share delivery and a $50.0 million decrease in additional paid-in capital pending final settlement of the ASR. The amount recorded in additional paid-in capital will be reclassified to treasury stock in the first quarter of 2023 in connection with the final settlement of the ASR. In addition to the ASR, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 7.7 million shares for $209.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 1.8 million shares for $50.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

For example, over the years, the Company has been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and/or similar state laws that impose liability for costs relating to environmental remediation work at various sites. As a PRP, the Company may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of certain sites. The Company is currently engaged in environmental remediation work at approximately 128 locations, some that are now or were previously Company-owned/occupied and some that were never Company-owned/occupied (“non-owned sites”). The Company’s environmental remediation work at some sites is being conducted pursuant to governmental proceedings or investigations. At other sites, the Company, with appropriate state or federal agency oversight and approval, is conducting the environmental remediation work voluntarily. The Company is currently undergoing remediation efforts or is in the process of active review of the need for potential remediation efforts at approximately 107 current or formerly Company-owned/occupied sites. In addition, the Company may be liable as a PRP for a share of the clean-up of approximately 21 non-owned sites. These non-owned sites are typically (a) locations of independent waste disposal or recycling operations with alleged or confirmed contaminated soil and/or groundwater to which the Company may have shipped waste products or drums for re-conditioning, or (b) contaminated non-owned sites near historical sites owned or operated by the Company or its predecessors from which contamination is alleged to have arisen. In determining the appropriate level of environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors such as information obtained from investigatory studies; the scope of remediation (including any changes over time); the interpretation, application and enforcement of laws and regulations; changes in the costs of remediation programs; the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; and the relative level of the Company’s involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. The level of annual expenditures for remedial, monitoring and investigatory activities will change in the future as major components of planned remediation activities are completed and the scope, timing and costs of existing activities are changed. Project lives, and therefore cash flows, may range from 2 to 30 years, depending on the specific site and type of remediation project. F 44 ----- Although the Company believes that its accruals are adequate for environmental contingencies, it is possible, due to the uncertainties noted above, that additional accruals could be required in the future that could have a material effect on the overall financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo”), an alternative asset manager, and Platinum Falcon B 2018 RSC Limited (“Platinum Falcon”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of the Company’s common stock (other than (a) certain shares owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise or by Parent or Merger Sub and certain shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of the Company, (b) shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and have complied with and have not waived, effectively withdrawn, or lost their right to appraisal under Delaware law with respect to such shares, and (c) shares covered by share awards granted subject to any time-based vesting, forfeiture, or other lapse restrictions), will be automatically converted into the right to receive $36.15 per share in cash, without interest. The Company’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2023. If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 at or after the Effective Time. The Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger is subject to the fulfillment or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, including other applicable antitrust and foreign investment reviews, and (iii) the absence of any order, decree, or ruling by any other governmental entity in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company have material business operations and the absence of any law, statute, rule, regulation, F 57 ----- decree, injunction, or order in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company have material business operations that prohibits or makes the consummation of the Merger illegal. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon certain unilateral closing conditions, including the other party’s representations and warranties being accurate (subject to certain customary materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects all obligations and complied in all material respects with its covenants in the Merger Agreement. The obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger is additionally conditioned upon the absence of a material adverse effect, as specified in the Merger Agreement, on the Company since the execution of the Merger Agreement. The availability of financing is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. See “Note 5: Supplemental financial information” for additional information on Merger transaction costs. The Company is required to pay Parent a termination fee of $204.2 million in cash upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, the Board of Directors effecting a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to enter into a definitive contract with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement also provides that a reverse termination fee of $379.2 million in cash will be payable by Parent to the Company under specified circumstances, including, among others, if (i) Parent fails to timely consummate the Merger following the completion of the Marketing Period (as defined in the Merger Agreement) after the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and the Company standing ready to consummate the Closing and (ii) Parent materially breaches its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements under the Merger Agreement such that there is a failure of certain conditions to the Merger that is not timely cured. The Merger Agreement further provides that a regulatory termination fee of $291.7 million in cash will be payable by Parent to the Company under specified circumstances, including if (i) the Company or Parent terminates the Merger Agreement as of the End Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and all conditions to Closing have been satisfied other than regulatory-related conditions (including approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) or (ii) the Company or Parent terminates the Merger Agreement due to a final, non-appealable order enjoining or prohibiting the Merger that relates to an antitrust or foreign investment law.

The ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose information about the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Retrospective application of the guidance is required for all disclosures except rollforward information, which requires prospective application.

These non-owned sites are typically (a) locations of independent waste disposal or recycling operations with alleged or confirmed contaminated soil and/or groundwater to which the Company may have shipped waste products or drums for re-conditioning, or (b) contaminated non-owned sites near historical sites owned or operated by the Company or its predecessors from which contamination is alleged to have arisen. In determining the appropriate level of environmental liabilities, the Company considers several factors such as information obtained from investigatory studies; the scope of remediation (including any changes over time); the interpretation, application, and enforcement of laws and regulations; changes in the costs of remediation programs; the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; and the relative level of the Company’s involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. The level of annual expenditures for remedial, monitoring, and investigatory activities will change in the future as major components of planned remediation activities are completed and the scope, timing, and costs of existing activities are changed. Project lives, and therefore cash flows, may range from 2 to 30 years, depending on the specific site and type of remediation project. Although the Company believes that its accruals are adequate for environmental contingencies, it is possible, due to the uncertainties noted above, that additional accruals could be required in the future that could have a material effect on the overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. Changes in total environmental liabilities, which were measured on an undiscounted basis, were as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,360

Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, monitors the operating results of its reportable segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Management evaluates performance of its reportable segments on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of consolidated net income; depreciation; amortization; net interest expense; income tax expense; impairment charges; (gain) loss on sale of business; other operating expenses, net and other (expense) income, net (for both, see “Note 5: Supplemental financial information”). Transfer prices between reportable segments are set on an arms-length basis in a similar manner to transactions with third parties. Corporate operating expenses that directly benefit segments have been allocated to the reportable segments. Allocable operating expenses are identified through a review process by management. The allocable operating expenses are assigned to the reportable segments on a basis that reasonably approximates the use of services, which is generally measured based on a weighted distribution of margin, asset, headcount, or time spent. Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,360
